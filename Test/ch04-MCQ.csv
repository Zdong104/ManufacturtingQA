Question,Answer
"Polymers typically exhibit greater thermal expansion properties than metals: (a) true, or (b) false.",Answer. (a)
"In the heating of most metal alloys, melting begins at a certain temperature and concludes at a higher temperature. In these cases, which of the following temperatures marks the beginning of melting? (a) liquidus, of (b) solidus.",Answer. (b)
"Which of the following materials has the highest specific heat? (a) aluminum, (b) concrete, (c) polyethylene, or (d) water.",Answer. (d)
"Copper is generally considered easy to weld, because of its high thermal conductivity: (a) true, or",Answer. (b) The high thermal conductivity of copper makes it difficult to weld because the heat flows away from the joint rather than being concentrated to permit melting of the metal.
"The mass diffusion rate dm/dt across a boundary between two different metals is a function of which of the following variables (more than one): (a) concentration gradient dc/dx, (b) contact area,","Answer. (a), (b), (e), and (f). This is perhaps a trick question. Choices (a) and (b) are included in Eq. (4.5). Temperature (e) has a strong influence on the diffusion coefficient. Time (f) figures into the process because it affects the concentration gradient; as time elapses, the concentration gradient is reduced so that the rate of diffusion is reduced."
"Which of the following pure metals is the best conductor of electricity? (a) aluminum, (b) copper,",Answer. (d)
"A superconductor is characterized by which of the following (choose one best answer): (a) very low resistivity, (b) zero conductivity, or (c) resistivity properties between those of conductors and semiconductors?",Answer. (b)
"In an electrolytic cell, the anode is the electrode which is (a) positive, or (b) negative.",Answer. (a)

(a) Centrifugal casting - This involves pouring molten metal into a rotating mold to produce cylindrical parts and is a permanent mold process because the mold can be reused.

(b) Die casting - This process involves injecting molten metal into a mold cavity under high pressure and is certainly a permanent mold process as the dies (molds) are reusable.

(c) Low pressure casting - This involves using low pressure to fill the mold with a metal and typically uses reusable molds, making it a permanent mold operation.

(d) Shell molding - This involves using a shell of resin-bonded sand to form the mold and is an expendable mold process because the shell is broken to remove the casting.

(e) Slush casting - This is a process to produce hollow castings by pouring out the excess molten metal after a shell has formed and typically utilizes reusable molds, thus making it a permanent mold process.

(f) Vacuum permanent-mold casting - This process uses vacuum to draw molten metal into the mold which is reusable, hence it is a permanent mold operation.

A branched molecular structure is stronger in the solid state and more viscous in the molten state than a linear structure for the same polymer: (a) true or (b) false.,Answer. (a),,B,"""Explanation"": In polymers, the molecular structure can significantly affect the physical properties. A branched molecular structure means that side chains are connected to the main chain of the polymer. This branching can lead to less efficient packing of the molecules in the solid state compared to a linear structure, which usually packs more tightly and neatly. As a result, the branched structure is generally less strong in the solid state than a linear structure. However, in the molten state, the branches can lead to entanglement, increasing viscosity more than in linear polymers. Therefore, the statement regarding the solid state strength being stronger for branched structures compared to linear structures is false, although the statement about viscosity in the molten state being higher is true. Since the question addresses both solid state strength and viscosity together, the overall statement given in the question is false.

(c) and (d).,,"B, C","""Explanation"": The glass transition temperature \(T_g\) is a critical property of amorphous thermoplastic polymers. It marks the temperature below which the polymer transitions from a rubbery, pliable state to a hard, brittle one. At this point, molecular motion becomes significantly restricted. The correct indicators of \(T_g\) include:

- (b) The coefficient of thermal expansion increases markedly. Below \(T_g\), the polymer's free volume decreases much less with decreasing temperature, so the coefficient of thermal expansion would change noticeably.
  
- (c) The slope of specific volume versus temperature changes markedly. \(T_g\) causes a kink or slope change in the plot of specific volume versus temperature as the material changes from a more flexible to a more rigid state.

Note: \(T_g\) does not involve a transformation to a crystalline structure, as amorphous polymers do not have an ordered structure like crystalline ones. Thus, option (a) is incorrect. \(T_g\) is not where the polymer solidifies from the molten state, which relates instead to the melting temperature; hence, (e) is not correct. While the state change into a stiffer form occurs near \(T_g\), ""stiff, strong, and elastic"" does not fully capture the nature of a polymer below \(T_g\), as it also becomes more brittle and glass-like, thus making option (d) not entirely accurate for indicating \(T_g\).

However, some specific formulations of polyurethane can also be thermoplastic.","A, B, C, E","""Explanation"": ""Thermoplastic polymers are materials that become soft when heated and harden upon cooling without undergoing any chemical change.

"Polystyrene (without plasticizers) is amorphous, transparent, and brittle: (a) true or (b) false.",Answer. (a),"Polystyrene is a synthetic aromatic hydrocarbon polymer made from the monomer known as styrene. It is well-known for being amorphous, meaning it lacks a crystalline structure, which contributes to its transparency. Additionally, unmodified polystyrene is inherently brittle at room temperature, without the presence of plasticizers that would otherwise enhance its flexibility. Therefore, the statement that polystyrene (without plasticizers) is amorphous, transparent, and brittle is accurate.",A,"""Explanation"": ""Polystyrene is a synthetic aromatic hydrocarbon polymer made from the monomer known as styrene.

"The fiber rayon used in textiles is based on which of the following polymers: (a) cellulose, (b) nylon, (c) polyester, (d) polyethylene, or (e) polypropylene.",Answer. (a),,A,"""Explanation"": Rayon is a type of synthetic fiber that is made from natural sources of cellulose, such as wood pulp. The process involves dissolving the cellulose to form a viscous solution which is then extruded through a spinneret and solidified to form fibers. This makes options such as nylon, polyester, polyethylene, and polypropylene incorrect, as these are synthetic polymers. Nylon is a synthetic polyamide, polyester is a category of polymers that contains the ester functional group, polyethylene is a polymer of ethylene, and polypropylene is a polymer of propylene. Therefore, the polymer that forms the basis of rayon is cellulose.

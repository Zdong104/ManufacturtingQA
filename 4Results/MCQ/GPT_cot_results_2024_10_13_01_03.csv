"Which one of the following casting processes is most widely used (one answer)? (a) centrifugal casting, (b) die casting, (c) investment casting, (d) sand casting, or (e) shell casting.",Answer. (d),"Sand casting is the most widely used casting process due to its versatility and cost-effectiveness. It is suitable for a wide range of metals and allows for a variety of sizes and complex shapes. It is commonly used for casting both ferrous and non-ferrous materials, and is popular for its low tooling costs and adaptability to different production volumes, making it the most prevalent method across various industries.",D,"""Explanation"": ""Sand casting is the most widely used casting process due to its versatility and cost-effectiveness.

"In sand casting, the volumetric size of the pattern is which of the following relative to the cast part? (a) bigger, (b) same size, or (c) smaller.",Answer. (a),"In sand casting, the pattern is made bigger than the actual cast part to account for the shrinkage that occurs as the metal cools and solidifies. This shrinkage allowance ensures that the final casting is of the desired size. Therefore, the volumetric size of the pattern is larger than the cast part to compensate for this shrinkage.",A,"""Explanation"": ""In sand casting, the pattern is made bigger than the actual cast part to account for the shrinkage that occurs as the metal cools and solidifies.

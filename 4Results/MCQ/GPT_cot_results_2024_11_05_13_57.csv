(a) Investment casting: This process uses a wax pattern, coated with a refractory material to form a mold. The mold is broken to retrieve the cast part. Hence, it is an expendable mold process.

(b) Low pressure casting: This process typically involves a reusable metal mold, thus it is not an expendable mold process.

(c) Sand casting: This process involves creating a mold from sand, which needs to be broken apart to remove the cast piece. It is an expendable mold process.

(d) Shell molding: Similar to sand casting, shell molding uses a resin-covered sand mold, which is destroyed to remove the cast part. It is an expendable mold process.

(e) Slush casting: This is a method for producing hollow parts without cores, typically applied in permanent mold operations, so it is not an expendable mold process.

(f) Vacuum molding: This technique involves a special sand mold held together by vacuum pressure. Once the vacuum is released, the mold collapses, so it is considered an expendable mold process.

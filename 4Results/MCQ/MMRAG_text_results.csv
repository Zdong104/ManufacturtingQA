Centrifuge Casting   In centrifuge casting, Figure 11.19, the mold is designed with  part cavities located away from the axis of rotation, so that the molten metal poured  into the mold is distributed to these cavities by centrifugal force. The process is used  for smaller parts, and radial symmetry of the part is not a requirement as it is for the  other two centrifugal casting methods.  

# 11.4 11.4  Foundry Practice  

In all casting processes, the metal must be heated to the molten state to be poured or  otherwise forced into the mold. Heating and melting are accomplished in a furnace.  This section covers the various types of furnaces used in foundries and the pouring  practices for delivering the molten metal from furnace to mold.  

# 11.4.1  FURNACES  

The types of furnaces most commonly used in foundries are (1) cupolas, (2) direct  fuel-ﬁ  red furnaces, (3) crucible furnaces, (4) electric-arc furnaces, and (5) induction  furnaces. Selection of the most appropriate furnace type depends on factors such  as the casting alloy; its melting and pouring temperatures; capacity requirements of  the furnace; costs of investment, operation, and maintenance; and environmental  pollution considerations.  

Cupolas   A cupola is a vertical cylindrical furnace equipped with a tapping spout  near its base. Cupolas are used only for melting cast irons, and although other fur- naces are also used, the largest tonnage of cast iron is melted in cupolas. General  construction and operating features of the cupola are illustrated in Figure 11.20. It  consists of a large shell of steel plate lined with refractory. The “charge,” consisting  of iron, coke, ﬂ  ux, and possible alloying elements, is loaded through a charging door  located less than halfway up the height of the cupola. The iron is usually a mixture  of pig iron and scrap (including risers, runners, and sprues left over from previous  castings). Coke is the fuel used to heat the furnace. Forced air is introduced through  openings near the bottom of the shell for combustion of the coke. The ﬂ  ux is a basic

compound such as limestone that reacts with coke ash and other impurities to form  slag. The slag serves to cover the melt, protecting it from reaction with the environ- ment inside the cupola and reducing heat loss. As the mixture is heated and melting  of the iron occurs, the furnace is periodically tapped to provide liquid metal for the  pour.  

Direct Fuel-Fired Furnaces   A direct fuel-ﬁ  red furnace contains a small open  hearth, in which the metal charge is heated by fuel burners located on the side of  the furnace. The roof of the furnace assists the heating action by reﬂ  ecting the ﬂ  ame  down against the charge. Typical fuel is natural gas, and the combustion products  exit the furnace through a stack. At the bottom of the hearth is a tap hole to release  the molten metal. Direct fuel-ﬁ  red furnaces are generally used in casting for melting  nonferrous metals such as copper-base alloys and aluminum.  

Crucible Furnaces   These furnaces melt the metal without direct contact with a  burning fuel mixture. For this reason, they are sometimes called  indirect fuel-ﬁ  red  furnaces . Three types of crucible furnaces are used in foundries: (a) lift-out type, (b)  stationary, and (c) tilting, illustrated in Figure 11.21. # Metal Casting  Processes

11.7 Product Design Considerations  

Metal casting processes divide into two categories, based  on mold type: (1) expendable mold and (2) permanent  mold. In expendable mold casting operations, the mold  is sacriﬁ  ced in order to remove the cast part. Since a new  mold is required for each new casting, production rates  in expendable-mold processes are often limited by the  time required to make the mold rather than the time  to make the casting itself. However, for certain part  geometries, sand molds can be produced and castings  made at rates of 400 parts per hour and higher. In per- manent mold casting processes, the mold is fabricated  out of metal (or other durable material) and can be used  many times to make many castings. Accordingly, these  processes possess a natural advantage in terms of higher  production rates.  

The discussion of casting processes in this chapter  is organized as follows: (1) sand casting, (2) other ex- pendable mold casting processes, and (3) permanent  mold casting processes. The chapter also includes cast- ing equipment and practices used in foundries. Another  section deals with inspection and quality issues. Product  design guidelines are presented in the ﬁ  nal section.

#  Sand Casting  

Sand casting is the most widely used casting process, ac- counting for a signiﬁ  cant majority of the total tonnage  cast. Nearly all casting alloys can be sand cast; indeed, it  is one of the few processes that can be used for metals  with high melting temperatures, such as steels, nickels,  and titaniums. Its versatility permits the casting of parts  ranging in size from small to very large and in produc- tion quantities from one to millions. Figure 11.1 shows a  cast iron sand casting of a pump housing that has been  partially machined to create accurate holes and surfaces.  

Sand casting , also known as  sand-mold casting , con- sists of pouring molten metal into a sand mold, allowing  the metal to solidify, and then breaking up the mold to  remove the casting. The casting must then be cleaned  and inspected, and heat treatment is sometimes required  

![](images/d0f22ae4cf5d5b45f4df1ceea2c7b0827d990b07c9b13928610143c4f027c31f.jpg)

to improve metallurgical properties. The cavity in the sand mold is formed by pack- ing sand around a pattern (an approximate duplicate of the part to be cast), and then  removing the pattern by separating the mold into two halves. The mold also contains  the gating and riser system. In addition, if the casting is to have internal surfaces (e.g.,  hollow parts or parts with holes), a core must be included in the mold. Since the mold  is sacriﬁ  ced to remove the casting, a new sand mold must be made for each part that  is produced. From this brief description, sand casting is seen to include not only the  casting operation itself, but also the fabrication of the pattern and the making of the  mold. The production sequence is outlined in Figure 11.2. # Part III   Solidiﬁ  cation  Processes

This part of the book covers those manufacturing  processes in which the starting work material is either  a liquid or is in a highly plastic condition, and a part  is created through solidiﬁ  cation of the material. Cast- ing and molding processes dominate this category of  shaping operations. With reference to Figure 10.1, the  solidiﬁ  cation processes can be classiﬁ  ed according to  the engineering material that is processed: (1) metals,  (2) ceramics, speciﬁ  cally glasses,  and (3) polymers and  polymer matrix composites (PMCs). Casting of metals  is covered in this and the following chapter. Glasswork- ing is covered in Chapter 12, and the processing of poly- mers and PMCs is treated in Chapters 13 and 14.  

Casting  is a process in which molten metal ﬂ  ows by  gravity or other force into a mold where it solidiﬁ  es in  the shape of the mold cavity. The term  casting  is also  applied to the part that is made by this process. It is one  of the oldest shaping processes, dating back 6000 years  (Historical Note 10.1). The principle of casting seems  simple: melt the metal, pour it into a mold, and let it  cool and solidify; yet there are many factors and vari- ables that must be considered in order to accomplish a  successful casting operation.  

Casting includes both the casting of ingots and the  casting of shapes. The term  ingot  is usually associ- ated with the primary metals industries; it describes a  large casting that is simple in shape and intended for

# Historical Note 10.1  Origins of casting  

Casting of metals can be traced back to around 4000  B . C . E . Gold was the ﬁ  rst metal to be discovered and  used by the early civilizations; it was malleable and  could be readily hammered into shape at room tem- perature. There seemed to be no need for other ways  to shape gold. It was the subsequent discovery of cop- per that gave rise to the need for casting. Although  copper could be forged to shape, the process was  more difﬁ  cult (due to strain hardening) and limited to  relatively simple forms. Historians believe that hun- dreds of years elapsed before the process of cast- ing copper was ﬁ  rst performed, probably by accident  during the reduction of copper ore in preparation for  hammering the metal into some useful form. Thus,  through serendipity, the art of casting was born. It is  likely that the discovery occurred in Mesopotamia, and  the “technology” quickly spread throughout the rest  of the ancient world.  

It was an innovation of signiﬁ  cant importance  in the history of mankind. Shapes much more intri- cate could be formed by casting than by hammering.  More sophisticated tools and weapons could be fab- ricated. More detailed implements and ornaments  could be fashioned. Fine gold jewelry could be made  more beautiful and valuable than by previous meth- ods. Alloys were ﬁ  rst used for casting when it was  discovered that mixtures of copper and tin (the alloy  thus formed was bronze) yielded much better cast- ings than copper alone.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec11.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec11.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec10.txt","0.829879969155174, 0.8276406252174864, 0.8258442221864922"

This increase is called the pattern shrinkage allowance, ensuring that the final casting is the correct size after cooling."", ""YourChoice"": ""A""","In addition, various machines have  been developed to mechanize the packing procedure. These machines operate by  any of several mechanisms, including (1) squeezing the sand around the pattern  by pneumatic pressure; (2) a jolting action in which the sand, contained in the  ﬂ  ask with the pattern, is dropped repeatedly in order to pack it into place; and  (3) a slinging action, in which the sand grains are impacted against the pattern at  high speed.  

An alternative to traditional ﬂ  asks for each sand mold is  ﬂ  askless molding , which  refers to the use of one master ﬂ  ask in a mechanized system of mold production.  Each sand mold is produced using the same master ﬂ  ask. Mold production rates up  to 600 per hour are claimed for this more automated method [8].  

Several indicators are used to determine the quality of the sand mold [7]:  (1)  strength —the mold’s ability to maintain its shape and resist erosion caused by  the ﬂ  ow of molten metal; it depends on grain shape, adhesive qualities of the binder,  and other factors; (2)  permeability —capacity of the mold to allow hot air and  gases from the casting operation to pass through the voids in the sand; (3)  thermal  stability —ability of the sand at the surface of the mold cavity to resist cracking  and buckling upon contact with the molten metal; (4)  collapsibility —ability of  the mold to give way and allow the casting to shrink without cracking the casting;  it also refers to the ability to remove the sand from the casting during cleaning;  and (5)  reusability —can the sand from the broken mold be reused to make other  molds? These measures are sometimes incompatible; for example, a mold with  greater strength is less collapsible.  

Sand molds are often classiﬁ  ed as green-sand, dry-sand, or skin-dried molds.  Green-sand molds  are made of a mixture of sand, clay, and water, the word  green   referring to the fact that the mold contains moisture at the time of pouring. Green- sand molds possess sufﬁ  cient strength for most applications, good collapsibility,  good permeability, good reusability, and are the least expensive of the molds. They  are the most widely used mold type, but they are not without problems. Moisture in  the sand can cause defects in some castings, depending on the metal and geometry  of the part. A  dry-sand mold  is made using organic binders rather than clay, and the  mold is baked in a large oven at temperatures ranging from $200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to $320^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ( $(400^{\circ}\mathrm{F}-$ $600^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ ) [8]. Oven baking strengthens the mold and hardens the cavity surface. A  dry-sand mold provides better dimensional control in the cast product, compared  to green-sand molding. However, dry-sand molding is more expensive, and produc- tion rate is reduced because of drying time. Applications are generally limited to  medium and large castings in low to medium production rates. In a  skin-dried mold ,  the advantages of a dry-sand mold is partially achieved by drying the surface of a  green-sand mold to a depth of 10 to  $25~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.4–1 in) at the mold cavity surface,  using torches, heating lamps, or other means. Special bonding materials must be  added to the sand mixture to strengthen the cavity surface.  

The preceding mold classiﬁ  cations refer to the use of conventional binders con- sisting of either clay-and-water or ones that require heating to cure. In addition to  these classiﬁ  cations, chemically bonded molds have been developed that are not  based on either of these traditional binder ingredients. Some of the binder materials

Following solidiﬁ  cation and cooling, the sand mold is broken away from the casting  to retrieve the part. The part is then cleaned—gating and riser system are separated,  and sand is removed. The casting is then inspected (Section 11.5).  

#  Other Expendable-Mold Casting Processes  

As versatile as sand casting is, there are other casting processes that have been  developed to meet special needs. The differences between these methods are in the  composition of the mold material, or the manner in which the mold is made, or in  the way the pattern is made.  

# 11.2.1  SHELL MOLDING  

Shell molding is a casting process in which the mold is a thin shell (typically 9 mm  or 3/8 in) made of sand held together by a thermosetting resin binder. Developed in  Germany during the early 1940s, the process is described and illustrated in Figure 11.5.  

There are many advantages to the shell-molding process. The surface of the  shell-mold cavity is smoother than a conventional green-sand mold, and this  smoothness permits easier ﬂ  ow of molten metal during pouring and better surface  ﬁ  nish on the ﬁ  nal casting. Finishes of  $2.5\ \mu\mathrm{m}$  ( $100~\mu$ -in) can be obtained. Good

FIGURE 11.5  Steps in shell-molding: (1) a match-plate or cope-and-drag metal pattern is heated and placed over a  box containing sand mixed with thermosetting resin; (2) box is inverted so that sand and resin fall onto the hot pattern,  causing a layer of the mixture to partially cure on the surface to form a hard shell; (3) box is repositioned so that loose,  uncured particles drop away; (4) sand shell is heated in oven for several minutes to complete curing; (5) shell mold is  stripped from the pattern; (6) two halves of the shell mold are assembled, supported by sand or metal shot in a box,  and pouring is accomplished. The ﬁ  nished casting with sprue removed is shown in (7).  

dimensional accuracy is also achieved, with tolerances of  $\pm0.25~\mathrm{mm}$  ( $(\pm0.010\$  in)  possible on small-to-medium-sized parts. The good ﬁ  nish and accuracy often pre- cludes the need for further machining. Collapsibility of the mold is generally suf- ﬁ  cient to avoid tearing and cracking of the casting.  

Disadvantages of shell molding include a more expensive metal pattern than the  corresponding pattern for green-sand molding. This makes shell molding difﬁ  cult to  justify for small quantities of parts. Shell molding can be mechanized for mass pro- duction and is very economical for large quantities. It seems particularly suited to  steel castings of less than 20 lb. Examples of parts made using shell molding include  gears, valve bodies, bushings, and camshafts.  

# 11.2.2  VACUUM MOLDING  

Vacuum molding, also called the  V-process , was developed in Japan around 1970. It  uses a sand mold held together by vacuum pressure rather than by a chemical binder.  Accordingly, the term  vacuum  in this process refers to the making of the mold rather  than the casting operation itself. The steps of the process are explained in Figure 11.6.  

! In sand casting, liquid metal is supplied  to the cavity by means of risers (Section 10.3.5). In die casting (Section 11.3.3), the  molten metal is applied under pressure.  

Pattern-makers account for thermal contraction by making the mold cavities  oversized. The amount by which the mold must be made larger relative to the ﬁ  nal  casting size is called the  pattern shrinkage allowance . Although the shrinkage is  volumetric, the dimensions of the casting are expressed linearly, so the allowances  must be applied accordingly. Special “shrink rules” with slightly elongated scales are  used to make the patterns and molds larger than the desired casting by the appropri- ate amount. Table 10.1 lists typical values of linear shrinkage for various cast metals;  these values can be used to determine shrink rule scales.  

# 10.3.4  DIRECTIONAL SOLIDIFICATION  

In order to minimize the damaging effects of shrinkage, it is desirable for the  regions of the casting most distant from the liquid metal supply to freeze ﬁ  rst and  for solidiﬁ  cation to progress from these remote regions toward the riser(s). In this  way, molten metal will continually be available from the risers to prevent shrink- age voids during freezing. The term  directional solidiﬁ  cation  is used to describe  this aspect of the freezing process and the methods by which it is controlled. The  desired directional solidiﬁ  cation is achieved by observing Chvorinov’s rule in  the design of the casting itself, its orientation within the mold, and the design of the riser  system that feeds it. For example, by locating sections of the casting with lower  V / A ratios away from the riser, freezing will occur ﬁ  rst in these regions and the supply of liq- uid metal for the rest of the casting will remain open until these bulkier sections solidify.  

Another way to encourage directional solidiﬁ  cation is to use  chills —internal  or external heat sinks that cause rapid freezing in certain regions of the casting.  Internal chills  are small metal parts placed inside the cavity before pouring so that  the molten metal will solidify ﬁ  rst around these parts. The internal chill should have  a chemical composition similar to the metal being poured, most readily achieved by  making the chill out of the same metal as the casting itself.  

![](images/1db4e1837b6cee2d1fe501d6bcbcab40c5637157277faab6472f82e3d533b694.jpg)  
FIGURE 10.9  (a) External chill to  encourage rapid  freezing of the molten  metal in a thin section  of the casting; and (b)  the likely result if the  external chill were not  used.  

External chills  are metal inserts in the walls of the mold cavity that can remove  heat from the molten metal more rapidly than the surrounding sand in order to  promote solidiﬁ  cation. They are often used effectively in sections of the casting  that are difﬁ  cult to feed with liquid metal, thus encouraging rapid freezing in these  sections while the connection to liquid metal is still open. Figure 10.9 illustrates a  possible application of external chills and the likely result in the casting if the chill  were not used.  

As important as it is to initiate freezing in the appropriate regions of the cavity, it  is also important to avoid premature solidiﬁ  cation in sections of the mold nearest the  riser. Of particular concern is the passageway between the riser and the main cavity.  This connection must be designed in such a way that it does not freeze before the  casting, which would isolate the casting from the molten metal in the riser. Although  it is generally desirable to minimize the volume in the connection (to reduce wasted  metal), the cross-sectional area must be sufﬁ  cient to delay the onset of freezing. This  goal is usually aided by making the passageway short in length, so that it absorbs  heat from the molten metal in the riser and the casting.  

# 10.3.5  RISER DESIGN  

As described earlier, a riser, Figure 10.2(b), is used in a sand-casting mold to feed  liquid metal to the casting during freezing in order to compensate for solidiﬁ  cation  shrinkage.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec11.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec11.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec10.txt","0.8047350358505049, 0.800958954917976, 0.8009268160317717"

cooling and achieving chemical durability of the final product. Modern window glass  and the techniques for making it have required slight adjustments in composition  and closer control over its variation. Magnesia  $\mathrm{(MgO)}$ ) has been added to help re- duce  devitrification.  

Containers  In previous times, the same basic soda-lime composition was used for  manual glass-blowing to make bottles and other containers. Modern processes for  shaping glass containers cool the glass more rapidly than older methods. Also, the  importance of chemical stability in container glass is better understood today. Re-  sulting changes in composition have attempted to optimize the proportions of lime  (CaO) and soda  $\left(\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$ . Lime promotes fluidity. It also increases devitrification,  but since cooling is more rapid, this effect is not as important as in prior processing  techniques with slower cooling rates. Soda reduces chemical instability and solubil- ity  of the container glass.  

Light Bulb Glass   Glass used in light bulbs and other thin glass items (e.g., drinking  glasses, Christmas ornaments) is high in soda and low in lime; it also contains small  amounts of magnesia and alumina. The chemistry is dictated largely by the econom-  ics of large volumes involved in light bulb manufacture. The raw materials are inex-  pensive and suited to the continuous melting furnaces used today.  

Laboratory Glassware  These products include containers for chemicals (e.g.,  flasks, beakers, glass tubing). The glass must be resistant to chemical attack and ther-  mal shock. Glass that is high in silica is suitable because of its low thermal expan-  sion. The trade name “Vicor” is used for this high-silica glass. This product is very  insoluble in water and acids. Additions of boric oxide also produce a glass with low  coefficient of thermal expansion, so some glass for laboratory ware contains  $\mathrm{B}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$  in  amounts of around  $13\%$ . The trade name “Pyrex” is used for the borosilicate glass   developed by the Corning Glass Works. Both Vicor and Pyrex are included in the  listing as examples of this product category.  

Glass Fibers  Glass fibers are manufactured for a number of important applica- tions,  including fiberglass reinforced plastics, insulation wool, and fiber optics. The  compositions vary according to function. The most commonly used glass reinforcing  fibers in plastics are E-glass. It is high in CaO and ${\mathrm{Al}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$  content, it is economical, and  it possesses good tensile strength in fiber form. Another glass fiber material is S- glass, which has higher strength but is not as economical as E-glass. Compositions are  indicated in the table.  

Insulating fiberglass wool can be manufactured from regular soda-lime-silica  glasses. The glass product for fiber optics consists of a long, continuous core of glass  with high refractive index surrounded by a sheath of lower refractive glass. The in-  side glass must have a very high transmittance for light in order to accomplish long  distance communication.  

Optical Glasses  Applications for these glasses include lenses for eyeglasses and  optical instruments such as cameras, microscopes, and telescopes. To achieve their  function, the glasses must have different refractive indices, but each lens must be  homogenous in composition. Optical glasses are generally divided into: crowns and  flints. Silicon is one of the most abundant  elements in the Earth’s crust, com-  prising about $26\%$  by weight  (Table 7.1). It occurs naturally only as a chemical com-  pound—in  rocks, sand, clay, and soil—either as silicon dioxide or as more  complex silicate compounds. As an element it has the same  crystalline structure as diamond, but its hardness is lower. It is  hard but brittle, lightweight, chemically inactive at room  temperature, and is classified as a semiconductor.  

The greatest amounts of silicon in manufacturing are in ceramic  compounds ( $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   in glass and silicates in clays) and alloying  elements in steel, aluminum, and copper alloys. It is also used  as a reducing agent in certain metallurgical processes. Of sig-  nificant technological importance is pure silicon as the base  material in semiconduc-  tor manufacturing in electronics. The  vast majority of integrated circuits produced today are made  from silicon (Chapter 33).  

# 7.5.3  BORON  

Boron is a semimetallic element in the same periodic group as  aluminum. It is only about  $0.001\%$  of the Earth’s crust by  weight, commonly occurring as the miner- als  borax  $\mathrm{(Na_{2}B_{4}O_{7^{-}}}$ $10\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ ) and  kernite  $(\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{B}_{4}\mathrm{O}_{7}\mathrm{-}4\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O})$ . Boron is lightweight and  very stiff (high modulus of elasticity) in fiber form. In terms of  electrical properties, it is classified as a semiconductor (its  conductivity varies with temperature; it is an insulator at low  temperatures but a conductor at high temperatures).  

As a material of industrial significance, boron is usually found  in compound form.  As such, it is used as a solution in nickel  electroplating operations, an ingredient  $\left(\mathrm{B}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$  in certain glass  compositions, a catalyst in organic chemical reactions, and as  a  nitride (cubic boron nitride) for cutting tools. In nearly pure  form it is used as a fiber in composite materials (Sections 9.4.1  and 14.1). The potassium blend, for example, has the  chemical composition $\mathrm{KAlSi}_{3}\mathrm{O}_{8}$ . Mixtures of clay, silica, and feldspar are used to make  stoneware, china, and other tableware.  

Still another important raw material for traditional ceramics is  alumina . Most  alumina is processed from the mineral  bauxite , which is an impure mixture of hy-  drous aluminum oxide and aluminum hydroxide plus similar compounds of iron or  manganese. Bauxite is also the principal ore in the production of aluminum metal.  A purer but less common form of ${\mathrm{Al}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$  is the mineral  corundum , which contains  alumina in massive amounts. Slightly impure forms of corundum crystals are the  colored gemstones sapphire and ruby. Alumina ceramic is used as an abrasive in  grinding wheels and as a refractory brick in furnaces.  

Silicon carbide , also used as an abrasive, does not occur as a mineral. Instead,  it is produced by heating mixtures of sand (source of silicon) and coke (carbon) to  a temperature of around  $2200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(3900^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ), so that the resulting chemical reaction  forms SiC and carbon monoxide.  

# 7.2.2  TRADITIONAL   CERAMIC   PRODUCTS  

The minerals discussed above are the ingredients for a variety of ceramic products.  The coverage is organized by major categories of traditional ceramic products. A  summary of these products, and the raw materials and ceramics out of which they  are made, is presented in Table 7.3. The coverage is limited to materials commonly  used in manufactured products, thus omitting certain commercially important ce-  ramics such as cement.  

Pottery and Tableware  This category is one of the oldest, dating back thousands  of years; yet it is still one of the most important. It includes tableware products that  we all use: earthenware, stoneware, and china. The raw materials for these products  are clay usually combined with other minerals such as silica and feldspar. The wetted  mixture is shaped and then fired to produce the finished piece.  

Earthenware  is the least refined of the group; it includes pottery and similar ar-  ticles made in ancient times. Earthenware is relatively porous and is often glazed.  Glazing  involves application of a surface coating, usually a mixture of oxides such

as silica and alumina, to make the product less pervious to moisture and more at-  tractive to the eye.  Stoneware  has lower porosity than earthenware, resulting from  closer control of ingredients and higher firing temperatures.  China  is fired at even  higher temperatures, which produces the translucence in the finished pieces that  characterize their fine quality. The reason for this is that much of the ceramic mate-  rial has been converted to the glassy (vitrified) phase, which is relatively transparent  compared to the polycrystalline form. Modern  porcelain  is nearly the same as china  and is produced by firing the components, mainly clay, silica, and feldspar, at still  higher temperatures to achieve a very hard, dense, glassy material. Porcelain is used in  a variety of products ranging from electrical insulation to bathtub coatings.  

Brick and Tile   Building brick, clay pipe, unglazed roof tile, and drain tile are made  from  various low-cost clays containing silica and gritty matter widely available in  natural  deposits. These products are shaped by pressing (molding) and firing at rela-  tively low  temperatures.  

Refractories  Refractory ceramics, often in the form of bricks, are critical in many  industrial processes that require furnaces and crucibles to heat and/or melt materi-  als. The useful properties of refractory materials are high temperature resistance,  thermal insulation, and resistance to chemical reaction with the materials (usually  molten metals) being heated. As mentioned, alumina is often used as a refractory  ceramic, together with silica.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/Sec7.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/Sec7.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/Sec7.txt","0.820096595836747, 0.811373543833589, 0.8086217203395613"

As soon as the molten metal is in the mold, it begins to cool. When the tem- perature drops sufﬁ  ciently (e.g., to the freezing point for a pure metal), solidiﬁ  cation  begins. Solidiﬁ  cation involves a change of phase of the metal. Time is required to  complete the phase change, and considerable heat is given up in the process. It is  during this step in the process that the metal assumes the solid shape of the mold  cavity and many of the properties and characteristics of the casting are established.  

Once the casting has cooled sufﬁ  ciently, it is removed from the mold. Depending  on the casting method and metal used, further processing may be required. This

may include trimming any excess metal from the actual cast part, cleaning the sur- face, inspecting the product, and heat treatment to enhance properties. In addition,  machining may be required to achieve closer tolerances on certain part features and  to remove the cast surface.  

Casting processes divide into two broad categories, according to type of mold  used: expendable mold casting and permanent mold casting. An  expendable mold means that the mold in which the molten metal solidiﬁ  es must be destroyed in order  to remove the casting. These molds are made out of sand, plaster, or similar materi- als, whose form is maintained by using binders of various kinds. Sand casting is the  most prominent example of the expendable mold processes. In sand casting, the  liquid metal is poured into a mold made of sand. After the metal hardens, the mold  must be sacriﬁ  ced in order to recover the casting.  

A  permanent mold  is one that can be used over and over to produce many cast- ings. It is made of metal (or, less commonly, a ceramic refractory material) that  can withstand the high temperatures of the casting operation. In permanent mold  casting, the mold consists of two (or more) sections that can be opened to permit  removal of the ﬁ  nished part. Die casting is the most familiar process in this group.  

More intricate casting geometries are generally possible with the expendable  mold processes. Part shapes in the permanent mold processes are limited by the  need to open the mold. On the other hand, some of the permanent mold processes  have certain economic advantages in high production operations. The expendable  mold and permanent mold casting processes are described in Chapter 11.  

# 10.1.2  SAND-CASTING MOLDS  

Sand casting is by far the most important casting process. A sand-casting mold will  be used to describe the basic features of a mold. Many of these features and terms  are common to the molds used in other casting processes. Figure 10.2(b) shows the  cross-sectional view of a typical sand-casting mold, indicating some of the terminol- ogy. The mold consists of two halves: cope and drag. The  cope  is the upper half of the  mold, and the  drag  is the bottom half. These two mold parts are contained in a box,  called a  ﬂ  ask , which is also divided into two halves, one for the cope and the other  for the drag. The two halves of the mold separate at the  parting line .  

In sand casting (and other expendable mold processes) the mold cavity is formed  by means of a  pattern , which is made of wood, metal, plastic, or other material and  has the shape of the part to be cast. The cavity is formed by packing sand around the  pattern, about half each in the cope and drag, so that when the pattern is removed,  the remaining void has the desired shape of the cast part. The pattern is usually  made oversized to allow for shrinkage of the metal as it solidiﬁ  es and cools. The sand  for the mold is moist and contains a binder to maintain its shape. In addition, various machines have  been developed to mechanize the packing procedure. These machines operate by  any of several mechanisms, including (1) squeezing the sand around the pattern  by pneumatic pressure; (2) a jolting action in which the sand, contained in the  ﬂ  ask with the pattern, is dropped repeatedly in order to pack it into place; and  (3) a slinging action, in which the sand grains are impacted against the pattern at  high speed.  

An alternative to traditional ﬂ  asks for each sand mold is  ﬂ  askless molding , which  refers to the use of one master ﬂ  ask in a mechanized system of mold production.  Each sand mold is produced using the same master ﬂ  ask. Mold production rates up  to 600 per hour are claimed for this more automated method [8].  

Several indicators are used to determine the quality of the sand mold [7]:  (1)  strength —the mold’s ability to maintain its shape and resist erosion caused by  the ﬂ  ow of molten metal; it depends on grain shape, adhesive qualities of the binder,  and other factors; (2)  permeability —capacity of the mold to allow hot air and  gases from the casting operation to pass through the voids in the sand; (3)  thermal  stability —ability of the sand at the surface of the mold cavity to resist cracking  and buckling upon contact with the molten metal; (4)  collapsibility —ability of  the mold to give way and allow the casting to shrink without cracking the casting;  it also refers to the ability to remove the sand from the casting during cleaning;  and (5)  reusability —can the sand from the broken mold be reused to make other  molds? These measures are sometimes incompatible; for example, a mold with  greater strength is less collapsible.  

Sand molds are often classiﬁ  ed as green-sand, dry-sand, or skin-dried molds.  Green-sand molds  are made of a mixture of sand, clay, and water, the word  green   referring to the fact that the mold contains moisture at the time of pouring. Green- sand molds possess sufﬁ  cient strength for most applications, good collapsibility,  good permeability, good reusability, and are the least expensive of the molds. They  are the most widely used mold type, but they are not without problems. Moisture in  the sand can cause defects in some castings, depending on the metal and geometry  of the part. A  dry-sand mold  is made using organic binders rather than clay, and the  mold is baked in a large oven at temperatures ranging from $200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to $320^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ( $(400^{\circ}\mathrm{F}-$ $600^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ ) [8]. Oven baking strengthens the mold and hardens the cavity surface. A  dry-sand mold provides better dimensional control in the cast product, compared  to green-sand molding. However, dry-sand molding is more expensive, and produc- tion rate is reduced because of drying time. Applications are generally limited to  medium and large castings in low to medium production rates. In a  skin-dried mold ,  the advantages of a dry-sand mold is partially achieved by drying the surface of a  green-sand mold to a depth of 10 to  $25~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.4–1 in) at the mold cavity surface,  using torches, heating lamps, or other means. Special bonding materials must be  added to the sand mixture to strengthen the cavity surface.  

The preceding mold classiﬁ  cations refer to the use of conventional binders con- sisting of either clay-and-water or ones that require heating to cure. In addition to  these classiﬁ  cations, chemically bonded molds have been developed that are not  based on either of these traditional binder ingredients. Some of the binder materials

Source: [7]. a Density depends on composition of alloy; value given is typical. These two mold parts are contained in a box,  called a  ﬂ  ask , which is also divided into two halves, one for the cope and the other  for the drag. The two halves of the mold separate at the  parting line .  

In sand casting (and other expendable mold processes) the mold cavity is formed  by means of a  pattern , which is made of wood, metal, plastic, or other material and  has the shape of the part to be cast. The cavity is formed by packing sand around the  pattern, about half each in the cope and drag, so that when the pattern is removed,  the remaining void has the desired shape of the cast part. The pattern is usually  made oversized to allow for shrinkage of the metal as it solidiﬁ  es and cools. The sand  for the mold is moist and contains a binder to maintain its shape.  

The cavity in the mold provides the external surfaces of the cast part. In addition,  a casting may have internal surfaces. These surfaces are determined by means of a  core , a form placed inside the mold cavity to deﬁ  ne the interior geometry of the part.  In sand casting, cores are generally made of sand, although other materials can be  used, such as metals, plaster, and ceramics.  

The  gating system  in a casting mold is the channel, or network of channels, by  which molten metal ﬂ  ows into the cavity from outside the mold. As shown in the ﬁ  g- ure, the gating system typically consists of a  downsprue  (also called simply the  sprue ),  through which the metal enters a  runner  that leads into the main cavity. At the top of  the downsprue, a  pouring cup  is often used to minimize splash and turbulence as the  metal ﬂ  ows into the downsprue. It is shown in the diagram as a simple cone-shaped  funnel. Some pouring cups are designed in the shape of a bowl, with an open channel  leading to the downsprue.  

In addition to the gating system, any casting in which shrinkage is signiﬁ  cant  requires a riser connected to the main cavity. The  riser  is a reservoir in the mold that  serves as a source of liquid metal for the casting to compensate for shrinkage during  solidiﬁ  cation. The riser must be designed to freeze after the main casting in order to  satisfy its function.  

As the metal ﬂ  ows into the mold, the air that previously occupied the cavity, as  well as hot gases formed by reactions of the molten metal, must be evacuated so that  the metal will completely ﬁ  ll the empty space. In sand casting, for example, the natu- ral porosity of the sand mold permits the air and gases to escape through the walls  of the cavity. In permanent metal molds, small vent holes are drilled into the mold or  machined into the parting line to permit removal of air and gases.  

#  Heating and Pouring  

To perform a casting operation, the metal must be heated to a temperature some- what above its melting point and then poured into the mold cavity to solidify. Several  aspects of these two steps are discussed in this section.  

# 10.2.1  HEATING THE METAL  

Heating furnaces of various kinds (Section 11.4.1) are used to heat the metal to a  molten temperature sufﬁ  cient for casting. The heat energy required is the sum of (1)  the heat to raise the temperature to the melting point, (2) the heat of fusion to con- vert it from solid to liquid, and (3) the heat to raise the molten metal to the desired  temperature for pouring.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec10.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec11.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec10.txt","0.7856893812909908, 0.7825973877259655, 0.7799454793748539"

Following solidiﬁ  cation and cooling, the sand mold is broken away from the casting  to retrieve the part. The part is then cleaned—gating and riser system are separated,  and sand is removed. The casting is then inspected (Section 11.5).  

#  Other Expendable-Mold Casting Processes  

As versatile as sand casting is, there are other casting processes that have been  developed to meet special needs. The differences between these methods are in the  composition of the mold material, or the manner in which the mold is made, or in  the way the pattern is made.  

# 11.2.1  SHELL MOLDING  

Shell molding is a casting process in which the mold is a thin shell (typically 9 mm  or 3/8 in) made of sand held together by a thermosetting resin binder. Developed in  Germany during the early 1940s, the process is described and illustrated in Figure 11.5.  

There are many advantages to the shell-molding process. The surface of the  shell-mold cavity is smoother than a conventional green-sand mold, and this  smoothness permits easier ﬂ  ow of molten metal during pouring and better surface  ﬁ  nish on the ﬁ  nal casting. Finishes of  $2.5\ \mu\mathrm{m}$  ( $100~\mu$ -in) can be obtained. Good

FIGURE 11.5  Steps in shell-molding: (1) a match-plate or cope-and-drag metal pattern is heated and placed over a  box containing sand mixed with thermosetting resin; (2) box is inverted so that sand and resin fall onto the hot pattern,  causing a layer of the mixture to partially cure on the surface to form a hard shell; (3) box is repositioned so that loose,  uncured particles drop away; (4) sand shell is heated in oven for several minutes to complete curing; (5) shell mold is  stripped from the pattern; (6) two halves of the shell mold are assembled, supported by sand or metal shot in a box,  and pouring is accomplished. The ﬁ  nished casting with sprue removed is shown in (7).  

dimensional accuracy is also achieved, with tolerances of  $\pm0.25~\mathrm{mm}$  ( $(\pm0.010\$  in)  possible on small-to-medium-sized parts. The good ﬁ  nish and accuracy often pre- cludes the need for further machining. Collapsibility of the mold is generally suf- ﬁ  cient to avoid tearing and cracking of the casting.  

Disadvantages of shell molding include a more expensive metal pattern than the  corresponding pattern for green-sand molding. This makes shell molding difﬁ  cult to  justify for small quantities of parts. Shell molding can be mechanized for mass pro- duction and is very economical for large quantities. It seems particularly suited to  steel castings of less than 20 lb. Examples of parts made using shell molding include  gears, valve bodies, bushings, and camshafts.  

# 11.2.2  VACUUM MOLDING  

Vacuum molding, also called the  V-process , was developed in Japan around 1970. It  uses a sand mold held together by vacuum pressure rather than by a chemical binder.  Accordingly, the term  vacuum  in this process refers to the making of the mold rather  than the casting operation itself. The steps of the process are explained in Figure 11.6.  

! Special bonding materials must be  added to the sand mixture to strengthen the cavity surface.  

The preceding mold classiﬁ  cations refer to the use of conventional binders con- sisting of either clay-and-water or ones that require heating to cure. In addition to  these classiﬁ  cations, chemically bonded molds have been developed that are not  based on either of these traditional binder ingredients. Some of the binder materials

used in these “no-bake” systems include furan resins (consisting of furfural alcohol,  urea, and formaldehyde), phenolics, and alkyd oils. No-bake molds are growing in  popularity due to their good dimensional control in high production applications.  

# 11.1.3 THE CASTING OPERATION  

After the core is positioned (if one is used) and the two halves of the mold are  clamped together, then casting is performed. Casting consists of pouring, solidiﬁ  ca- tion, and cooling of the cast part (Sections 10.2 and 10.3). The gating and riser system  in the mold must be designed to deliver liquid metal into the cavity and provide for  a sufﬁ  cient reservoir of molten metal during solidiﬁ  cation shrinkage. Air and gases  must be allowed to escape.  

One of the hazards during pouring is that the buoyancy of the molten metal will  displace the core. Buoyancy results from the weight of molten metal being displaced  by the core, according to Archimedes’ principle. The force tending to lift the core is  equal to the weight of the displaced liquid less the weight of the core itself. Expressing  the situation in equation form,  

$$
F_{b}=W_{m}-W_{c}
$$  

where $F_{b}=$  buoyancy force,  $\mathbf{N}$  (lb);  $W_{m}=$  weight of molten metal displaced, N (lb);  and $\%$ $W_{c}=$  weight of the core, $\mathbf{N}$  (lb). Weights are determined as the volume of the  core multiplied by the respective densities of the core material (typically sand) and the  metal being cast. The density of a sand core is approximately  $1.6~\mathrm{g/cm}^{3}$   $(0.058\,\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{in}^{3})$ .  Densities of several common casting alloys are given in Table 11.1.  

A sand core has a volume $=1875\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$  and is located inside a sand mold cavity.  Determine the buoyancy force tending to lift the core during pouring of mol- ten lead into the mold.  

Solution:  Density of the sand core is $1.6\;\mathrm{g/cm}^{3}$ . Weight of the core is  $1875(1.6)=$ $3000\:\mathrm{g}=3.0\:\mathrm{kg}$ . Density of lead, based on Table 11.1, is  $11.3\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . The weight of  lead displaced by the core is $1875(11.3)=21{,}188\:\mathrm{g}=21{.}19\:\mathrm{kg}.$ . The difference $=$ $21.19-3.0=18.19\,\mathrm{kg}$ . Given that $1\,\mathrm{kg}=9.81\,\mathrm{N}$ , the buoyancy force is therefore  $F_{b}=9.81(18.19)=\mathbf{178.4}\,\mathbf{N}$ .  

Following solidiﬁ  cation and cooling, the sand mold is broken away from the casting  to retrieve the part. The part is then cleaned—gating and riser system are separated,  and sand is removed. The casting is then inspected (Section 11.5).  

#  Other Expendable-Mold Casting Processes  

As versatile as sand casting is, there are other casting processes that have been  developed to meet special needs. The densities of most molten metals are much higher than water and other ﬂ  uids  normally encountered. These molten metals are also much more chemically reac- tive than at room temperature. Consequently, the wear caused by the ﬂ  ow of these  metals in the mold is signiﬁ  cant, especially under turbulent conditions. Erosion is  especially serious when it occurs in the main cavity because the geometry of the  cast part is affected.  

# 10.2.3  ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF POURING  

There are several relationships that govern the ﬂ  ow of liquid metal through  the gating system and into the mold. An important relationship is  Bernoulli’s  theorem , which states that the sum of the energies (head, pressure, kinetic, and  friction) at any two points in a ﬂ  owing liquid are equal. This can be written in the  following form:  

$$
h_{1}+\frac{p_{1}}{\rho}+\frac{\nu_{1}^{2}}{2g}+F_{1}=h_{2}+\frac{p^{2}}{\rho}+\frac{\nu_{2}^{2}}{2g}+F_{2}
$$  

where $h=$  head, cm (in), $p=$  pressure on the liquid, $\mathrm{N}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}\,(\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{in}^{2});\rho=\mathrm{density},\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ $\mathrm{(l bm/in}^{3})$ ;  $\nu~=$  ﬂ  ow velocity, cm/s (in/sec);  $g\,=$ gravitational acceleration constant,  $981\;\mathrm{cm/s/s}$ $\mathrm{s/s}\;(32.2\times12=386\;\mathrm{in/sec/sec})$ ; and $F=$  head losses due to friction, cm (in).  Subscripts 1 and 2 indicate any two locations in the liquid ﬂ  ow.  

Bernoulli’s equation can be simpliﬁ  ed in several ways. If friction losses are ignored  (to be sure, friction will affect the liquid ﬂ  ow through a sand mold), and the system  is assumed to remain at atmospheric pressure throughout, then the equation can be  reduced to  

$$
h_{1}+\frac{\nu_{1}^{2}}{2g}=h_{2}+\frac{\nu_{2}^{2}}{2g}
$$  

This can be used to determine the velocity of the molten metal at the base of the  sprue. Let point 1 be deﬁ  ned at the top of the sprue and point 2 at its base. If point  2 is used as the reference plane, then the head at that point is zero ( $(h_{2}=0)$ ) and  $h_{1}$   is the height (length) of the sprue. When the metal is poured into the pouring cup  and overﬂ  ows down the sprue, its initial velocity at the top is zero ( $\left(\nu_{1}=0\right)$ ). Hence,  Equation (10.3) further simpliﬁ  es to  

$$
h_{1}=\frac{\nu_{2}^{2}}{2g}
$$  

which can be solved for the ﬂ  ow velocity:  

$$
\nu=\sqrt{2g h}
$$  

where  $\nu\,=$  the velocity of the liquid metal at the base of the sprue, $\mathrm{{cm}/\mathrm{{s}}}$  (in/sec);  $g=981\ \mathrm{cm/s/s}\ (386\ \mathrm{in/sec/sec});$ ; and $h=$  the height of the sprue, cm (in).  

Another relationship of importance during pouring is the  continuity law , which  states that the volume rate of ﬂ  ow remains constant throughout the liquid. The vol- ume ﬂ  ow rate is equal to the velocity multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the  ﬂ  owing liquid.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec11.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec11.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec10.txt","0.8258081341668166, 0.8058969070291955, 0.8026090753346924"

As soon as the molten metal is in the mold, it begins to cool. When the tem- perature drops sufﬁ  ciently (e.g., to the freezing point for a pure metal), solidiﬁ  cation  begins. Solidiﬁ  cation involves a change of phase of the metal. Time is required to  complete the phase change, and considerable heat is given up in the process. It is  during this step in the process that the metal assumes the solid shape of the mold  cavity and many of the properties and characteristics of the casting are established.  

Once the casting has cooled sufﬁ  ciently, it is removed from the mold. Depending  on the casting method and metal used, further processing may be required. This

may include trimming any excess metal from the actual cast part, cleaning the sur- face, inspecting the product, and heat treatment to enhance properties. In addition,  machining may be required to achieve closer tolerances on certain part features and  to remove the cast surface.  

Casting processes divide into two broad categories, according to type of mold  used: expendable mold casting and permanent mold casting. An  expendable mold means that the mold in which the molten metal solidiﬁ  es must be destroyed in order  to remove the casting. These molds are made out of sand, plaster, or similar materi- als, whose form is maintained by using binders of various kinds. Sand casting is the  most prominent example of the expendable mold processes. In sand casting, the  liquid metal is poured into a mold made of sand. After the metal hardens, the mold  must be sacriﬁ  ced in order to recover the casting.  

A  permanent mold  is one that can be used over and over to produce many cast- ings. It is made of metal (or, less commonly, a ceramic refractory material) that  can withstand the high temperatures of the casting operation. In permanent mold  casting, the mold consists of two (or more) sections that can be opened to permit  removal of the ﬁ  nished part. Die casting is the most familiar process in this group.  

More intricate casting geometries are generally possible with the expendable  mold processes. Part shapes in the permanent mold processes are limited by the  need to open the mold. On the other hand, some of the permanent mold processes  have certain economic advantages in high production operations. The expendable  mold and permanent mold casting processes are described in Chapter 11.  

# 10.1.2  SAND-CASTING MOLDS  

Sand casting is by far the most important casting process. A sand-casting mold will  be used to describe the basic features of a mold. Many of these features and terms  are common to the molds used in other casting processes. Figure 10.2(b) shows the  cross-sectional view of a typical sand-casting mold, indicating some of the terminol- ogy. The mold consists of two halves: cope and drag. The  cope  is the upper half of the  mold, and the  drag  is the bottom half. These two mold parts are contained in a box,  called a  ﬂ  ask , which is also divided into two halves, one for the cope and the other  for the drag. The two halves of the mold separate at the  parting line .  

In sand casting (and other expendable mold processes) the mold cavity is formed  by means of a  pattern , which is made of wood, metal, plastic, or other material and  has the shape of the part to be cast. The cavity is formed by packing sand around the  pattern, about half each in the cope and drag, so that when the pattern is removed,  the remaining void has the desired shape of the cast part. The pattern is usually  made oversized to allow for shrinkage of the metal as it solidiﬁ  es and cools. The sand  for the mold is moist and contains a binder to maintain its shape. # Metal Casting  Processes

11.7 Product Design Considerations  

Metal casting processes divide into two categories, based  on mold type: (1) expendable mold and (2) permanent  mold. In expendable mold casting operations, the mold  is sacriﬁ  ced in order to remove the cast part. Since a new  mold is required for each new casting, production rates  in expendable-mold processes are often limited by the  time required to make the mold rather than the time  to make the casting itself. However, for certain part  geometries, sand molds can be produced and castings  made at rates of 400 parts per hour and higher. In per- manent mold casting processes, the mold is fabricated  out of metal (or other durable material) and can be used  many times to make many castings. Accordingly, these  processes possess a natural advantage in terms of higher  production rates.  

The discussion of casting processes in this chapter  is organized as follows: (1) sand casting, (2) other ex- pendable mold casting processes, and (3) permanent  mold casting processes. The chapter also includes cast- ing equipment and practices used in foundries. Another  section deals with inspection and quality issues. Product  design guidelines are presented in the ﬁ  nal section.

#  Sand Casting  

Sand casting is the most widely used casting process, ac- counting for a signiﬁ  cant majority of the total tonnage  cast. Nearly all casting alloys can be sand cast; indeed, it  is one of the few processes that can be used for metals  with high melting temperatures, such as steels, nickels,  and titaniums. Its versatility permits the casting of parts  ranging in size from small to very large and in produc- tion quantities from one to millions. Figure 11.1 shows a  cast iron sand casting of a pump housing that has been  partially machined to create accurate holes and surfaces.  

Sand casting , also known as  sand-mold casting , con- sists of pouring molten metal into a sand mold, allowing  the metal to solidify, and then breaking up the mold to  remove the casting. The casting must then be cleaned  and inspected, and heat treatment is sometimes required

to improve metallurgical properties. The cavity in the sand mold is formed by pack- ing sand around a pattern (an approximate duplicate of the part to be cast), and then  removing the pattern by separating the mold into two halves. The mold also contains  the gating and riser system. In addition, if the casting is to have internal surfaces (e.g.,  hollow parts or parts with holes), a core must be included in the mold. Since the mold  is sacriﬁ  ced to remove the casting, a new sand mold must be made for each part that  is produced. From this brief description, sand casting is seen to include not only the  casting operation itself, but also the fabrication of the pattern and the making of the  mold. The production sequence is outlined in Figure 11.2. To a lesser degree, other expendable mold processes are also sus- ceptible to these problems. Defects found primarily in sand castings are shown in  Figure 11.25 and described here:  

![](images/2ab4623342c3ec88da17eeafb3b611b74379e3829dc5640407d44c796390da6c.jpg)  
FIGURE 11.25  Common defects in  sand castings: (a) sand  blow, (b) pin holes, (c)  sand wash, (d) scabs,  (e) penetration, (f) mold  shift, (g) core shift, and  (h) mold crack.  

(a)  Sand blow  is a defect consisting of a balloon-shaped gas cavity caused by  release of mold gases during pouring. It occurs at or below the casting surface  near the top of the casting. Low permeability, poor venting, and high moisture  content of the sand mold are the usual causes.

 (b)  Pinholes ,   also caused by release of gases during pouring, consist of many small  gas cavities formed at or slightly below the surface of the casting.

 (c)  Sand wash ,   which is an irregularity in the surface of the casting that results  from erosion of the sand mold during pouring, and the contour of the erosion is  formed in the surface of the ﬁ  nal cast part.

 (d)  Scabs  are rough areas on the surface of the casting due to encrustations of sand  and metal. It is caused by portions of the mold surface ﬂ  aking off during solidi- ﬁ  cation and becoming imbedded in the casting surface.

 (e)  Penetration  refers to a surface defect that occurs when the ﬂ  uidity of the liquid  metal is high, and it penetrates into the sand mold or sand core. Upon freezing,  the casting surface consists of a mixture of sand grains and metal. Harder pack- ing of the sand mold helps to alleviate this condition.

 (f)  Mold shift  refers to a defect caused by a sidewise displacement of the mold  cope relative to the drag, the result of which is a step in the cast product at the  parting line.

 (g)  Core shift  is similar to mold shift, but it is the core that is displaced, and the dis- placement is usually vertical. Core shift and mold shift are caused by buoyancy  of the molten metal (Section 11.1.3).

 (h)  Mold crack  occurs when mold strength is insufﬁ  cient, and a crack develops, into  which liquid metal can seep to form a “ﬁ  n” on the ﬁ  nal casting.  

Inspection Methods   Foundry inspection procedures include (1) visual inspection  to detect obvious defects such as misruns, cold shuts, and severe surface ﬂ  aws; (2)  dimensional measurements to ensure that tolerances have been met; and (3) metal- lurgical, chemical, physical, and other tests concerned with the inherent quality of  the cast metal [7]. Tests in category (3) include: (a) pressure testing—to locate leaks  in the casting; (b) radiographic methods, magnetic particle tests, the use of ﬂ  uores- cent penetrants, and supersonic testing—to detect either surface or internal defects  in the casting; and (c) mechanical testing to determine properties such as tensile  strength and hardness. If defects are discovered but are not too serious, it is often  possible to save the casting by welding, grinding, or other salvage methods to which  the customer has agreed.  

Most commercial castings are made of alloys rather than pure metals. Alloys are  generally easier to cast, and properties of the resulting product are better. Casting  alloys can be classiﬁ  ed as ferrous or nonferrous. The ferrous category is subdivided  into cast iron and cast steel.  

Ferrous Casting Alloys: Cast Iron   Cast iron is the most important of all cast- ing alloys (Historical Note 11.3). The tonnage of cast iron castings is several times  that of all other metals combined. There are several types of cast iron: (1) gray  cast iron, (2) nodular iron, (3) white cast iron, (4) malleable iron, and (5) alloy cast  irons (Section 6.2.4).","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec10.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec11.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec11.txt","0.8641309744641678, 0.8587882606934585, 0.8515955297431769"

The pattern  is normally coated with a refractory compound to provide a smoother surface on  the pattern and to improve its high temperature resistance. Molding sands usually  include bonding agents. However, dry sand is used in certain processes in this group,  which aids recovery and reuse.  

A signiﬁ  cant advantage for this process is that the pattern need not be removed  from the mold. This simpliﬁ  es and expedites mold making.

are built into the pattern itself. A new pattern is needed for every casting, so the  economics of the expanded polystyrene casting process depend largely on the cost  of producing the patterns. The process has been applied to mass produce castings  for automobiles engines. Automated production systems are installed to mold the  polystyrene foam patterns for these applications. Figure 11.8 shows an aluminum  engine head that was cast by the expanded polystyrene process (the holes and some  surfaces have been machined).  

# 11.2.4  INVESTMENT CASTING  

In investment casting, a pattern made of wax is coated with a refractory material  to make the mold, after which the wax is melted away prior to pouring the molten  metal. The term  investment  comes from one of the less familiar deﬁ  nitions of the  word  invest , which is “to cover completely,” this referring to the coating of the re- fractory material around the wax pattern. It is a precision casting process, because  it is capable of making castings of high accuracy and intricate detail. The process  dates back to ancient Egypt (Historical Note 11.1) and is also known as the  lost-wax  process , because the wax pattern is lost from the mold prior to casting.  

# Historical Note 11.1  Investment casting  

The lost wax casting process was developed by the  ancient Egyptians some 3,500 years ago. Although  written records do not identify when the invention  occurred or the artisan responsible, historians specu- late that the process resulted from the close associa- tion between pottery and molding in early times. It  was the potter who crafted the molds that were used  for casting. The idea for the lost wax process must  have originated with a potter who was familiar with  the casting process. As he was working one day on  a ceramic piece—perhaps an ornate vase or bowl—it  occurred to him that the article might be more attrac- tive and durable if made of metal. So he fashioned a  core in the general shape of the piece, but smaller  than the desired ﬁ  nal dimensions, and coated it with  wax to establish the size. The wax proved to be  an easy material to form, and intricate designs and  shapes could be created by the craftsman. On the  wax surface, he carefully plastered several layers of  clay and devised a means of holding the resulting  

components together. It  was the potter who crafted the molds that were used  for casting.

On the  wax surface, he carefully plastered several layers of  clay and devised a means of holding the resulting  

components together. He then baked the mold in a  kiln, so that the clay hardened and the wax melted  and drained out to form a cavity. At last, he poured  molten bronze into the cavity and, after the cast- ing had solidiﬁ  ed and cooled, broke away the mold  to recover the part. Considering the education and  experience of this early pottery maker and the tools  he had to work with, development of the lost wax  casting process demonstrated great innovation and  insight. “No other process can be named by archeol- ogists so crowded with deduction, engineering ability  and ingenuity” [14].  

Steps in investment casting are described in Figure 11.9. Since the wax pattern is  melted off after the refractory mold is made, a separate pattern must be made for  every casting. Pattern production is usually accomplished by a molding operation— pouring or injecting the hot wax into a  master die  that has been designed with proper  allowances for shrinkage of both wax and subsequent metal casting. In cases where the  part geometry is complicated, several separate wax pieces must be joined to make the  pattern. In high-production operations, several patterns are attached to a sprue, also  made of wax, to form a  pattern tree ; this is the geometry that will be cast out of metal.

Parts are separated from the sprue.

Coating with refractory (step 3) is usually accomplished by dipping the pattern  tree into a slurry of very ﬁ  ne grained silica or other refractory (almost in powder  form) mixed with plaster to bond the mold into shape. The small grain size of the  refractory material provides a smooth surface and captures the intricate details of  the wax pattern. The ﬁ  nal mold (step 4) is accomplished by repeatedly dipping the  tree into the refractory slurry or by gently packing the refractory around the tree in  a container. The mold is allowed to air dry for about 8 hours to harden the binder. (Courtesy of Alcoa Howmet.)

Advantages of investment casting include: (1) parts of great complexity and  intricacy can be cast; (2) close dimensional control—tolerances of  $\pm0.075\ \mathrm{mm}$ $(\pm0.003\;\mathrm{in})$  are possible; (3) good surface ﬁ  nish is possible; (4) the wax can usually  be recovered for reuse; and (5) additional machining is not normally required— this is a net shape process. Because many steps are involved in this casting opera- tion, it is a relatively expensive process. Investment castings are normally small in  size, although parts with complex geometries weighing up to  $75\,\mathrm{lb}$  have been suc- cessfully cast. All types of metals, including steels, stainless steels, and other high  temperature alloys, can be investment cast. Examples of parts include complex  machinery parts, blades, and other components for turbine engines, jewelry, and  dental ﬁ  xtures. Shown in Figure 11.10 is a part illustrating the intricate features  possible with investment casting.  

# 11.2.5 PLASTER-MOLD AND CERAMIC-MOLD CASTING  

Plaster-mold casting is similar to sand casting except that the mold is made of plas- ter of Paris (gypsum $\mathrm{-CaSO_{4}}\mathrm{-}2\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O})$  instead of sand. Additives such as talc and  silica ﬂ  our are mixed with the plaster to control contraction and setting time, reduce  cracking, and increase strength. To make the mold, the plaster mixture combined with  water is poured over a plastic or metal pattern in a ﬂ  ask and allowed to set. Wood  patterns are generally unsatisfactory due to the extended contact with water in the  plaster. The ﬂ  uid consistency permits the plaster mixture to readily ﬂ  ow around the  pattern, capturing its details and surface ﬁ  nish. Thus, the cast product in plaster mold- ing is noted for these attributes.  

Curing of the plaster mold is one of the disadvantages of this process, at least  in high production. The mold must set for about 20 minutes before the pattern is  stripped. The mold is then baked for several hours to remove moisture. Even with  the baking, not all of the moisture content is removed from the plaster. The dilem- ma faced by foundrymen is that mold strength is lost when the plaster becomes  too dehydrated, and yet moisture content can cause casting defects in the product.  A balance must be achieved between these undesirable alternatives. Another dis- advantage with the plaster mold is that it is not permeable, thus limiting escape  of gases from the mold cavity. This problem can be solved in a number of ways:  (1) evacuating air from the mold cavity before pouring; (2) aerating the plaster  slurry prior to mold making so that the resulting hard plaster contains ﬁ  nely dis- persed voids; and (3) using a special mold composition and treatment known as  the  Antioch process . This process involves using about $50\%$  sand mixed with the  plaster, heating the mold in an autoclave (an oven that uses superheated steam  under pressure), and then drying. The resulting mold has considerably greater  permeability than a conventional plaster mold.  

Plaster molds cannot withstand the same high temperatures as sand molds. They  are therefore limited to the casting of lower-melting-point alloys, such as alumi- num, magnesium, and some copper-base alloys. Applications include metal molds  for plastic and rubber molding, pump and turbine impellers, and other parts of rela- tively intricate geometry.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec11.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec11.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec11.txt","0.8568830602592524, 0.8443633299798932, 0.8352690298517522"

Applications include metal molds  for plastic and rubber molding, pump and turbine impellers, and other parts of rela- tively intricate geometry. This process involves using about $50\%$  sand mixed with the  plaster, heating the mold in an autoclave (an oven that uses superheated steam  under pressure), and then drying. The resulting mold has considerably greater  permeability than a conventional plaster mold.  

Plaster molds cannot withstand the same high temperatures as sand molds. They  are therefore limited to the casting of lower-melting-point alloys, such as alumi- num, magnesium, and some copper-base alloys. Applications include metal molds  for plastic and rubber molding, pump and turbine impellers, and other parts of rela- tively intricate geometry. Casting sizes range from about  $20~\mathrm{g}$ (less than 1 oz) to  more than  $100~\mathrm{kg}$  (more than 200 lb). Parts weighing less than about  $10~\mathrm{kg}$  (20 lb)  are most common. Advantages of plaster molding for these applications are good  surface ﬁ  nish and dimensional accuracy and the capability to make thin cross sec- tions in the casting.  

Ceramic-mold casting  is similar to plaster-mold casting, except that the mold is  made of refractory ceramic materials that can withstand higher temperatures than  plaster. Thus, ceramic molding can be used to cast steels, cast irons, and other high- temperature alloys. Its applications (relatively intricate parts) are similar to those of  plaster mold casting except for the metals cast. Its advantages (good accuracy and  ﬁ  nish) are also similar.  

#  Permanent-Mold Casting Processes  

The economic disadvantage of any of the expendable mold processes is that a new  mold is required for every casting. In permanent-mold casting, the mold is reused  many times. In this section, permanent-mold casting is treated as the basic process in  the group of casting processes that all use reusable metal molds. Other members of  the group include die casting and centrifugal casting.  

# 11.3.1  THE BASIC PERMANENT-MOLD PROCESS  

Permanent-mold casting uses a metal mold constructed of two sections that are  designed for easy, precise opening and closing. These molds are commonly made of  steel or cast iron. The cavity, with gating system included, is machined into the two  halves to provide accurate dimensions and good surface ﬁ  nish. Metals commonly  cast in permanent molds include aluminum, magnesium, copper-base alloys, and  cast iron. However, cast iron requires a high pouring temperature, $1250^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to  $1500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(2300^{\circ}\mathrm{F}{-}2700^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ , which takes a heavy toll on mold life. The very high pouring tem- peratures of steel make permanent molds unsuitable for this metal, unless the mold  is made of refractory material.  

Cores can be used in permanent molds to form interior surfaces in the cast product.  The cores can be made of metal, but either their shape must allow for removal from  the casting or they must be mechanically collapsible to permit removal. If withdrawal  of a metal core would be difﬁ  cult or impossible, sand cores can be used, in which case  the casting process is often referred to as  semipermanent-mold casting .  

Steps in the basic permanent mold casting process are described in Figure 11.11.  In preparation for casting, the mold is ﬁ  rst preheated and one or more coatings are

sprayed on the cavity. Preheating facilitates metal ﬂ  ow through the gating system  and into the cavity. The coatings aid heat dissipation and lubricate the mold sur- faces for easier separation of the cast product. After pouring, as soon as the metal  solidiﬁ  es, the mold is opened and the casting is removed. Special bonding materials must be  added to the sand mixture to strengthen the cavity surface.  

The preceding mold classiﬁ  cations refer to the use of conventional binders con- sisting of either clay-and-water or ones that require heating to cure. In addition to  these classiﬁ  cations, chemically bonded molds have been developed that are not  based on either of these traditional binder ingredients. Some of the binder materials

used in these “no-bake” systems include furan resins (consisting of furfural alcohol,  urea, and formaldehyde), phenolics, and alkyd oils. No-bake molds are growing in  popularity due to their good dimensional control in high production applications.  

# 11.1.3 THE CASTING OPERATION  

After the core is positioned (if one is used) and the two halves of the mold are  clamped together, then casting is performed. Casting consists of pouring, solidiﬁ  ca- tion, and cooling of the cast part (Sections 10.2 and 10.3). The gating and riser system  in the mold must be designed to deliver liquid metal into the cavity and provide for  a sufﬁ  cient reservoir of molten metal during solidiﬁ  cation shrinkage. Air and gases  must be allowed to escape.  

One of the hazards during pouring is that the buoyancy of the molten metal will  displace the core. Buoyancy results from the weight of molten metal being displaced  by the core, according to Archimedes’ principle. The force tending to lift the core is  equal to the weight of the displaced liquid less the weight of the core itself. Expressing  the situation in equation form,  

$$
F_{b}=W_{m}-W_{c}
$$  

where $F_{b}=$  buoyancy force,  $\mathbf{N}$  (lb);  $W_{m}=$  weight of molten metal displaced, N (lb);  and $\%$ $W_{c}=$  weight of the core, $\mathbf{N}$  (lb). Weights are determined as the volume of the  core multiplied by the respective densities of the core material (typically sand) and the  metal being cast. The density of a sand core is approximately  $1.6~\mathrm{g/cm}^{3}$   $(0.058\,\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{in}^{3})$ .  Densities of several common casting alloys are given in Table 11.1.  

A sand core has a volume $=1875\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$  and is located inside a sand mold cavity.  Determine the buoyancy force tending to lift the core during pouring of mol- ten lead into the mold.  

Solution:  Density of the sand core is $1.6\;\mathrm{g/cm}^{3}$ . Weight of the core is  $1875(1.6)=$ $3000\:\mathrm{g}=3.0\:\mathrm{kg}$ . Density of lead, based on Table 11.1, is  $11.3\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . The weight of  lead displaced by the core is $1875(11.3)=21{,}188\:\mathrm{g}=21{.}19\:\mathrm{kg}.$ . The difference $=$ $21.19-3.0=18.19\,\mathrm{kg}$ . Given that $1\,\mathrm{kg}=9.81\,\mathrm{N}$ , the buoyancy force is therefore  $F_{b}=9.81(18.19)=\mathbf{178.4}\,\mathbf{N}$ .  

Following solidiﬁ  cation and cooling, the sand mold is broken away from the casting  to retrieve the part. The part is then cleaned—gating and riser system are separated,  and sand is removed. The casting is then inspected (Section 11.5).

This part of the book covers those manufacturing  processes in which the starting work material is either  a liquid or is in a highly plastic condition, and a part  is created through solidiﬁ  cation of the material. Cast- ing and molding processes dominate this category of  shaping operations. With reference to Figure 10.1, the  solidiﬁ  cation processes can be classiﬁ  ed according to  the engineering material that is processed: (1) metals,  (2) ceramics, speciﬁ  cally glasses,  and (3) polymers and  polymer matrix composites (PMCs). Casting of metals  is covered in this and the following chapter. Glasswork- ing is covered in Chapter 12, and the processing of poly- mers and PMCs is treated in Chapters 13 and 14.  

Casting  is a process in which molten metal ﬂ  ows by  gravity or other force into a mold where it solidiﬁ  es in  the shape of the mold cavity. The term  casting  is also  applied to the part that is made by this process. It is one  of the oldest shaping processes, dating back 6000 years  (Historical Note 10.1). The principle of casting seems  simple: melt the metal, pour it into a mold, and let it  cool and solidify; yet there are many factors and vari- ables that must be considered in order to accomplish a  successful casting operation.  

Casting includes both the casting of ingots and the  casting of shapes. The term  ingot  is usually associ- ated with the primary metals industries; it describes a  large casting that is simple in shape and intended for

# Historical Note 10.1  Origins of casting  

Casting of metals can be traced back to around 4000  B . C . E . Gold was the ﬁ  rst metal to be discovered and  used by the early civilizations; it was malleable and  could be readily hammered into shape at room tem- perature. There seemed to be no need for other ways  to shape gold. It was the subsequent discovery of cop- per that gave rise to the need for casting. Although  copper could be forged to shape, the process was  more difﬁ  cult (due to strain hardening) and limited to  relatively simple forms. Historians believe that hun- dreds of years elapsed before the process of cast- ing copper was ﬁ  rst performed, probably by accident  during the reduction of copper ore in preparation for  hammering the metal into some useful form. Thus,  through serendipity, the art of casting was born. It is  likely that the discovery occurred in Mesopotamia, and  the “technology” quickly spread throughout the rest  of the ancient world.  

It was an innovation of signiﬁ  cant importance  in the history of mankind. Shapes much more intri- cate could be formed by casting than by hammering.  More sophisticated tools and weapons could be fab- ricated. More detailed implements and ornaments  could be fashioned. Fine gold jewelry could be made  more beautiful and valuable than by previous meth- ods. Alloys were ﬁ  rst used for casting when it was  discovered that mixtures of copper and tin (the alloy  thus formed was bronze) yielded much better cast- ings than copper alone. Other casting processes are  near net shape , for which  some additional shape processing is required (usually machining) in order to  achieve accurate dimensions and details.

 $\succcurlyeq$   Casting can be used to produce very large parts. Castings weighing more than  100 tons have been made.

 $\succcurlyeq$ The casting process can be performed on any metal that can be heated to the  liquid state.

 $\succcurlyeq$ Some casting methods are quite suited to mass production.  

There are also disadvantages associated with casting—different disadvantages  for different casting methods. These include limitations on mechanical properties,  porosity, poor dimensional accuracy and surface ﬁ  nish for some casting processes,  safety hazards to humans when processing hot molten metals, and environmental  problems.  

Parts made by casting processes range in size from small components weighing  only a few ounces up to very large products weighing tons. The list of parts includes  dental crowns, jewelry, statues, wood-burning stoves, engine blocks and heads for  automotive vehicles, machine frames, railway wheels, frying pans, pipes, and pump  housings. All varieties of metals can be cast, ferrous and nonferrous.  

Casting can also be used on other materials such as polymers and ceramics;  however, the details are sufﬁ  ciently different that discussion of the casting proc- esses for these materials is postponed until later chapters. This chapter and the next  deal exclusively with metal casting. Here the fundamentals that apply to virtually  all casting operations are discussed. In the following chapter, the individual casting  processes are described, along with some of the product design issues that must be  considered when making parts out of castings.  

#  Overview of Casting Technology  

As a production process, casting is usually carried out in a foundry. A  foundry  is a  factory equipped for making molds, melting and handling metal in molten form,  performing the casting process, and cleaning the ﬁ  nished casting. The workers who  perform the casting operations in these factories are called  foundrymen .  

# 10.1.1  CASTING PROCESSES  

Discussion of casting logically begins with the mold. The  mold  contains a cavity  whose geometry determines the shape of the cast part. The actual size and shape  of the cavity must be slightly oversized to allow for shrinkage that occurs in the  metal during solidiﬁ  cation and cooling. Different metals undergo different amounts  of shrinkage, so the mold cavity must be designed for the particular metal to be cast  if dimensional accuracy is critical. Molds are made of a variety of materials, including  sand, plaster, ceramic, and metal. The various casting processes are often classiﬁ  ed  according to these different types of molds.  

To accomplish a casting operation, the metal is ﬁ  rst heated to a temperature high  enough to completely transform it into a liquid state. It is then poured, or otherwise  directed, into the cavity of the mold. In an  open mold , Figure 10.2(a), the liquid  metal is simply poured until it ﬁ  lls the open cavity. In a  closed mold , Figure 10.2(b), a  passageway, called the gating system, is provided to permit the molten metal to ﬂ  ow  from outside the mold into the cavity. The closed mold is by far the more important  category in production casting operations.  

As soon as the molten metal is in the mold, it begins to cool. When the tem- perature drops sufﬁ  ciently (e.g., to the freezing point for a pure metal), solidiﬁ  cation  begins. Solidiﬁ  cation involves a change of phase of the metal. Time is required to  complete the phase change, and considerable heat is given up in the process. It is  during this step in the process that the metal assumes the solid shape of the mold  cavity and many of the properties and characteristics of the casting are established.  

Once the casting has cooled sufﬁ  ciently, it is removed from the mold. Depending  on the casting method and metal used, further processing may be required. This

11.7 Product Design Considerations  

Metal casting processes divide into two categories, based  on mold type: (1) expendable mold and (2) permanent  mold. In expendable mold casting operations, the mold  is sacriﬁ  ced in order to remove the cast part. Since a new  mold is required for each new casting, production rates  in expendable-mold processes are often limited by the  time required to make the mold rather than the time  to make the casting itself. However, for certain part  geometries, sand molds can be produced and castings  made at rates of 400 parts per hour and higher. In per- manent mold casting processes, the mold is fabricated  out of metal (or other durable material) and can be used  many times to make many castings. Accordingly, these  processes possess a natural advantage in terms of higher  production rates.  

The discussion of casting processes in this chapter  is organized as follows: (1) sand casting, (2) other ex- pendable mold casting processes, and (3) permanent  mold casting processes. The chapter also includes cast- ing equipment and practices used in foundries. Another  section deals with inspection and quality issues. Product  design guidelines are presented in the ﬁ  nal section.

#  Sand Casting  

Sand casting is the most widely used casting process, ac- counting for a signiﬁ  cant majority of the total tonnage  cast. Nearly all casting alloys can be sand cast; indeed, it  is one of the few processes that can be used for metals  with high melting temperatures, such as steels, nickels,  and titaniums. Its versatility permits the casting of parts  ranging in size from small to very large and in produc- tion quantities from one to millions. Figure 11.1 shows a  cast iron sand casting of a pump housing that has been  partially machined to create accurate holes and surfaces.  

Sand casting , also known as  sand-mold casting , con- sists of pouring molten metal into a sand mold, allowing  the metal to solidify, and then breaking up the mold to  remove the casting. The casting must then be cleaned  and inspected, and heat treatment is sometimes required

to improve metallurgical properties. The cavity in the sand mold is formed by pack- ing sand around a pattern (an approximate duplicate of the part to be cast), and then  removing the pattern by separating the mold into two halves. The mold also contains  the gating and riser system. In addition, if the casting is to have internal surfaces (e.g.,  hollow parts or parts with holes), a core must be included in the mold. Since the mold  is sacriﬁ  ced to remove the casting, a new sand mold must be made for each part that  is produced. From this brief description, sand casting is seen to include not only the  casting operation itself, but also the fabrication of the pattern and the making of the  mold. The production sequence is outlined in Figure 11.2.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec10.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec10.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec11.txt","0.8502547953765326, 0.8467774999811697, 0.8421930152116535"

# 11.3.3  DIE CASTING  

Die casting is a permanent-mold casting process in which the molten metal is in- jected into the mold cavity under high pressure. Typical pressures are 7 to $350\;\mathrm{MPa}$   $(1000{-}50{,}000{\,}1\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ). The pressure is maintained during solidiﬁ  cation, after which the  mold is opened and the part is removed. Molds in this casting operation are called  dies; hence the name die casting. The use of high pressure to force the metal into the  die cavity is the most notable feature that distinguishes this process from others in  the permanent mold category.  

Die-casting operations are carried out in special die-casting machines (Historical  Note 11.2), which are designed to hold and accurately close the two halves of the  mold, and keep them closed while the liquid metal is forced into the cavity. The gen- eral conﬁ  guration is shown in Figure 11.13. There are two main types of die-casting  machines: (1) hot-chamber and (2) cold-chamber, differentiated by how the molten  metal is injected into the cavity.  

# Historical Note 11.2  Die-casting machines  

The modern die-casting machine has its origins in  the printing industry and the need in the mid- to late  1800s to satisfy an increasingly literate population  with a growing appetite for reading. The linotype,  invented and developed by O. Mergenthaler in the  late 1800s, is a machine that produces printing  type. It is a casting machine because it casts a line  of type characters out of lead to be used in prepar- ing printing plates. The name  linotype  derives  from the fact that the machine produces a line of  type characters during each cycle of operation.  The machine was ﬁ  rst used successfully on a commer- cial basis in New York City by  The T ribune  in 1886.  

The linotype proved the feasibility of mechanized  casting machines. The ﬁ  rst die-casting machine was pat- ented by H. Doehler in 1905 (this machine is displayed in  the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C.). In 1907 ,  E. Wagner developed the ﬁ  rst die-casting machine to  utilize the hot-chamber design. It was ﬁ  rst used during  World War I to cast parts for binoculars and gas masks.

FIGURE 11.13  General  conﬁ  guration of a  (cold-chamber)  die-casting machine.  

In  hot-chamber machines , the metal is melted in a container attached to the ma- chine, and a piston is used to inject the liquid metal under high pressure into the die.  Typical injection pressures are 7 to $35\,\mathrm{MPa}$   $(1000{-}5000\,\mathrm{lb/in}^{2})$ . The casting cycle is sum- marized in Figure 11.14. Production rates up to 500 parts per hour are not uncommon.  Hot-chamber die casting imposes a special hardship on the injection system because  much of it is submerged in the molten metal.

sprayed on the cavity. Preheating facilitates metal ﬂ  ow through the gating system  and into the cavity. The coatings aid heat dissipation and lubricate the mold sur- faces for easier separation of the cast product. After pouring, as soon as the metal  solidiﬁ  es, the mold is opened and the casting is removed. Unlike expendable molds,  permanent molds do not collapse, so the mold must be opened before appreciable  cooling contraction occurs in order to prevent cracks from developing in the casting.  

Advantages of permanent-mold casting include good surface ﬁ  nish and close  dimensional control, as previously indicated. In addition, more rapid solidiﬁ  cation  caused by the metal mold results in a ﬁ  ner grain structure, so stronger castings are  produced. The process is generally limited to metals of lower melting points. Other  limitations include simple part geometries compared to sand casting (because of  the need to open the mold), and the expense of the mold. Because mold cost is sub- stantial, the process is best suited to high-volume production and can be automated  accordingly. Typical parts include automotive pistons, pump bodies, and certain cast- ings for aircraft and missiles.  

# 11.3.2  VARIATIONS OF PERMANENT-MOLD CASTING  

Several casting processes are quite similar to the basic permanent-mold method. These  include slush casting, low-pressure casting, and vacuum permanent-mold casting.  

Slush Casting  Slush casting is a permanent mold process in which a hollow cast- ing is formed by inverting the mold after partial freezing at the surface to drain out  the liquid metal in the center. Solidiﬁ  cation begins at the mold walls because they  are relatively cool, and it progresses over time toward the middle of the casting  (Section 10.3.1). Thickness of the shell is controlled by the length of time allowed  before draining. Slush casting is used to make statues, lamp pedestals, and toys out  of low-melting-point metals such as zinc and tin. In these items, the exterior appear- ance is important, but the strength and interior geometry of the casting are minor  considerations.  

Low-Pressure Casting  In the basic permanent mold casting process and in slush  casting, the ﬂ  ow of metal into the mold cavity is caused by gravity. In low-pressure  casting, the liquid metal is forced into the cavity under low pressure—approximately  $0.1\ \mathrm{MPa}$   $(15\ \mathrm{lb/in}^{2})$ )—from beneath so that the ﬂ  ow is upward, as illustrated in  Figure 11.12. The advantage of this approach over traditional pouring is that clean  molten metal from the center of the ladle is introduced into the mold, rather  than metal that has been exposed to air. Gas porosity and oxidation defects are  thereby minimized, and mechanical properties are improved.  

Vacuum Permanent-Mold Casting   Not to be confused with vacuum molding  (Section 11.2.2), this process is a variation of low-pressure casting in which a vacuum  is used to draw the molten metal into the mold cavity. The general conﬁ  guration of  the vacuum permanent-mold casting process is similar to the low-pressure casting  operation. The difference is that reduced air pressure from the vacuum in the mold  is used to draw the liquid metal into the cavity, rather than forcing it by positive air  pressure from below. There are several beneﬁ  ts of the vacuum technique relative  to low-pressure casting: air porosity and related defects are reduced, and greater  strength is given to the cast product.

As soon as the molten metal is in the mold, it begins to cool. When the tem- perature drops sufﬁ  ciently (e.g., to the freezing point for a pure metal), solidiﬁ  cation  begins. Solidiﬁ  cation involves a change of phase of the metal. Time is required to  complete the phase change, and considerable heat is given up in the process. It is  during this step in the process that the metal assumes the solid shape of the mold  cavity and many of the properties and characteristics of the casting are established.  

Once the casting has cooled sufﬁ  ciently, it is removed from the mold. Depending  on the casting method and metal used, further processing may be required. This

may include trimming any excess metal from the actual cast part, cleaning the sur- face, inspecting the product, and heat treatment to enhance properties. In addition,  machining may be required to achieve closer tolerances on certain part features and  to remove the cast surface.  

Casting processes divide into two broad categories, according to type of mold  used: expendable mold casting and permanent mold casting. An  expendable mold means that the mold in which the molten metal solidiﬁ  es must be destroyed in order  to remove the casting. These molds are made out of sand, plaster, or similar materi- als, whose form is maintained by using binders of various kinds. Sand casting is the  most prominent example of the expendable mold processes. In sand casting, the  liquid metal is poured into a mold made of sand. After the metal hardens, the mold  must be sacriﬁ  ced in order to recover the casting.  

A  permanent mold  is one that can be used over and over to produce many cast- ings. It is made of metal (or, less commonly, a ceramic refractory material) that  can withstand the high temperatures of the casting operation. In permanent mold  casting, the mold consists of two (or more) sections that can be opened to permit  removal of the ﬁ  nished part. Die casting is the most familiar process in this group.  

More intricate casting geometries are generally possible with the expendable  mold processes. Part shapes in the permanent mold processes are limited by the  need to open the mold. On the other hand, some of the permanent mold processes  have certain economic advantages in high production operations. The expendable  mold and permanent mold casting processes are described in Chapter 11.

Sand casting is by far the most important casting process. A sand-casting mold will  be used to describe the basic features of a mold. Many of these features and terms  are common to the molds used in other casting processes. Figure 10.2(b) shows the  cross-sectional view of a typical sand-casting mold, indicating some of the terminol- ogy. The mold consists of two halves: cope and drag. The  cope  is the upper half of the  mold, and the  drag  is the bottom half. These two mold parts are contained in a box,  called a  ﬂ  ask , which is also divided into two halves, one for the cope and the other  for the drag. The two halves of the mold separate at the  parting line .  

In sand casting (and other expendable mold processes) the mold cavity is formed  by means of a  pattern , which is made of wood, metal, plastic, or other material and  has the shape of the part to be cast. The cavity is formed by packing sand around the  pattern, about half each in the cope and drag, so that when the pattern is removed,  the remaining void has the desired shape of the cast part. The pattern is usually  made oversized to allow for shrinkage of the metal as it solidiﬁ  es and cools. The sand  for the mold is moist and contains a binder to maintain its shape.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec11.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec11.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec10.txt","0.8691694869915618, 0.8648357005425182, 0.8570519484298701"

Alloys are  generally easier to cast, and properties of the resulting product are better. Casting  alloys can be classiﬁ  ed as ferrous or nonferrous. The ferrous category is subdivided  into cast iron and cast steel.  

Ferrous Casting Alloys: Cast Iron   Cast iron is the most important of all cast- ing alloys (Historical Note 11.3). The tonnage of cast iron castings is several times  that of all other metals combined. There are several types of cast iron: (1) gray  cast iron, (2) nodular iron, (3) white cast iron, (4) malleable iron, and (5) alloy cast  irons (Section 6.2.4). Typical pouring temperatures for cast iron are around $1400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(2500^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ , depending on composition.  

# H istorical  N ote  11.3   Early cast iron products  

In the early centuries of casting, bronze and brass  were preferred over cast iron as foundry metals. Iron  was more difﬁ  cult to cast, due to its higher melting  temperatures and lack of knowledge about its metal- lurgy. Also, there was little demand for cast iron prod- ucts. This all changed starting in the sixteenth and  seventeenth centuries.  

The art of sand casting iron entered Europe from  China, where iron was cast in sand molds more than  2,500 years ago. In 1550 the ﬁ  rst cannons were cast  from iron in Europe. Cannon balls for these guns were  made of cast iron starting around 1568. Guns and their  projectiles created a large demand for cast iron. But  these items were for military rather than civilian use.  Two cast iron products that became signiﬁ  cant to the  general public in the sixteenth and seventeenth centu- ries were the cast iron stove and cast iron water pipe.  

As unspectacular a product as it may seem today,  the cast iron stove brought comfort, health, and  improved living conditions to many people in Europe  and America. During the 1700s, the manufacture of  cast iron stoves was one of the largest and most prof- itable industries on these two continents. The com- mercial success of stove making was due to the large  demand for the product and the art and technology of  casting iron that had been developed to produce it.  

Cast iron water pipe was another product that  spurred the growth of the iron casting industry. Until  the advent of cast iron pipes, a variety of methods  had been tried to supply water directly to homes  and shops, including hollow wooden pipes (which  quickly rotted), lead pipes (too expensive), and open  trenches (susceptible to pollution). Development of  the iron-casting process provided the capability to  fabricate water pipe sections at relatively low cost.  Cast iron water pipes were used in France starting  in 1664, and later in other parts of Europe. By the  early 1800s, cast iron pipe lines were being widely  installed in England for water and gas delivery. The  ﬁ  rst signiﬁ  cant water pipe installation in the United  States was in Philadelphia in 1817 , using pipe  imported from England.  

Ferrous Casting Alloys: Steel   The mechanical properties of steel make it an  attractive engineering material, and the capability to create complex geometries  makes casting an appealing process. However, great difﬁ  culties are faced by the  foundry specializing in steel. First, the melting point of steel is considerably higher  than for most other metals that are commonly cast. The solidiﬁ  cation range for low  carbon steels (Figure 6.4) begins at just under  $1540^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(2800^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ . This means that  the pouring temperature required for steel is very high—about  $1650^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(3000^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ). At  these high temperatures, steel is chemically very reactive. It readily oxidizes, so spe- cial procedures must be used during melting and pouring to isolate the molten metal  from air. However, great difﬁ  culties are faced by the  foundry specializing in steel. First, the melting point of steel is considerably higher  than for most other metals that are commonly cast. The solidiﬁ  cation range for low  carbon steels (Figure 6.4) begins at just under  $1540^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(2800^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ . This means that  the pouring temperature required for steel is very high—about  $1650^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(3000^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ). At  these high temperatures, steel is chemically very reactive. It readily oxidizes, so spe- cial procedures must be used during melting and pouring to isolate the molten metal  from air. Also, molten steel has relatively poor ﬂ  uidity, and this limits the design of  thin sections in components cast out of steel.  

Several characteristics of steel castings make it worth the effort to solve these  problems. Tensile strength is higher than for most other casting metals, ranging  upward from about  $410\,\mathrm{MPa}$   $(60,\!000\,\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ) [9]. Steel castings have better toughness  than most other casting alloys. The properties of steel castings are isotropic; strength  is virtually the same in all directions. By contrast, mechanically formed parts (e.g.,  rolling, forging) exhibit directionality in their properties. Depending on the require- ments of the product, isotropic behavior of the material may be desirable. Another  advantage of steel castings is ease of welding. They can be readily welded without  signiﬁ  cant loss of strength, to repair the casting, or to fabricate structures with other  steel components.  

Nonferrous Casting Alloys   Nonferrous casting metals include alloys of aluminum,  magnesium, copper, tin, zinc, nickel, and titanium (Section 6.3).  Aluminum alloys are generally considered to be very castable. The melting point of pure aluminum is  $660^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(1220^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ , so pouring temperatures for aluminum casting alloys are low com- pared to cast iron and steel. Their properties make them attractive for castings: light  weight, wide range of strength properties attainable through heat treatment, and ease  of machining.  Magnesium alloys  are the lightest of all casting metals. Other proper- ties include corrosion resistance, as well as high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to- weight ratios.  

Copper alloys  include bronze, brass, and aluminum bronze. Properties that make  them attractive include corrosion resistance, attractive appearance, and good bearing  qualities. The high cost of copper is a limitation on the use of its alloys. Applications  include pipe ﬁ  ttings, marine propeller blades, pump components, and ornamental  jewelry.  

Tin has the lowest melting point of the casting metals.  Tin-based alloys  are  generally easy to cast. They have good corrosion resistant but poor mechanical  strength, which limits their applications to pewter mugs and similar products not  requiring high strength.  Zinc alloys  are commonly used in die casting. Zinc has  a low melting point and good ﬂ  uidity, making it highly castable. Its major weak- ness is low creep strength, so its castings cannot be subjected to prolonged high  stresses.  

Nickel alloys  have good hot strength and corrosion resistance, which make them  suited to high-temperature applications such as jet engine and rocket components,  heat shields, and similar components. Nickel alloys also have a high melting point  and are not easy to cast.  Titanium alloys  for casting are corrosion resistant and pos- sess high strength-to-weight ratios. However, titanium has a high melting point, low  ﬂ  uidity, and a propensity to oxidize at high temperatures. These properties make it  and its alloys difﬁ  cult to cast.

➢   Geometric simplicity . Although casting is a process that can be used to produce  complex part geometries, simplifying the part design will improve its castability.  Avoiding unnecessary complexities simpliﬁ  es mold making, reduces the need  for cores, and improves the strength of the casting.

 ➢   Corners .   Sharp corners and angles should be avoided, because they are sources  of stress concentrations and may cause hot tearing and cracks in the casting.  Generous ﬁ  llets should be designed on inside corners, and sharp edges should  be blended.

# 10.1.2  SAND-CASTING MOLDS  

Sand casting is by far the most important casting process. A sand-casting mold will  be used to describe the basic features of a mold. Many of these features and terms  are common to the molds used in other casting processes. Figure 10.2(b) shows the  cross-sectional view of a typical sand-casting mold, indicating some of the terminol- ogy. The mold consists of two halves: cope and drag. The  cope  is the upper half of the  mold, and the  drag  is the bottom half. These two mold parts are contained in a box,  called a  ﬂ  ask , which is also divided into two halves, one for the cope and the other  for the drag. The two halves of the mold separate at the  parting line .  

In sand casting (and other expendable mold processes) the mold cavity is formed  by means of a  pattern , which is made of wood, metal, plastic, or other material and  has the shape of the part to be cast. The cavity is formed by packing sand around the  pattern, about half each in the cope and drag, so that when the pattern is removed,  the remaining void has the desired shape of the cast part. The pattern is usually  made oversized to allow for shrinkage of the metal as it solidiﬁ  es and cools. The sand  for the mold is moist and contains a binder to maintain its shape. To a lesser degree, other expendable mold processes are also sus- ceptible to these problems. Defects found primarily in sand castings are shown in  Figure 11.25 and described here:  

![](images/2ab4623342c3ec88da17eeafb3b611b74379e3829dc5640407d44c796390da6c.jpg)  
FIGURE 11.25  Common defects in  sand castings: (a) sand  blow, (b) pin holes, (c)  sand wash, (d) scabs,  (e) penetration, (f) mold  shift, (g) core shift, and  (h) mold crack.  

(a)  Sand blow  is a defect consisting of a balloon-shaped gas cavity caused by  release of mold gases during pouring. It occurs at or below the casting surface  near the top of the casting. Low permeability, poor venting, and high moisture  content of the sand mold are the usual causes.

 (b)  Pinholes ,   also caused by release of gases during pouring, consist of many small  gas cavities formed at or slightly below the surface of the casting.

 (c)  Sand wash ,   which is an irregularity in the surface of the casting that results  from erosion of the sand mold during pouring, and the contour of the erosion is  formed in the surface of the ﬁ  nal cast part.

 (d)  Scabs  are rough areas on the surface of the casting due to encrustations of sand  and metal. It is caused by portions of the mold surface ﬂ  aking off during solidi- ﬁ  cation and becoming imbedded in the casting surface.

 (e)  Penetration  refers to a surface defect that occurs when the ﬂ  uidity of the liquid  metal is high, and it penetrates into the sand mold or sand core. Upon freezing,  the casting surface consists of a mixture of sand grains and metal. Harder pack- ing of the sand mold helps to alleviate this condition.

 (f)  Mold shift  refers to a defect caused by a sidewise displacement of the mold  cope relative to the drag, the result of which is a step in the cast product at the  parting line.

 (g)  Core shift  is similar to mold shift, but it is the core that is displaced, and the dis- placement is usually vertical. Core shift and mold shift are caused by buoyancy  of the molten metal (Section 11.1.3).

 (h)  Mold crack  occurs when mold strength is insufﬁ  cient, and a crack develops, into  which liquid metal can seep to form a “ﬁ  n” on the ﬁ  nal casting.  

Inspection Methods   Foundry inspection procedures include (1) visual inspection  to detect obvious defects such as misruns, cold shuts, and severe surface ﬂ  aws; (2)  dimensional measurements to ensure that tolerances have been met; and (3) metal- lurgical, chemical, physical, and other tests concerned with the inherent quality of  the cast metal [7]. Tests in category (3) include: (a) pressure testing—to locate leaks  in the casting; (b) radiographic methods, magnetic particle tests, the use of ﬂ  uores- cent penetrants, and supersonic testing—to detect either surface or internal defects  in the casting; and (c) mechanical testing to determine properties such as tensile  strength and hardness. If defects are discovered but are not too serious, it is often  possible to save the casting by welding, grinding, or other salvage methods to which  the customer has agreed.  

Most commercial castings are made of alloys rather than pure metals. Alloys are  generally easier to cast, and properties of the resulting product are better. Casting  alloys can be classiﬁ  ed as ferrous or nonferrous. The ferrous category is subdivided  into cast iron and cast steel.  

Ferrous Casting Alloys: Cast Iron   Cast iron is the most important of all cast- ing alloys (Historical Note 11.3). The tonnage of cast iron castings is several times  that of all other metals combined.

Three types of crucible furnaces are used in foundries: (a) lift-out type, (b)  stationary, and (c) tilting, illustrated in Figure 11.21.

high-temperature steel alloy to hold the charge. In the  lift-out crucible furnace , the  crucible is placed in a furnace and heated sufﬁ  ciently to melt the metal charge. Oil, gas,  or powdered coal are typical fuels for these furnaces. When the metal is melted, the  crucible is lifted out of the furnace and used as a pouring ladle. The other two types,  sometimes referred to as  pot furnaces , have the heating furnace and container as one  integral unit. In the  stationary pot furnace , the furnace is stationary and the molten  metal is ladled out of the container. In the  tilting-pot furnace , the entire assembly can  be tilted for pouring. Crucible furnaces are used for nonferrous metals such as bronze,  brass, and alloys of zinc and aluminum. Furnace capacities are generally limited to  several hundred pounds.  

Electric-Arc Furnaces   In this furnace type, the charge is melted by heat gener- ated from an electric arc. Various conﬁ  gurations are available, with two or three  electrodes (Figure 6.9). Power consumption is high, but electric-arc furnaces can be  designed for high melting capacity  $(23\mathrm{,}000{-}45\mathrm{,}000\;\mathrm{kg/hr}$  or 25–50 tons/hr), and they  are used primarily for casting steel.  

Induction Furnaces   An induction furnace uses alternating current passing  through a coil to develop a magnetic ﬁ  eld in the metal, and the resulting induced  current causes rapid heating and melting of the metal. Features of an induction  furnace for foundry operations are illustrated in Figure 11.22. The electromagnetic

force ﬁ  eld causes a mixing action to occur in the liquid metal. Also, since the metal  does not come in direct contact with the heating elements, the environment in which  melting takes place can be closely controlled. All of this results in molten metals of  high quality and purity, and induction furnaces are used for nearly any casting alloy  when these requirements are important. Melting steel, cast iron, and aluminum al- loys are common applications in foundry work.  

# 11.4.2  POURING, CLEANING, AND HEAT TREATMENT  

Moving the molten metal from the melting furnace to the mold is sometimes done  using crucibles. More often, the transfer is accomplished by  ladles  of various kinds.  These ladles receive the metal from the furnace and allow for convenient pouring  into the molds. Two common ladles are illustrated in Figure 11.23, one for handling  large volumes of molten metal using an overhead crane, and the other a “two-man  ladle” for manually moving and pouring smaller amounts.  

One of the problems in pouring is that oxidized molten metal can be introduced  into the mold. ![](images/2e9c442ffa305916105dc642fcafc5e1a04fa0f7362571cdf8bf17f157d07b23.jpg)  
FIGURE 11.19  (a) Centrifuge  casting—centrifugal  force causes metal to  ﬂ  ow to the mold  cavities away from the  axis of rotation; and  (b) the casting.  

Centrifuge Casting   In centrifuge casting, Figure 11.19, the mold is designed with  part cavities located away from the axis of rotation, so that the molten metal poured  into the mold is distributed to these cavities by centrifugal force. The process is used  for smaller parts, and radial symmetry of the part is not a requirement as it is for the  other two centrifugal casting methods.  

# 11.4 11.4  Foundry Practice  

In all casting processes, the metal must be heated to the molten state to be poured or  otherwise forced into the mold. Heating and melting are accomplished in a furnace.  This section covers the various types of furnaces used in foundries and the pouring  practices for delivering the molten metal from furnace to mold.  

# 11.4.1  FURNACES  

The types of furnaces most commonly used in foundries are (1) cupolas, (2) direct  fuel-ﬁ  red furnaces, (3) crucible furnaces, (4) electric-arc furnaces, and (5) induction  furnaces. Selection of the most appropriate furnace type depends on factors such  as the casting alloy; its melting and pouring temperatures; capacity requirements of  the furnace; costs of investment, operation, and maintenance; and environmental  pollution considerations.  

Cupolas   A cupola is a vertical cylindrical furnace equipped with a tapping spout  near its base. Cupolas are used only for melting cast irons, and although other fur- naces are also used, the largest tonnage of cast iron is melted in cupolas. General  construction and operating features of the cupola are illustrated in Figure 11.20. It  consists of a large shell of steel plate lined with refractory. The “charge,” consisting  of iron, coke, ﬂ  ux, and possible alloying elements, is loaded through a charging door  located less than halfway up the height of the cupola. The iron is usually a mixture  of pig iron and scrap (including risers, runners, and sprues left over from previous  castings). Coke is the fuel used to heat the furnace. Forced air is introduced through  openings near the bottom of the shell for combustion of the coke. The ﬂ  ux is a basic  

![](images/2290e45e2ff807680e7eac19261e8f15f845b214aef610791e3bd22e2511f128.jpg)

compound such as limestone that reacts with coke ash and other impurities to form  slag. The slag serves to cover the melt, protecting it from reaction with the environ- ment inside the cupola and reducing heat loss. As the mixture is heated and melting  of the iron occurs, the furnace is periodically tapped to provide liquid metal for the  pour.  

Direct Fuel-Fired Furnaces   A direct fuel-ﬁ  red furnace contains a small open  hearth, in which the metal charge is heated by fuel burners located on the side of  the furnace. The roof of the furnace assists the heating action by reﬂ  ecting the ﬂ  ame  down against the charge. Typical fuel is natural gas, and the combustion products  exit the furnace through a stack. At the bottom of the hearth is a tap hole to release  the molten metal. Direct fuel-ﬁ  red furnaces are generally used in casting for melting  nonferrous metals such as copper-base alloys and aluminum.  

Crucible Furnaces   These furnaces melt the metal without direct contact with a  burning fuel mixture. For this reason, they are sometimes called  indirect fuel-ﬁ  red  furnaces . Three types of crucible furnaces are used in foundries: (a) lift-out type, (b)  stationary, and (c) tilting, illustrated in Figure 11.21. However, great difﬁ  culties are faced by the  foundry specializing in steel. First, the melting point of steel is considerably higher  than for most other metals that are commonly cast. The solidiﬁ  cation range for low  carbon steels (Figure 6.4) begins at just under  $1540^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(2800^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ . This means that  the pouring temperature required for steel is very high—about  $1650^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(3000^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ). At  these high temperatures, steel is chemically very reactive. It readily oxidizes, so spe- cial procedures must be used during melting and pouring to isolate the molten metal  from air. Also, molten steel has relatively poor ﬂ  uidity, and this limits the design of  thin sections in components cast out of steel.  

Several characteristics of steel castings make it worth the effort to solve these  problems. Tensile strength is higher than for most other casting metals, ranging  upward from about  $410\,\mathrm{MPa}$   $(60,\!000\,\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ) [9]. Steel castings have better toughness  than most other casting alloys. The properties of steel castings are isotropic; strength  is virtually the same in all directions. By contrast, mechanically formed parts (e.g.,  rolling, forging) exhibit directionality in their properties. Depending on the require- ments of the product, isotropic behavior of the material may be desirable. Another  advantage of steel castings is ease of welding. They can be readily welded without  signiﬁ  cant loss of strength, to repair the casting, or to fabricate structures with other  steel components.  

Nonferrous Casting Alloys   Nonferrous casting metals include alloys of aluminum,  magnesium, copper, tin, zinc, nickel, and titanium (Section 6.3).  Aluminum alloys are generally considered to be very castable. The melting point of pure aluminum is  $660^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(1220^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ , so pouring temperatures for aluminum casting alloys are low com- pared to cast iron and steel. Their properties make them attractive for castings: light  weight, wide range of strength properties attainable through heat treatment, and ease  of machining.  Magnesium alloys  are the lightest of all casting metals. Other proper- ties include corrosion resistance, as well as high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to- weight ratios.  

Copper alloys  include bronze, brass, and aluminum bronze. Properties that make  them attractive include corrosion resistance, attractive appearance, and good bearing  qualities. The high cost of copper is a limitation on the use of its alloys. Applications  include pipe ﬁ  ttings, marine propeller blades, pump components, and ornamental  jewelry.  

Tin has the lowest melting point of the casting metals.  Tin-based alloys  are  generally easy to cast. They have good corrosion resistant but poor mechanical  strength, which limits their applications to pewter mugs and similar products not  requiring high strength.  Zinc alloys  are commonly used in die casting. Zinc has  a low melting point and good ﬂ  uidity, making it highly castable. Its major weak- ness is low creep strength, so its castings cannot be subjected to prolonged high  stresses.  

Nickel alloys  have good hot strength and corrosion resistance, which make them  suited to high-temperature applications such as jet engine and rocket components,  heat shields, and similar components. Nickel alloys also have a high melting point  and are not easy to cast.  Titanium alloys  for casting are corrosion resistant and pos- sess high strength-to-weight ratios. However, titanium has a high melting point, low  ﬂ  uidity, and a propensity to oxidize at high temperatures. These properties make it  and its alloys difﬁ  cult to cast.  

# 11.7 11.7  Product Design Considerations  

If casting is selected by the product designer as the primary manufacturing process  for a particular component, then certain guidelines should be followed to facilitate  production of the part and avoid many of the defects enumerated in Section 11.5.  Some of the important guidelines and considerations for casting are presented here.

These quality issues are considered in the following section.  

Castings are often heat treated to enhance their properties, either for subsequent  processing operations such as machining or to bring out the desired properties for  application of the part.  

There are numerous opportunities for things to go wrong in a casting operation,  resulting in quality defects in the cast product. In this section, the common defects  that occur in casting are listed, and the inspection procedures to detect them are  indicated.  

Casting Defects   Some defects are common to any and all casting processes.  These defects are illustrated in Figure 11.24 and brieﬂ  y described in the following:  

(a)  Misruns ,   which are castings that solidify before completely ﬁ  lling the mold  cavity. Typical causes include (1) ﬂ  uidity of the molten metal is insufﬁ  cient, (2)  pouring temperature is too low, (3) pouring is done too slowly, and/or (4) cross  section of the mold cavity is too thin.

 (b)  Cold Shuts ,   which occur when two portions of the metal ﬂ  ow together but there  is a lack of fusion between them due to premature freezing. Its causes are similar  to those of a misrun.

 (c)  Cold shots ,   which result from splattering during pouring, causing the forma- tion of solid globules of metal that become entrapped in the casting. Pouring  procedures and gating system designs that avoid splattering can prevent this  defect.

 (d)  Shrinkage cavity  is a depression in the surface or an internal void in the cast- ing, caused by solidiﬁ  cation shrinkage that restricts the amount of molten metal  available in the last region to freeze. It often occurs near the top of the casting,  in which case it is referred to as a “pipe.” See Figure 10.8(3). The problem can  often be solved by proper riser design.

 (e)  Microporosity  consists of a network of small voids distributed throughout the  casting caused by localized solidiﬁ  cation shrinkage of the ﬁ  nal molten metal in  the dendritic structure. The defect is usually associated with alloys, because of  the protracted manner in which freezing occurs in these metals.  

![](images/72feb180f51a7277c6d3fb4954adf6624f199c9dc04b7b467c14396aede55227.jpg)  
FIGURE 11.24  Some  common defects in  castings: (a) misrun,  (b) cold shut, (c) cold  shot, (d) shrinkage  cavity, (e) microporosity,  and (f) hot tearing.  

(f)  Hot tearing ,   also called  hot cracking , occurs when the casting is restrained  from contraction by an unyielding mold during the ﬁ  nal stages of solidiﬁ  cation  or early stages of cooling after solidiﬁ  cation. The defect is manifested as a sepa- ration of the metal (hence, the terms  tearing  and  cracking ) at a point of high  tensile stress caused by the metal’s inability to shrink naturally. In sand cast- ing and other expendable-mold processes, it is prevented by compounding the  mold to be collapsible. In permanent-mold processes, hot tearing is reduced by  removing the part from the mold immediately after solidiﬁ  cation.  

Some defects are related to the use of sand molds, and therefore they occur only  in sand castings. To a lesser degree, other expendable mold processes are also sus- ceptible to these problems. Defects found primarily in sand castings are shown in  Figure 11.25 and described here:

(a)  Sand blow  is a defect consisting of a balloon-shaped gas cavity caused by  release of mold gases during pouring. To a lesser degree, other expendable mold processes are also sus- ceptible to these problems. Defects found primarily in sand castings are shown in  Figure 11.25 and described here:

(a)  Sand blow  is a defect consisting of a balloon-shaped gas cavity caused by  release of mold gases during pouring. It occurs at or below the casting surface  near the top of the casting. Low permeability, poor venting, and high moisture  content of the sand mold are the usual causes.

 (b)  Pinholes ,   also caused by release of gases during pouring, consist of many small  gas cavities formed at or slightly below the surface of the casting.

 (c)  Sand wash ,   which is an irregularity in the surface of the casting that results  from erosion of the sand mold during pouring, and the contour of the erosion is  formed in the surface of the ﬁ  nal cast part.

 (d)  Scabs  are rough areas on the surface of the casting due to encrustations of sand  and metal. It is caused by portions of the mold surface ﬂ  aking off during solidi- ﬁ  cation and becoming imbedded in the casting surface.

 (e)  Penetration  refers to a surface defect that occurs when the ﬂ  uidity of the liquid  metal is high, and it penetrates into the sand mold or sand core. Upon freezing,  the casting surface consists of a mixture of sand grains and metal. Harder pack- ing of the sand mold helps to alleviate this condition.

 (f)  Mold shift  refers to a defect caused by a sidewise displacement of the mold  cope relative to the drag, the result of which is a step in the cast product at the  parting line.

 (g)  Core shift  is similar to mold shift, but it is the core that is displaced, and the dis- placement is usually vertical. Core shift and mold shift are caused by buoyancy  of the molten metal (Section 11.1.3).

 (h)  Mold crack  occurs when mold strength is insufﬁ  cient, and a crack develops, into  which liquid metal can seep to form a “ﬁ  n” on the ﬁ  nal casting.  

Inspection Methods   Foundry inspection procedures include (1) visual inspection  to detect obvious defects such as misruns, cold shuts, and severe surface ﬂ  aws; (2)  dimensional measurements to ensure that tolerances have been met; and (3) metal- lurgical, chemical, physical, and other tests concerned with the inherent quality of  the cast metal [7]. Tests in category (3) include: (a) pressure testing—to locate leaks  in the casting; (b) radiographic methods, magnetic particle tests, the use of ﬂ  uores- cent penetrants, and supersonic testing—to detect either surface or internal defects  in the casting; and (c) mechanical testing to determine properties such as tensile  strength and hardness. If defects are discovered but are not too serious, it is often  possible to save the casting by welding, grinding, or other salvage methods to which  the customer has agreed.  

Most commercial castings are made of alloys rather than pure metals. Alloys are  generally easier to cast, and properties of the resulting product are better. Casting  alloys can be classiﬁ  ed as ferrous or nonferrous. The ferrous category is subdivided  into cast iron and cast steel.  

Ferrous Casting Alloys: Cast Iron   Cast iron is the most important of all cast- ing alloys (Historical Note 11.3). The tonnage of cast iron castings is several times  that of all other metals combined. There are several types of cast iron: (1) gray  cast iron, (2) nodular iron, (3) white cast iron, (4) malleable iron, and (5) alloy cast  irons (Section 6.2.4). Melting steel, cast iron, and aluminum al- loys are common applications in foundry work.  

# 11.4.2  POURING, CLEANING, AND HEAT TREATMENT  

Moving the molten metal from the melting furnace to the mold is sometimes done  using crucibles. More often, the transfer is accomplished by  ladles  of various kinds.  These ladles receive the metal from the furnace and allow for convenient pouring  into the molds. Two common ladles are illustrated in Figure 11.23, one for handling  large volumes of molten metal using an overhead crane, and the other a “two-man  ladle” for manually moving and pouring smaller amounts.  

One of the problems in pouring is that oxidized molten metal can be introduced  into the mold. Metal oxides reduce product quality, perhaps rendering the casting  defective, so measures are taken to minimize the entry of these oxides into the mold  during pouring. Filters are sometimes used to catch the oxides and other impurities  as the metal is poured from the spout, and ﬂ  uxes are used to cover the molten metal  to retard oxidation. In addition, ladles have been devised to pour the liquid metal  from the bottom, since the top surface is where the oxides accumulate.  

After the casting has solidiﬁ  ed and been removed from the mold, a number of  additional steps are usually required. These operations include (1) trimming, (2)  removing the core, (3) surface cleaning, (4) inspection, (5) repair, if required, and  (6) heat treatment. Steps (1) through (5) are collectively referred to in foundry work  as “cleaning.” The extent to which these additional operations are required varies  with casting processes and metals. When required, they are usually labor-intensive  and costly.  

Trimming  involves removal of sprues, runners, risers, parting-line ﬂ  ash, ﬁ  ns, chap- lets, and any other excess metal from the cast part. In the case of brittle casting alloys  and when the cross sections are relatively small, these appendages on the casting can  be broken off. Otherwise, hammering, shearing, hack-sawing, band-sawing, abrasive  wheel cutting, or various torch cutting methods are used.  

FIGURE 11.23  Two  common types of  ladles: (a) crane ladle  and (b) two-man ladle.

If cores have been used to cast the part, they must be removed. Most cores are  chemically bonded or oil-bonded sand, and they often fall out of the casting as the  binder deteriorates. In some cases, they are removed by shaking the casting, either  manually or mechanically. In rare instances, cores are removed by chemically dis- solving the bonding agent used in the sand core. Solid cores must be hammered or  pressed out.  

Surface cleaning is most important in the case of sand casting. In many of the  other casting methods, especially the permanent mold processes, this step can be  avoided.  Surface cleaning  involves removal of sand from the surface of the cast- ing and otherwise enhancing the appearance of the surface. Methods used to clean  the surface include tumbling, air-blasting with coarse sand grit or metal shot, wire  brushing, and chemical pickling (Section 27.1).  

Defects are possible in casting, and inspection is needed to detect their presence.  These quality issues are considered in the following section.

There are several types of cast iron: (1) gray  cast iron, (2) nodular iron, (3) white cast iron, (4) malleable iron, and (5) alloy cast  irons (Section 6.2.4).

# H istorical  N ote  11.3   Early cast iron products  

In the early centuries of casting, bronze and brass  were preferred over cast iron as foundry metals. Iron  was more difﬁ  cult to cast, due to its higher melting  temperatures and lack of knowledge about its metal- lurgy. Also, there was little demand for cast iron prod- ucts. This all changed starting in the sixteenth and  seventeenth centuries.  

The art of sand casting iron entered Europe from  China, where iron was cast in sand molds more than  2,500 years ago. In 1550 the ﬁ  rst cannons were cast  from iron in Europe. Cannon balls for these guns were  made of cast iron starting around 1568. Guns and their  projectiles created a large demand for cast iron. But  these items were for military rather than civilian use.  Two cast iron products that became signiﬁ  cant to the  general public in the sixteenth and seventeenth centu- ries were the cast iron stove and cast iron water pipe.  

As unspectacular a product as it may seem today,  the cast iron stove brought comfort, health, and  improved living conditions to many people in Europe  and America. During the 1700s, the manufacture of  cast iron stoves was one of the largest and most prof- itable industries on these two continents. The com- mercial success of stove making was due to the large  demand for the product and the art and technology of  casting iron that had been developed to produce it.  

Cast iron water pipe was another product that  spurred the growth of the iron casting industry. Until  the advent of cast iron pipes, a variety of methods  had been tried to supply water directly to homes  and shops, including hollow wooden pipes (which  quickly rotted), lead pipes (too expensive), and open  trenches (susceptible to pollution). Development of  the iron-casting process provided the capability to  fabricate water pipe sections at relatively low cost.  Cast iron water pipes were used in France starting  in 1664, and later in other parts of Europe. By the  early 1800s, cast iron pipe lines were being widely  installed in England for water and gas delivery. The  ﬁ  rst signiﬁ  cant water pipe installation in the United  States was in Philadelphia in 1817 , using pipe  imported from England.  

Ferrous Casting Alloys: Steel   The mechanical properties of steel make it an  attractive engineering material, and the capability to create complex geometries  makes casting an appealing process. However, great difﬁ  culties are faced by the  foundry specializing in steel. First, the melting point of steel is considerably higher  than for most other metals that are commonly cast. The solidiﬁ  cation range for low  carbon steels (Figure 6.4) begins at just under  $1540^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(2800^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ . This means that  the pouring temperature required for steel is very high—about  $1650^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(3000^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ). At  these high temperatures, steel is chemically very reactive. It readily oxidizes, so spe- cial procedures must be used during melting and pouring to isolate the molten metal  from air. The following nine sections cover the nonferrous  metals that are the most commercially and technologically important.

Aluminum and magnesium are light metals, and they are often specified in engineer-  ing applications for this feature. Both elements are abundant on Earth, aluminum  on land and magnesium in the sea, although neither is easily extracted from their  natural states.  

Properties and other data on aluminum are listed in Table 6.1(b). Among the  major metals, it is a relative newcomer, dating only to the late 1800s (Historical  Note 6.2). The coverage in this section includes (1) a brief description of how alumi-  num  is produced and (2) a discussion of the properties and the designation system for  the metal and its alloys.

It was the  The modern electrolytic process for producing alu-  sole producer of aluminum in the United States until   minum was based on the concurrent but independent  World War II.  

Aluminum Production  The principal aluminum ore is  bauxite , which consists  largely of hydrated aluminum oxide  $(\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}–\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O})$ ) and other oxides. Extraction of  the aluminum from bauxite can be summarized in three steps: (1) washing and  crushing the ore into fine powders; (2) the Bayer process, in which the bauxite is  converted to pure alumina  $\left(\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$ ; and (3) electrolysis, in which the alumina is  separated into aluminum and oxygen gas  $(\mathrm{O}_{2})$ . The  Bayer process , named after the  German chemist who developed it, involves solution of bauxite powders in aque-  ous caustic soda (NaOH) under pressure, followed by precipitation of pure $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ from solution. Alumina is commercially important in its own right as an engineering  ceramic (Chapter 7). The compressive strength of gray cast iron is significantly greater than  its tensile strength. Properties of the casting can be controlled to some extent by heat  treatment. Ductility of gray cast iron is very low; it is a relatively brit- tle material.  Products made from gray cast iron include automotive engine blocks and heads, motor  housings, and machine tool bases.  

Ductile Iron  This is an iron with the composition of gray iron in which the mol-  ten metal is chemically treated before pouring to cause the formation of graphite  spheroids rather than flakes. This results in a stronger and more ductile iron, hence  its name. Applications include machinery components requiring high strength and  good wear resistance.  

White Cast Iron  This cast iron has less carbon and silicon than gray cast iron. It  is formed by more rapid cooling of the molten metal after pouring, thus causing the  carbon to remain chemically combined with iron in the form of cementite  $(\mathrm{Fe}_{3}\mathrm{C})$ ,  rather than precipitating out of solution in the form of flakes. When fractured, the  surface has a white crystalline appearance that gives the iron its name. Owing to  the cementite, white cast iron is hard and brittle, and its wear resistance is excellent.  Strength is good, with  TS  of $276\,\mathrm{MPa}$  ( $(40{,}000\;1\mathrm{b/in}^{2})$ ) being typical. These properties  make  white cast iron suitable for applications in which wear resistance is required.  Railway brake shoes are an example.  

Malleable Iron  When castings of white cast iron are heat treated to separate the  carbon out of solution and form graphite aggregates, the resulting metal is called  malleable iron. The new microstructure can possess substantial ductility (up to $20\%$ elongation)—a significant difference from the metal out of which it was transformed.  Typical products made of malleable cast iron include pipe fittings and flanges, certain  machine components, and railroad equipment parts.  

Alloy Cast Irons  Cast irons can be alloyed for special properties and applica-  tions. These alloy cast irons are classified as follows: (1) heat-treatable types that  can be hardened by martensite formation; (2) corrosion-resistant types, whose  alloying elements include nickel and chromium; and (3) heat-resistant types  containing high proportions of nickel for hot hardness and resistance to high  temperature oxidation.  

The nonferrous metals include metal elements and alloys not based on iron. The  most important engineering metals in the nonferrous group are aluminum, copper,  magnesium, nickel, titanium, and zinc, and their alloys.  

Although the nonferrous metals as a group cannot match the strength of the  steels, certain nonferrous alloys have corrosion resistance and/or strength-to- weight  ratios that make them competitive with steels in moderate-to-high stress applications.  In addition, many of the nonferrous metals have properties other than mechanical  that make them ideal for applications in which steel would be quite unsuitable.  For example, copper has one of the lowest electrical resistivities among metals and is  widely used for electrical wire. Aluminum is an excellent thermal conductor, and its  applications include heat exchangers and cooking pans. It is also one of the most  readily formed metals, and is valued for that reason also. Zinc has a relatively low  melting point, so zinc is widely used in die casting opera- tions. The common  nonferrous metals have their own combination of properties that make them  attractive in a variety of applications. The following nine sections cover the nonferrous  metals that are the most commercially and technologically important.

3.  Elastomers  are the rubbers. Elastomers (E) are polymers that exhibit extreme  elastic extensibility when subjected to relatively low mechanical stress. Some  elastomers can be stretched by a factor of 10 and yet completely recover to their  original shape. Although their properties are quite different from thermosets,  they have a similar molecular structure that is different from the thermoplastics.  

Thermoplastics are commercially the most important of the three types, constitut- ing around $70\%$  of the tonnage of all synthetic polymers produced. Thermosets and  elastomers share the remaining $30\%$  about evenly, with a slight edge for the former.  Common TP polymers include polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene,  poly  styrene, and nylon. Examples of TS polymers are phenolics, epoxies, and certain  polyesters. The most common example given for elastomers is natural (vulcanized)  rubber; however, synthetic rubbers exceed the tonnage of natural rubber.  

Although the classiﬁ  cation of polymers into the TP , TS, and E categories suits the  purpose of organizing the topic in this chapter, note that the three types sometimes  overlap. Certain polymers that are normally thermoplastic can be made into ther- mosets. Some polymers can be either thermosets or elastomers (recall that their  molecular structures are similar). And some elastomers are thermoplastic. However,  these are exceptions to the general classiﬁ  cation scheme.  

The growth in applications of synthetic polymers is truly impressive. On a volu- metric basis, current annual usage of polymers exceeds that of metals. There are  several reasons for the commercial and technological importance of polymers:  

$\succcurlyeq$ Plastics can be formed by molding into intricate part geometries, usually  with no further processing required. They are very compatible with  net shape processing.

 $\succcurlyeq$ Plastics possess an attractive list of properties for many engineering applications  where strength is not a factor: (1) low density relative to metals and ceramics; (2)  good strength-to-weight ratios for certain (but not all) polymers; (3) high corrosion  resistance; and (4) low electrical and thermal conductivity.

 $\succcurlyeq$ On a volumetric basis, polymers are cost competitive with metals.

 $\succcurlyeq$ On a volumetric basis, polymers generally require less energy to produce than  metals. This is generally true because the temperatures for working these materials  are much lower than for metals.

 $\succcurlyeq$ Certain plastics are translucent and/or transparent, which makes them competi- tive with glass in some applications.

 $\succcurlyeq$ Polymers are widely used in composite materials (Chapter 9).  

On the negative side, polymers in general have the following limitations: (1) strength  is low relative to metals and ceramics; (2) modulus of elasticity or stiffness is also low— in the case of elastomers, of course, this may be a desirable characteristic; (3) service  temperatures are limited to only a few hundred degrees because of the softening of  thermoplastic polymers or degradation of thermosetting polymers and elastomers;  (4) some polymers degrade when subjected to sunlight and other forms of radiation;  and (5) plastics exhibit viscoelastic properties (Section 3.5), which can be a distinct  limitation in load bearing applications.  

This chapter examines the technology of polymeric materials. The ﬁ  rst section is  devoted to an introductory discussion of polymer science and technology. Subsequent  sections survey the three basic categories of polymers: thermoplastics, thermosets,  and elastomers.  

# Fundamentals of Polymer Science  and Technology  

Polymers are synthesized by joining many small molecules together to form very  large molecules, called  macromolecules , that possess a chain-like structure. The  small units, called  monomers , are generally simple unsaturated organic molecules  such as ethylene  $\mathrm{C_{2}H_{4}}$ . This chapter examines the technology of polymeric materials.

# Fundamentals of Polymer Science  and Technology  

Polymers are synthesized by joining many small molecules together to form very  large molecules, called  macromolecules , that possess a chain-like structure. The  small units, called  monomers , are generally simple unsaturated organic molecules  such as ethylene  $\mathrm{C_{2}H_{4}}$ . The atoms in these molecules are held together by covalent  bonds; and when joined to form the polymer, the same covalent bonding holds the  links of the chain together. Thus, each large molecule is characterized by strong  primary bonding. Synthesis of the polyethylene molecule is depicted in Figure 8.1.

FIGURE 8.1  Synthesis  of polyethylene from  ethylene monomers: (1)  $n$  ethylene monomers  yields (2a) polyethylene  of chain length $n,$  (2b)  concise notation for  depicting the polymer  structure of chain  length $n$ .  

As its structure is described here, polyethylene is a linear polymer; its mers form  one long chain.  

A mass of polymer material consists of many macromolecules; the analogy of  a bowl of just-cooked spaghetti (without sauce) is sometimes used to visualize the  relationship of the individual molecules to the bulk material. Entanglement among  the long strands helps to hold the mass together, but atomic bonding is more signiﬁ  - cant. The bonding between macromolecules in the mass is due to van der Waals and  other secondary bonding types. Thus, the aggregate polymer material is held together  by forces that are substantially weaker than the primary bonds holding the molecules  together. This explains why plastics in general are not nearly as stiff and strong as  metals or ceramics.  

When a thermoplastic polymer is heated, it softens. The heat energy causes the  macromolecules to become thermally agitated, exciting them to move relative to each  other within the polymer mass (here, the wet spaghetti analogy loses its appeal). The  material begins to behave like a viscous liquid, viscosity decreasing (ﬂ  uidity increasing)  with rising temperature.  

The following discussion will expand on these opening remarks, tracing how poly- mers are synthesized and examining the characteristics of the materials that result  from the synthesis.  

# 8.1.1  POLYMERIZATION  

As a chemical process, the synthesis of polymers can occur by either of two methods:  (1) addition polymerization and (2) step polymerization. Production of a given poly- mer is generally associated with one method or the other.  

Addition Polymerization  In this process, exempliﬁ  ed by polyethylene, the double  bonds between carbon atoms in the ethylene monomers are induced to open so that  they join with other monomer molecules. The connections occur on both ends of  the expanding macromolecule, developing long chains of repeating mers. Because  of the way the molecules are formed, the process is also known as  chain poly- merization . It is initiated using a chemical catalyst (called an  initiator ) to open the  carbon double bond in some of the monomers. These monomers, which are now  highly reactive because of their unpaired electrons, then capture other monomers  to begin forming chains that are reactive. The chains propagate by capturing still  other monomers, one at a time, until large molecules have been produced and the  reaction is terminated. The process proceeds as indicated in Figure 8.2. The entire  polymerization reaction takes only seconds for any given macromolecule. How- ever, in the industrial process, it may take many minutes or even hours to complete  

! ➢   Finishing by painting or plating is not required (except in unusual circumstances)  for plastics.  

As discussed in Chapter 8, the two types of plastics are  thermoplastics  and  ther- mosets . The difference is that thermosets undergo a curing process during heating  and shaping, which causes a permanent chemical change ( cross-linking ) in their  molecular structure. Once they have been cured, they cannot be melted through  reheating. By contrast, thermoplastics do not cure, and their chemical structure  remains basically unchanged upon reheating even though they transform from solid  to ﬂ  uid. Of the two types, thermoplastics are by far the more important type com- mercially, comprising more than  $80\%$  of the total plastics tonnage.  

Plastic-shaping processes can be classiﬁ  ed as follows according to the result- ing product geometry: (1) continuous extruded products with constant cross sec- tion other than sheets, ﬁ  lms, and ﬁ  laments; (2) continuous sheets and ﬁ  lms; (3)  continuous ﬁ  laments (ﬁ  bers); (4) molded parts that are mostly solid; (5) hollow  molded parts with relatively thin walls; (6) discrete parts made of formed sheets  and ﬁ  lms; (7) castings; and (8) foamed products. This chapter examines each of  these categories. The most important processes commercially are those associ- ated with thermoplastics; the two processes of greatest signiﬁ  cance are extrusion  and injection molding. A brief history of plastic-shaping processes is presented in  Historical Note 13.1.  

Coverage of the plastic-shaping processes begins by examining the properties of  polymer melts, because nearly all of the thermoplastic shaping processes share the  common step of heating the plastic so that it ﬂ  ows.  

# Historical Note 13.1  Plastic shaping processes  

Equipment for shaping plastics evolved largely  from rubber processing technology. Noteworthy  among the early contributors was Edwin Chaffee, an  American who developed a two-roll steam-heated  mill for mixing additives into rubber around 1835  (Section 14.5.2). He was also responsible for a simi- lar device called a calender, which consists of a series  of heated rolls for coating rubber onto cloth (Section  13.3). Both machines are still used today for plastics  as well as rubbers.  

The ﬁ  rst extruders, dating from around 1845 in  England, were ram-driven machines for extruding  rubber and coating rubber onto electrical wire. The  trouble with ram-type extruders is that they oper- ate in an intermittent fashion. An extruder that could  operate continuously, especially for wire and cable  coating, was highly desirable. Although several indi- viduals worked with varying degrees of success on  a screw-type extruder (Section 13.2.1), Mathew Gray  in England is credited with the invention; his patent  is dated 1879. As thermoplastics were subsequently  developed, these screw extruders, originally designed  for rubber, were adapted. An extrusion machine spe- ciﬁ  cally designed for thermoplastics was introduced  in 1935.  

Injection molding machines for plastics were adap- tations of equipment designed for metal die casting  (Historical Note 11.2). Around 1872, John Hyatt, an im- portant ﬁ  gure in the development of plastics (Histori- cal Note 8.1), patented a molding machine speciﬁ  cally  for plastics. It was a plunger-type machine (Section  13.6.3). The injection molding machine in its modern  form was introduced in 1921, with semiautomatic  controls added in 1937 . Ram-type machines were the  standard in the plastic molding industry for many dec- ades, until the superiority of the reciprocating screw  machine, developed by William Willert in the United  States in 1952, became obvious.

#  Properties of Polymer Melts  

To shape a thermoplastic polymer it must be heated so that it softens to the consist- ency of a liquid. In this form, it is called a  polymer melt . Polymer melts exhibit several  unique properties and characteristics, considered in this section. The reason for this property is that TP polymers consist of linear (and/or  branched) macromolecules that do not cross-link when heated. By contrast, thermo- sets and elastomers undergo a chemical change when heated, which cross-links their  molecules and permanently sets these polymers.  

In truth, thermoplastics do deteriorate chemically with repeated heating and  cooling. In plastic molding, a distinction is made between new or  virgin  material,  and plastic that has been previously molded (e.g., sprues, defective parts) and there- fore has experienced thermal cycling. For some applications, only virgin material  is acceptable. Thermoplastic polymers also degrade gradually when subjected to  continuous elevated temperatures below  $T_{m}$ . This long-term effect is called  thermal  aging  and involves slow chemical deterioration. Some TP polymers are more suscep- tible to thermal aging than others, and for a given material the rate of deterioration  depends on temperature.  

Mechanical Properties  In the discussion of mechanical properties in Chapter  3, polymers were compared with metals and ceramics. The typical thermoplastic at  room temperature is characterized by the following: (1) much lower stiffness, the  modulus of elasticity being two (in some cases, three) orders of magnitude lower than  metals and ceramics; (2) lower tensile strength, about  $10\%$  of the metals; (3) much  lower hardness; and (4) greater ductility on average, but there is a tremendous range  of values, from $1\%$  elongation for polystyrene to $500\%$  or more for polypropylene.  

Mechanical properties of thermoplastics depend on temperature. The func- tional relationships must be discussed in the context of amorphous and crystal- line structures. Amorphous thermoplastics are rigid and glass-like below their glass  transition temperature $T_{g}$  and ﬂ  exible or rubber-like just above it. As temperature  increases above  $T_{g}$ , the polymer becomes increasingly soft, ﬁ  nally becoming a vis- cous ﬂ  uid (it never becomes a thin liquid due to its high molecular weight). The  effect on mechanical behavior can be portrayed as in Figure 8.11, in which mechan- ical behavior is deﬁ  ned as deformation resistance. This is analogous to modulus of  elasti  city but it allows us to observe the effect of temperature on the amorphous  polymer as it transitions from solid to liquid. Below  $T_{g}$ , the material is elastic and  strong. At  $T_{g}$ , a rather sudden drop in deformation resistance is observed as the  material transforms into its rubbery phase; its behavior is viscoelastic in this region.  As temperature increases, it gradually becomes more ﬂ  uid-like.  

A theoretical thermoplastic with  $100\%$  crystallinity would have a distinct melting  point  $T_{m}$  at which it transforms from solid to liquid, but would show no perceptible  $T_{g}$ point. Of course, real polymers have less than $100\%$  crystallinity. For partially crystal- lized polymers, the resistance to deformation is characterized by the curve that lies  between the two extremes, its position determined by the relative proportions of the

"Which one of the three polymer types does not involve cross- linking? (a) thermoplastics, (b) thermosets, or (c) elastomers.",Answer. (a),,A,"""Explanation"": Thermoplastics do not involve cross-linking in their molecular structure. They can be melted and reshaped repeatedly, which is a characteristic of materials that lack cross-linking. In contrast, thermosets and elastomers have cross-linked structures, which cause them to set permanently (thermosets) or provide elasticity (elastomers).

material into an infusible solid. If reheated, thermosetting polymers degrade and  char rather than soften.  

3.  Elastomers  are the rubbers. Elastomers (E) are polymers that exhibit extreme  elastic extensibility when subjected to relatively low mechanical stress. Some  elastomers can be stretched by a factor of 10 and yet completely recover to their  original shape. Although their properties are quite different from thermosets,  they have a similar molecular structure that is different from the thermoplastics.  

Thermoplastics are commercially the most important of the three types, constitut- ing around $70\%$  of the tonnage of all synthetic polymers produced. Thermosets and  elastomers share the remaining $30\%$  about evenly, with a slight edge for the former.  Common TP polymers include polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene,  poly  styrene, and nylon. Examples of TS polymers are phenolics, epoxies, and certain  polyesters. The most common example given for elastomers is natural (vulcanized)  rubber; however, synthetic rubbers exceed the tonnage of natural rubber.  

Although the classiﬁ  cation of polymers into the TP , TS, and E categories suits the  purpose of organizing the topic in this chapter, note that the three types sometimes  overlap. Certain polymers that are normally thermoplastic can be made into ther- mosets. Some polymers can be either thermosets or elastomers (recall that their  molecular structures are similar). And some elastomers are thermoplastic. However,  these are exceptions to the general classiﬁ  cation scheme.  

The growth in applications of synthetic polymers is truly impressive. On a volu- metric basis, current annual usage of polymers exceeds that of metals. There are  several reasons for the commercial and technological importance of polymers:  

$\succcurlyeq$ Plastics can be formed by molding into intricate part geometries, usually  with no further processing required. They are very compatible with  net shape processing.

 $\succcurlyeq$ Plastics possess an attractive list of properties for many engineering applications  where strength is not a factor: (1) low density relative to metals and ceramics; (2)  good strength-to-weight ratios for certain (but not all) polymers; (3) high corrosion  resistance; and (4) low electrical and thermal conductivity.

 $\succcurlyeq$ On a volumetric basis, polymers are cost competitive with metals.

 $\succcurlyeq$ On a volumetric basis, polymers generally require less energy to produce than  metals. This is generally true because the temperatures for working these materials  are much lower than for metals.

 $\succcurlyeq$ Certain plastics are translucent and/or transparent, which makes them competi- tive with glass in some applications.

 $\succcurlyeq$ Polymers are widely used in composite materials (Chapter 9).  

On the negative side, polymers in general have the following limitations: (1) strength  is low relative to metals and ceramics; (2) modulus of elasticity or stiffness is also low— in the case of elastomers, of course, this may be a desirable characteristic; (3) service  temperatures are limited to only a few hundred degrees because of the softening of  thermoplastic polymers or degradation of thermosetting polymers and elastomers;  (4) some polymers degrade when subjected to sunlight and other forms of radiation;  and (5) plastics exhibit viscoelastic properties (Section 3.5), which can be a distinct  limitation in load bearing applications.  

This chapter examines the technology of polymeric materials. The ﬁ  rst section is  devoted to an introductory discussion of polymer science and technology. Subsequent  sections survey the three basic categories of polymers: thermoplastics, thermosets,  and elastomers.  

# Fundamentals of Polymer Science  and Technology  

Polymers are synthesized by joining many small molecules together to form very  large molecules, called  macromolecules , that possess a chain-like structure. The  small units, called  monomers , are generally simple unsaturated organic molecules  such as ethylene  $\mathrm{C_{2}H_{4}}$ . Through variations in chemistry, cross-linking, and  processing, polyurethanes can be thermoplastic, thermosetting, or elastomeric mate- rials, the latter two being the most important commercially. The largest application  of polyurethane is in foams. These can range between elastomeric and rigid, the lat- ter being more highly cross-linked. Rigid foams are used as a ﬁ  ller material in hollow  construction panels and refrigerator walls. In these types of applications, the mate- rial provides excellent thermal insulation, adds rigidity to the structure, and does  not absorb water in signiﬁ  cant amounts. Many paints, varnishes, and similar coating  materials are based on urethane systems. Polyurethane elastomers are discussed in  Section 8.4.  

Silicones  Silicones are inorganic and semi-inorganic polymers, distinguished by  the presence of the repeating siloxane link  $(-\mathrm{Si}{-}\mathrm{O}{-})$  in their molecular structure.  A typical formulation combines the methyl radical  $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)$  with (SiO) in various  proportions to obtain the repeating unit– $\mathrm{((CH}_{3}\mathrm{)}_{m}\mathrm{-SiO)-}$ , where  $\pmb{m}$  establishes the  proportionality. By variations in composition and processing, polysiloxanes can be  produced in three forms: (1) ﬂ  uids, (2) elastomers, and (3) thermosetting resins.  Fluids are low molecular weight polymers used for lubricants, polishes, waxes, and  other liquid products—not really polymers in the sense of this chapter, but impor- tant commercially nevertheless. Silicone elastomers, covered in Section 8.4, and  thermosetting silicones, treated here, are cross-linked. When highly cross-linked,  polysiloxanes form rigid resin systems used for paints, varnishes, and other coat- ings; and laminates such as printed circuit boards. They are also used as molding  materials for electrical parts. Curing is accomplished by heating or by allowing  the solvents containing the polymers to evaporate. Silicones are noted for their  good heat resistance and water repellence, but their mechanical strength is not as  great as other cross-linked polymers. Data in Table $8.4(\mathrm{g})$  are for a typical silicone  thermosetting polymer.  

Elastomers are polymers capable of large elastic deformation when subjected to rel- atively low stresses. Some elastomers can withstand extensions of $500\%$  or more and  still return to their original shape. The more popular term for elastomer is, of course,  rubber. Rubbers can be divided into two categories: (1) natural rubber, derived from  certain biological plants; and (2) synthetic elastomers, produced by polymeriza- tion processes similar to those used for thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers.  Before discussing natural and synthetic rubbers, consider the general characteristics  of elastomers.

# 8.4.1  CHARACTERISTICS OF ELASTOMERS  

Elastomers consist of long-chain molecules that are cross-linked. They owe their  impressive elastic properties to the combination of two features: (1) the long mole- cules are tightly kinked when unstretched, and (2) the degree of cross-linking is sub- stantially below that of the thermosets. These features are illustrated in the model of  Figure 8.12(a), which shows a tightly kinked cross-linked molecule under no stress.  

When the material is stretched, the molecules are forced to uncoil and straighten  as shown in Figure 8.12(b). The molecules’ natural resistance to uncoiling provides  the initial elastic modulus of the aggregate material. ➢   Finishing by painting or plating is not required (except in unusual circumstances)  for plastics.  

As discussed in Chapter 8, the two types of plastics are  thermoplastics  and  ther- mosets . The difference is that thermosets undergo a curing process during heating  and shaping, which causes a permanent chemical change ( cross-linking ) in their  molecular structure. Once they have been cured, they cannot be melted through  reheating. By contrast, thermoplastics do not cure, and their chemical structure  remains basically unchanged upon reheating even though they transform from solid  to ﬂ  uid. Of the two types, thermoplastics are by far the more important type com- mercially, comprising more than  $80\%$  of the total plastics tonnage.  

Plastic-shaping processes can be classiﬁ  ed as follows according to the result- ing product geometry: (1) continuous extruded products with constant cross sec- tion other than sheets, ﬁ  lms, and ﬁ  laments; (2) continuous sheets and ﬁ  lms; (3)  continuous ﬁ  laments (ﬁ  bers); (4) molded parts that are mostly solid; (5) hollow  molded parts with relatively thin walls; (6) discrete parts made of formed sheets  and ﬁ  lms; (7) castings; and (8) foamed products. This chapter examines each of  these categories. The most important processes commercially are those associ- ated with thermoplastics; the two processes of greatest signiﬁ  cance are extrusion  and injection molding. A brief history of plastic-shaping processes is presented in  Historical Note 13.1.  

Coverage of the plastic-shaping processes begins by examining the properties of  polymer melts, because nearly all of the thermoplastic shaping processes share the  common step of heating the plastic so that it ﬂ  ows.  

# Historical Note 13.1  Plastic shaping processes  

Equipment for shaping plastics evolved largely  from rubber processing technology. Noteworthy  among the early contributors was Edwin Chaffee, an  American who developed a two-roll steam-heated  mill for mixing additives into rubber around 1835  (Section 14.5.2). He was also responsible for a simi- lar device called a calender, which consists of a series  of heated rolls for coating rubber onto cloth (Section  13.3). Both machines are still used today for plastics  as well as rubbers.  

The ﬁ  rst extruders, dating from around 1845 in  England, were ram-driven machines for extruding  rubber and coating rubber onto electrical wire. The  trouble with ram-type extruders is that they oper- ate in an intermittent fashion. An extruder that could  operate continuously, especially for wire and cable  coating, was highly desirable. Although several indi- viduals worked with varying degrees of success on  a screw-type extruder (Section 13.2.1), Mathew Gray  in England is credited with the invention; his patent  is dated 1879. As thermoplastics were subsequently  developed, these screw extruders, originally designed  for rubber, were adapted. An extrusion machine spe- ciﬁ  cally designed for thermoplastics was introduced  in 1935.  

Injection molding machines for plastics were adap- tations of equipment designed for metal die casting  (Historical Note 11.2). Around 1872, John Hyatt, an im- portant ﬁ  gure in the development of plastics (Histori- cal Note 8.1), patented a molding machine speciﬁ  cally  for plastics. It was a plunger-type machine (Section  13.6.3). The injection molding machine in its modern  form was introduced in 1921, with semiautomatic  controls added in 1937 . Ram-type machines were the  standard in the plastic molding industry for many dec- ades, until the superiority of the reciprocating screw  machine, developed by William Willert in the United  States in 1952, became obvious.  

#  Properties of Polymer Melts  

To shape a thermoplastic polymer it must be heated so that it softens to the consist- ency of a liquid. In this form, it is called a  polymer melt . Polymer melts exhibit several  unique properties and characteristics, considered in this section.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec8.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec8.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec13.txt","0.8509479414327411, 0.8398412285299024, 0.8397322003139503"
"As the degree of crystallinity in a given polymer increases, the polymer becomes denser and stiffer, and its melting temperature decreases: (a) true or (b) false.",Answer. (b) Melting temperature increases with higher degree of crystallinity.,,B,"""Explanation"": As the degree of crystallinity in a polymer increases, the polymer typically becomes denser and stiffer due to the more ordered arrangement of the molecular chains. This higher packing efficiency increases the specific gravity. The modulus of elasticity (stiffness) also increases as shown in the data for low-density and high-density polyethylene. However, the melting temperature increases with higher crystallinity, not decreases. The more crystalline structure requires higher thermal energy to disrupt the ordered molecular arrangement. Therefore, the statement that the melting temperature decreases is false.

""YourChoice"": ""B""","Many polymers  are transparent, but only in the amorphous (glassy) state. Some of these effects  can be illustrated by the differences between low-density and high-density poly- ethylene, presented in Table 8.2. The underlying reason for the property differences  between these materials is the degree of crystallinity.  

Linear polymers consist of long molecules with thousands of repeated mers. Crys- tallization in these polymers involves the folding back and forth of the long chains

upon themselves to achieve a very regular arrangement of the mers, as pictured in  Figure 8.9(a). The crystallized regions are called  crystallites . Owing to the tremen- dous length of a single molecule (on an atomic scale), it may participate in more than  one crystallite. Also, more than one molecule may be combined in a single crystal  region. The crystallites take the form of lamellae, as pictured in Figure 8.9(b), that are  randomly mixed in with the amorphous material. Thus, a polymer that crystallizes  is a two-phase system—crystallites interspersed throughout an amorphous matrix.  

A number of factors determine the capacity and/or tendency of a polymer to form  crystalline regions within the material. The factors can be summarized as follows:  (1) as a general rule, only linear polymers can form crystals; (2) stereo regularity of  the molecule is critical [15]: isotactic polymers always form crystals; syndiotactic poly- mers sometimes form crystals; atactic polymers never form crystals; (3) copolymers,  due to their molecular irregularity, rarely form crystals; (4) slower cooling promotes  crystal formation and growth, as it does in metals and ceramics; (5) mechanical defor- mation, as in the stretching of a heated thermoplastic, tends to align the structure and  increase crystallization; and (6) plasticizers (chemicals added to a polymer to soften  it) reduce the degree of crystallinity.  

# 8.1.4  THERMAL BEHAVIOR OF POLYMERS  

The thermal behavior of polymers with crystalline structures is different from that  of amorphous polymers (Section 2.4). The effect of structure can be observed on a  plot of speciﬁ  c volume (reciprocal of density) as a function of temperature, as plot- ted in Figure 8.10. A highly crystalline polymer has a melting point  $T_{m}$  at which its  volume undergoes an abrupt change. Also, at temperatures above  $T_{m}$ , the thermal  expansion of the molten material is greater than for the solid material below  $T_{m}$ . An  amorphous polymer does not undergo the same abrupt changes at  $T_{m}$ . As it is cooled  from the liquid, its coefﬁ  cient of thermal expansion continues to decline along the  

![](images/5a0b7a6b3926929d9dcf3ba098abc7a72398ecfe7855c97e5b5767d3b732501d.jpg)

same trajectory as when it was molten, and it becomes increasingly viscous with  decreasing temperature. During cooling below  $T_{m}$ , the polymer changes from liquid  to rubbery. As temperature continues to drop, a point is ﬁ  nally reached at which the  thermal expansion of the amorphous polymer suddenly becomes lower. An  amorphous polymer does not undergo the same abrupt changes at  $T_{m}$ . As it is cooled  from the liquid, its coefﬁ  cient of thermal expansion continues to decline along the

FIGURE 8.10  Behavior  of polymers as a func- tion of temperature.  

same trajectory as when it was molten, and it becomes increasingly viscous with  decreasing temperature. During cooling below  $T_{m}$ , the polymer changes from liquid  to rubbery. As temperature continues to drop, a point is ﬁ  nally reached at which the  thermal expansion of the amorphous polymer suddenly becomes lower. This is the  glass-transition temperature , $T_{g}$  (Section 3.5), seen as the change in slope. Below  $T_{g},$ ,  the material is hard and brittle.  

A partially crystallized polymer lies between these two extremes, as indicated  in Figure 8.10. It is an average of the amorphous and crystalline states, the average  depending on the degree of crystallinity. Above  $T_{m}$  it exhibits the viscous character- istics of a liquid; between  $T_{m}$  and $T_{g}$  it has viscoelastic properties; and below  $T_{g}$  it has  the conventional elastic properties of a solid.  

What is described in this section applies to thermoplastic materials, which can  move up and down the curve of Figure 8.10 multiple times. The manner in which they  are heated and cooled may change the path that is followed. For example, fast cool- ing rates may inhibit crystal formation and increase the glass-transition temperature.  Thermosets and elastomers cooled from the liquid state behave like an amorphous  polymer until cross-linking occurs. Their molecular structure restricts the formation  of crystals. And once their molecules are cross-linked, they cannot be reheated to the  molten state.  

# 8.1.5  ADDITIVES  

The properties of a polymer can often be beneﬁ  cially changed by combining them  with additives. Additives either alter the molecular structure of the polymer or add  a second phase to the plastic, in effect transforming a polymer into a composite mate- rial.  Additives can be classiﬁ  ed by function as (1) ﬁ  llers, (2) plasticizers, (3) colorants,  (4) lubricants, (5) ﬂ  ame retardants, (6) cross-linking agents, (7) ultraviolet light  absorbers, and (8) antioxidants.  

Filler   Fillers  are solid materials added to a polymer usually in particulate or ﬁ  brous  form to alter its mechanical properties or to simply reduce material cost. Other rea- sons for using ﬁ  llers are to improve dimensional and thermal stability. Examples  of ﬁ  llers used in polymers include cellulosic ﬁ  bers and powders (e.g., cotton ﬁ  bers  and wood ﬂ  our, respectively); powders of silica  $(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ , calcium carbonate  $(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3})$ ,  and clay (hydrous aluminum silicate); and ﬁ  bers of glass, metal, carbon, or other  polymers. Fillers that improve mechanical properties are called  reinforcing agents ,  and composites thus created are referred to as  reinforced plastics ; they have higher  stiffness, strength, hardness, and toughness than the original polymer. Fibers provide  the greatest strengthening effect.  

Plasticizers   Plasticizers  are chemicals added to a polymer to make it softer and  more ﬂ  exible, and to improve its ﬂ  ow characteristics during forming. The plasticizer  works by reducing the glass transition temperature to below room temperature.  Whereas the polymer is hard and brittle below Tg, it is soft and tough above it. Addi- tion of a plasticizer 1  to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a good example; depending on the  proportion of plasticizer in the mix, PVC can be obtained in a range of properties,  from rigid and brittle to ﬂ  exible and rubbery. two phases. The partially crystallized polymer exhibits features of both amorphous  and fully crystallized plastics. Below $T_{g}$ , it is elastic with deformation resistance sloping  downward with rising temperatures. Above  $T_{g},$ , the amorphous portions of the polymer  soften, while the crystalline portions remain intact. The bulk material exhibits pro- perties that are generally viscoelastic. As  $T_{m}$  is reached, the crystals now melt, giving  the polymer a liquid consistency; resistance to deformation is now due to the ﬂ  uid’s  viscous properties. The degree to which the polymer assumes liquid characteristics at  and above  $T_{m}$  depends on molecular weight and degree of polymerization. Higher DP  and MW reduces ﬂ  ow of the polymer, making it more difﬁ  cult to process by molding  and similar shaping methods.  This is a dilemma faced by those who select these materials  because higher MW and DP mean higher strength.  

Physical Properties  Physical properties of materials are discussed in Chapter 4. In  general, thermoplastic polymers have the following characteristics: (1) lower densi- ties than metals or ceramics—typical speciﬁ  c gravities for polymers are around 1.2,  for ceramics around 2.5, and for metals around 7.0; (2) much higher coefﬁ  cient of  thermal expansion—roughly ﬁ  ve times the value for metals and 10 times the value  for ceramics; (3) much lower melting temperatures; (4) speciﬁ  c heats that are two to  four times those of metals and ceramics; (5) thermal conductivities that are about  three orders of magnitude lower than those of metals; and (6) insulating electrical  properties.  

# 8.2.2  IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL THERMOPLASTICS  

Thermoplastic products include molded and extruded items, ﬁ  bers, ﬁ  lms, sheets, pack- aging materials, paints, and varnishes. The starting raw materials for these products are  normally supplied to the fabricator in the form of powders or pellets in bags, drums,  or larger loads by truck or rail car. The most important TP polymers are discussed in  alphabetical order in this section. For each plastic, Table 8.3 lists the chemical formula  and selected properties. Approximate market share is given relative to all plastics  (thermoplastic and thermosetting).

a Table 8.3 is compiled from [2], [4], [6], [7], [9], [16], and other sources.  

Acetals   Acetal  is the popular name given to  poly oxy methylene , an engineering  polymer prepared from formaldehyde  $\mathrm{(CH_{2}O)}$  with high stiffness, strength, toughness,  and wear resistance. In addition, it has a high melting point, low moisture absorption,  and is insoluble in common solvents at ambient temperatures. Because of this combi- nation of properties, acetal resins are competitive with certain metals (e.g., brass and  zinc) in automotive components such as door handles, pump housings, and similar  parts; appliance hardware; and machinery components.  

Acrylics  The acrylics are polymers derived from acrylic acid  $(\mathrm{C}_{3}\mathrm{H}_{4}\mathrm{O}_{2})$  and com- pounds originating from it. The most important thermoplastic in the acrylics group  is  poly methyl meth a cry late  (PMMA) or Plexiglas (Rohm & Haas’s trade name for  PMMA). Data on PMMA are listed in Table 8.3(b). It is an amorphous linear poly- mer. Its outstanding property is excellent transparency, which makes it competitive  with glass in optical applications. Examples include automotive tail-light lenses,  optical instruments, and aircraft windows. Its limitation when compared with glass  is a much lower scratch resistance. Other uses of PMMA include ﬂ  oor waxes and  emulsion latex paints.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec8.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec8.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec8.txt","0.8612343624667396, 0.8524635259211906, 0.8420529230047156"

The chemical formula for ethylene is C2H4. Therefore, the repeating unit in polyethylene is based on this monomer."", ""YourChoice"": ""B""","Copolymers  are polymers whose molecules are made of repeating  units of two different types. An example is the copolymer synthesized from ethylene  and propylene to produce a copolymer with elastomeric properties. The ethylene- propylene copolymer can be represented as follows:  

$$
-(\mathrm{C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{4})_{n}\left(\mathrm{C}_{3}\mathrm{H}_{6}\right)_{m}-
$$  

where $n$  and $m$  range between 10 and 20, and the proportions of the two constituents are  around  $50\%$  each. For example, the combination of polyethylene and poly  propylene  with small amounts of diene is an important synthetic rubber (Section 8.4.3).  

Copolymers can possess different arrangements of their constituent mers. The  possibilities are shown in Figure 8.8: (a)  alternating copolymer , in which the mers  repeat every other place; (b)  random , in which the mers are in random order, the fre- quency depending on the relative proportions of the starting monomers; (c)  block ,  in which mers of the same type tend to group themselves into long segments along  the chain; and (d)  graft , in which mers of one type are attached as branches to a  main backbone of mers of the other type. The ethylene–propylene diene rubber,  mentioned previously, is a block type.

Synthesis of copolymers is analogous to alloying of metals to form solid solutions.  As with metallic alloys, differences in the ingredients and structure of copolymers can  have a substantial effect on properties. An example is the polyethylene–polypropylene  mixture discussed above. Each of these polymers alone is fairly stiff; yet a 50–50 mix- ture forms a copolymer of random structure that is rubbery.  

It is also possible to synthesize  ternary polymers , or  terpolymers , which consist of  mers of three different types. An example is the plastic ABS (acrylonitrile–butadiene– styrene—no wonder they call it ABS).  

# 8.1.3  CRYSTALLINITY  

Both amorphous and crystalline structures are possible with polymers, although  the tendency to crystallize is much less than for metals or nonglass ceramics. Not  all poly  mers can form crystals. For those that can, the  degree of crystallinity  (the  propor  tion of crystallized material in the mass) is always less than $100\%$ . As crystal- linity is increased in a polymer, so are (1) density, (2) stiffness, strength, and tough- ness, and (3) heat resistance. In addition, (4) if the polymer is transparent in the  amorphous state, it becomes opaque when partially crystallized. Many polymers  are transparent, but only in the amorphous (glassy) state. Some of these effects  can be illustrated by the differences between low-density and high-density poly- ethylene, presented in Table 8.2. The underlying reason for the property differences  between these materials is the degree of crystallinity.

In its isotactic form, it is strong and melts at $175^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\left(347^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\right)$ ; the syndiot  actic  structure is also strong, but melts at  $131^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(268^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ; but atactic polypropylene is soft  and melts at around $75^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\left(165^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\right)$  and has little commercial use [6], [9].  

Linear, Branched, and Cross-Linked Polymers  The polymerization process has  been described as yielding macromolecules of a chain-like structure, called a  linear  polymer . This is the characteristic structure of a thermoplastic polymer. Other struc- tures are possible, as portrayed in Figure 8.7. One possibility is for side branches  to form along the chain, resulting in the  branched polymer  shown in Figure 8.7(b).  In polyethylene, this occurs because hydrogen atoms are replaced by carbon atoms  at random points along the chain, initiating the growth of a branch chain at each  location. For certain polymers, primary bonding occurs between branches and other  molecules at certain connection points to form  cross-linked polymers  as pictured in  Figure 8.7(c) and (d). Cross-linking occurs because a certain proportion of the mono- mers used to form the polymer are capable of bonding to adjacent monomers on  more than two sides, thus allowing branches from other molecules to attach. Lightly  cross-linked structures are characteristic of elastomers. When the polymer is highly  cross-linked, this is referred to as  network structure , as in (d); in effect, the entire mass  is one gigantic macro  molecule. Thermosetting plastics take this structure after curing.  

The presence of branching and cross-linking in polymers has a signiﬁ  cant effect on  properties. It is the basis of the difference between the three categories of polymers:  TP , TS, and E. Thermoplastic polymers always possess linear or branched structures,  or a mixture of the two. Branching increases entanglement among the molecules,  usually making the polymer stronger in the solid state and more viscous at a given  temperature in the plastic or liquid state.  

Thermosetting plastics and elastomers are cross-linked polymers. Cross-linking  causes the polymer to become chemically set; the reaction cannot be reversed.

FIGURE 8.7  Various structures of polymer molecules: (a) linear, characteristic of thermoplastics; (b) branched; (c)  loosely cross-linked as in an elastomer; and (d) tightly cross-linked or networked structure as in a thermoset.  

The effect is to permanently change the structure of the polymer; upon heating,  it degrades or burns rather than melts. Thermosets possess a high degree of cross- linking, while elastomers possess a low degree of cross-linking. Thermosets are hard  and brittle, while elastomers are elastic and resilient.  

Copolymers  Polyethylene is a  homopolymer ; so are polypropylene, polystyrene,  and many other common plastics; their molecules consist of repeating mers that are  all the same type.  Copolymers  are polymers whose molecules are made of repeating  units of two different types. An example is the copolymer synthesized from ethylene  and propylene to produce a copolymer with elastomeric properties. The ethylene- propylene copolymer can be represented as follows:  

$$
-(\mathrm{C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{4})_{n}\left(\mathrm{C}_{3}\mathrm{H}_{6}\right)_{m}-
$$  

where $n$  and $m$  range between 10 and 20, and the proportions of the two constituents are  around  $50\%$  each. For example, the combination of polyethylene and poly  propylene  with small amounts of diene is an important synthetic rubber (Section 8.4.3).  

Copolymers can possess different arrangements of their constituent mers. Since $n$  varies for different molecules in a batch, the molecule weight must be  interpreted as an average. Typical values of DP and MW for selected polymers are  presented in Table 8.1.

Linear, Branched, and Cross-Linked Polymers  The polymerization process has  been described as yielding macromolecules of a chain-like structure, called a  linear  polymer . This is the characteristic structure of a thermoplastic polymer. As the reac- tion continues, more molecules of the reactants combine with the molecules ﬁ  rst  synthesized to form polymers of length $n=2$ , then polymers of length  $n=3$ , and  so on. Polymers of increasing n are created in a slow, stepwise fashion. In addition  to this gradual elongation of the molecules, intermediate polymers of length $n_{1}$  and  $n_{2}$  also combine to form molecules of length $n=n_{1}+n_{2}$ , so that two types of reac- tions are proceeding simultaneously once the process is under way, as illustrated  in Figure 8.4. Accordingly, at any point in the process, the batch contains polymers  of various lengths. Only after sufﬁ  cient time has elapsed are molecules of adequate  length formed.  

It should be noted that water is not always the byproduct of the reaction; for  example, ammonia  $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)$  is another simple compound produced in some reac- tions. Nevertheless, the term condensation polymerization is still used. It should  also be noted that although most step polymerization processes involve condensa- tion of a byproduct, some do not. Examples of commercial polymers produced by  step (conden  sation) polymerization are given in Figure 8.5. Both thermoplastic and  thermosetting polymers are synthesized by this method; nylon-6,6 and polycarbonate  are TP polymers, while phenol formaldehyde and urea formaldehyde are TS polymers.  

Degree of Polymerization and Molecular Weight  A macromolecule produced  by polymerization consists of  $n$  repeating mers. Since molecules in a given batch  of polymerized material vary in length,  $n$  for the batch is an average; its statistical  distribution is normal. The mean value of  $n$  is called the  degree of polymerization   (DP) for the batch. The degree of polymerization affects the properties of the poly- mer: higher DP increases mechanical strength but also increases viscosity in the ﬂ  uid  state, which makes processing more difﬁ  cult.  

The  molecular weight  (MW) of a polymer is the sum of the molecular weights  of the mers in the molecule; it is n times the molecular weight of each repeating  unit. Since $n$  varies for different molecules in a batch, the molecule weight must be  interpreted as an average. Typical values of DP and MW for selected polymers are  presented in Table 8.1.  

TABLE •  8.1  Typical values of degree of polymerization and molecular weight for  selected thermoplastic polymers.

Compiled from [7]. The connections occur on both ends of  the expanding macromolecule, developing long chains of repeating mers. Because  of the way the molecules are formed, the process is also known as  chain poly- merization . It is initiated using a chemical catalyst (called an  initiator ) to open the  carbon double bond in some of the monomers. These monomers, which are now  highly reactive because of their unpaired electrons, then capture other monomers  to begin forming chains that are reactive. The chains propagate by capturing still  other monomers, one at a time, until large molecules have been produced and the  reaction is terminated. The process proceeds as indicated in Figure 8.2. The entire  polymerization reaction takes only seconds for any given macromolecule. How- ever, in the industrial process, it may take many minutes or even hours to complete

the polymerization of a given batch, since all of the chain reactions do not occur  simultaneously in the mixture.  

Other polymers typically formed by addition polymerization are presented in  Figure 8.3, along with the starting monomer and the repeating mer. Note that the  chemical formula for the monomer is the same as that of the mer in the polymer.  This is a characteristic of this method of polymerization. Note also that many of  the common polymers involve substitution of some alternative atom or molecule in  place of one of the H atoms in polyethylene. Polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, and  polystyrene are examples of this substitution. Polytetraﬂ  uoroethylene replaces all  four H atoms in the structure with atoms of ﬂ  uorine (F). Most addition polymers are  thermoplastics. The exception in Figure 8.3 is polyisoprene, the polymer of natural  rubber. Although formed by addition polymerization, it is an elastomer.

Step Polymerization  In this form of polymerization, two reacting monomers are  brought together to form a new molecule of the desired compound. In most (but  not all) step polymerization processes, a byproduct of the reaction is also produced.  The byproduct is typically water, which condenses; hence, the term  condensation  polymerization  is often used for processes that yield the condensate.

Copolymers  Polyethylene is a  homopolymer ; so are polypropylene, polystyrene,  and many other common plastics; their molecules consist of repeating mers that are  all the same type.  Copolymers  are polymers whose molecules are made of repeating  units of two different types. An example is the copolymer synthesized from ethylene  and propylene to produce a copolymer with elastomeric properties. The ethylene- propylene copolymer can be represented as follows:  

$$
-(\mathrm{C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{4})_{n}\left(\mathrm{C}_{3}\mathrm{H}_{6}\right)_{m}-
$$  

where $n$  and $m$  range between 10 and 20, and the proportions of the two constituents are  around  $50\%$  each. For example, the combination of polyethylene and poly  propylene  with small amounts of diene is an important synthetic rubber (Section 8.4.3).  

Copolymers can possess different arrangements of their constituent mers. Many polymers  are transparent, but only in the amorphous (glassy) state. Some of these effects  can be illustrated by the differences between low-density and high-density poly- ethylene, presented in Table 8.2. The underlying reason for the property differences  between these materials is the degree of crystallinity.  

Linear polymers consist of long molecules with thousands of repeated mers. Crys- tallization in these polymers involves the folding back and forth of the long chains

upon themselves to achieve a very regular arrangement of the mers, as pictured in  Figure 8.9(a). The crystallized regions are called  crystallites . Owing to the tremen- dous length of a single molecule (on an atomic scale), it may participate in more than  one crystallite. Also, more than one molecule may be combined in a single crystal  region. The crystallites take the form of lamellae, as pictured in Figure 8.9(b), that are  randomly mixed in with the amorphous material. Thus, a polymer that crystallizes  is a two-phase system—crystallites interspersed throughout an amorphous matrix.  

A number of factors determine the capacity and/or tendency of a polymer to form  crystalline regions within the material. The factors can be summarized as follows:  (1) as a general rule, only linear polymers can form crystals; (2) stereo regularity of  the molecule is critical [15]: isotactic polymers always form crystals; syndiotactic poly- mers sometimes form crystals; atactic polymers never form crystals; (3) copolymers,  due to their molecular irregularity, rarely form crystals; (4) slower cooling promotes  crystal formation and growth, as it does in metals and ceramics; (5) mechanical defor- mation, as in the stretching of a heated thermoplastic, tends to align the structure and  increase crystallization; and (6) plasticizers (chemicals added to a polymer to soften  it) reduce the degree of crystallinity.  

# 8.1.4  THERMAL BEHAVIOR OF POLYMERS  

The thermal behavior of polymers with crystalline structures is different from that  of amorphous polymers (Section 2.4). The effect of structure can be observed on a  plot of speciﬁ  c volume (reciprocal of density) as a function of temperature, as plot- ted in Figure 8.10. A highly crystalline polymer has a melting point  $T_{m}$  at which its  volume undergoes an abrupt change. Also, at temperatures above  $T_{m}$ , the thermal  expansion of the molten material is greater than for the solid material below  $T_{m}$ . An  amorphous polymer does not undergo the same abrupt changes at  $T_{m}$ . As it is cooled  from the liquid, its coefﬁ  cient of thermal expansion continues to decline along the  

![](images/5a0b7a6b3926929d9dcf3ba098abc7a72398ecfe7855c97e5b5767d3b732501d.jpg)

same trajectory as when it was molten, and it becomes increasingly viscous with  decreasing temperature. During cooling below  $T_{m}$ , the polymer changes from liquid  to rubbery. As temperature continues to drop, a point is ﬁ  nally reached at which the  thermal expansion of the amorphous polymer suddenly becomes lower. An  amorphous polymer does not undergo the same abrupt changes at  $T_{m}$ . As it is cooled  from the liquid, its coefﬁ  cient of thermal expansion continues to decline along the

FIGURE 8.10  Behavior  of polymers as a func- tion of temperature.  

same trajectory as when it was molten, and it becomes increasingly viscous with  decreasing temperature. During cooling below  $T_{m}$ , the polymer changes from liquid  to rubbery. As temperature continues to drop, a point is ﬁ  nally reached at which the  thermal expansion of the amorphous polymer suddenly becomes lower. This is the  glass-transition temperature , $T_{g}$  (Section 3.5), seen as the change in slope. Below  $T_{g},$ ,  the material is hard and brittle.  

A partially crystallized polymer lies between these two extremes, as indicated  in Figure 8.10. It is an average of the amorphous and crystalline states, the average  depending on the degree of crystallinity. Above  $T_{m}$  it exhibits the viscous character- istics of a liquid; between  $T_{m}$  and $T_{g}$  it has viscoelastic properties; and below  $T_{g}$  it has  the conventional elastic properties of a solid.  

What is described in this section applies to thermoplastic materials, which can  move up and down the curve of Figure 8.10 multiple times. The manner in which they  are heated and cooled may change the path that is followed. For example, fast cool- ing rates may inhibit crystal formation and increase the glass-transition temperature.  Thermosets and elastomers cooled from the liquid state behave like an amorphous  polymer until cross-linking occurs. Their molecular structure restricts the formation  of crystals. And once their molecules are cross-linked, they cannot be reheated to the  molten state.  

# 8.1.5  ADDITIVES  

The properties of a polymer can often be beneﬁ  cially changed by combining them  with additives. Additives either alter the molecular structure of the polymer or add  a second phase to the plastic, in effect transforming a polymer into a composite mate- rial.  Additives can be classiﬁ  ed by function as (1) ﬁ  llers, (2) plasticizers, (3) colorants,  (4) lubricants, (5) ﬂ  ame retardants, (6) cross-linking agents, (7) ultraviolet light  absorbers, and (8) antioxidants.  

Filler   Fillers  are solid materials added to a polymer usually in particulate or ﬁ  brous  form to alter its mechanical properties or to simply reduce material cost. Other rea- sons for using ﬁ  llers are to improve dimensional and thermal stability. Examples  of ﬁ  llers used in polymers include cellulosic ﬁ  bers and powders (e.g., cotton ﬁ  bers  and wood ﬂ  our, respectively); powders of silica  $(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ , calcium carbonate  $(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3})$ ,  and clay (hydrous aluminum silicate); and ﬁ  bers of glass, metal, carbon, or other  polymers. Fillers that improve mechanical properties are called  reinforcing agents ,  and composites thus created are referred to as  reinforced plastics ; they have higher  stiffness, strength, hardness, and toughness than the original polymer. Fibers provide  the greatest strengthening effect.  

Plasticizers   Plasticizers  are chemicals added to a polymer to make it softer and  more ﬂ  exible, and to improve its ﬂ  ow characteristics during forming. The plasticizer  works by reducing the glass transition temperature to below room temperature.  Whereas the polymer is hard and brittle below Tg, it is soft and tough above it. Addi- tion of a plasticizer 1  to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a good example; depending on the  proportion of plasticizer in the mix, PVC can be obtained in a range of properties,  from rigid and brittle to ﬂ  exible and rubbery.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec8.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec8.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec8.txt","0.8390993479386573, 0.8378543082080094, 0.8217092889139891"

where $n$  and $m$  range between 10 and 20, and the proportions of the two constituents are  around  $50\%$  each. For example, the combination of polyethylene and poly  propylene  with small amounts of diene is an important synthetic rubber (Section 8.4.3).

Synthesis of copolymers is analogous to alloying of metals to form solid solutions.  As with metallic alloys, differences in the ingredients and structure of copolymers can  have a substantial effect on properties. An example is the polyethylene–polypropylene  mixture discussed above. Each of these polymers alone is fairly stiff; yet a 50–50 mix- ture forms a copolymer of random structure that is rubbery.  

It is also possible to synthesize  ternary polymers , or  terpolymers , which consist of  mers of three different types. An example is the plastic ABS (acrylonitrile–butadiene– styrene—no wonder they call it ABS).  

# 8.1.3  CRYSTALLINITY  

Both amorphous and crystalline structures are possible with polymers, although  the tendency to crystallize is much less than for metals or nonglass ceramics. Not  all poly  mers can form crystals. For those that can, the  degree of crystallinity  (the  propor  tion of crystallized material in the mass) is always less than $100\%$ . As crystal- linity is increased in a polymer, so are (1) density, (2) stiffness, strength, and tough- ness, and (3) heat resistance. In addition, (4) if the polymer is transparent in the  amorphous state, it becomes opaque when partially crystallized. Many polymers  are transparent, but only in the amorphous (glassy) state. Some of these effects  can be illustrated by the differences between low-density and high-density poly- ethylene, presented in Table 8.2. The underlying reason for the property differences  between these materials is the degree of crystallinity.  

Linear polymers consist of long molecules with thousands of repeated mers. Crys- tallization in these polymers involves the folding back and forth of the long chains

! This chapter examines the technology of polymeric materials. The ﬁ  rst section is  devoted to an introductory discussion of polymer science and technology. Subsequent  sections survey the three basic categories of polymers: thermoplastics, thermosets,  and elastomers.  

# Fundamentals of Polymer Science  and Technology  

Polymers are synthesized by joining many small molecules together to form very  large molecules, called  macromolecules , that possess a chain-like structure. The  small units, called  monomers , are generally simple unsaturated organic molecules  such as ethylene  $\mathrm{C_{2}H_{4}}$ . The atoms in these molecules are held together by covalent  bonds; and when joined to form the polymer, the same covalent bonding holds the  links of the chain together. Thus, each large molecule is characterized by strong  primary bonding. Synthesis of the polyethylene molecule is depicted in Figure 8.1.  

![](images/fcb94c83543dd234545daaa6f61779936e9af16f2968c07210dadc77d14e743f.jpg)  
FIGURE 8.1  Synthesis  of polyethylene from  ethylene monomers: (1)  $n$  ethylene monomers  yields (2a) polyethylene  of chain length $n,$  (2b)  concise notation for  depicting the polymer  structure of chain  length $n$ .  

As its structure is described here, polyethylene is a linear polymer; its mers form  one long chain.  

A mass of polymer material consists of many macromolecules; the analogy of  a bowl of just-cooked spaghetti (without sauce) is sometimes used to visualize the  relationship of the individual molecules to the bulk material. Entanglement among  the long strands helps to hold the mass together, but atomic bonding is more signiﬁ  - cant. The bonding between macromolecules in the mass is due to van der Waals and  other secondary bonding types. Thus, the aggregate polymer material is held together  by forces that are substantially weaker than the primary bonds holding the molecules  together. This explains why plastics in general are not nearly as stiff and strong as  metals or ceramics.  

When a thermoplastic polymer is heated, it softens. The heat energy causes the  macromolecules to become thermally agitated, exciting them to move relative to each  other within the polymer mass (here, the wet spaghetti analogy loses its appeal). The  material begins to behave like a viscous liquid, viscosity decreasing (ﬂ  uidity increasing)  with rising temperature.  

The following discussion will expand on these opening remarks, tracing how poly- mers are synthesized and examining the characteristics of the materials that result  from the synthesis.  

# 8.1.1  POLYMERIZATION  

As a chemical process, the synthesis of polymers can occur by either of two methods:  (1) addition polymerization and (2) step polymerization. Production of a given poly- mer is generally associated with one method or the other.  

Addition Polymerization  In this process, exempliﬁ  ed by polyethylene, the double  bonds between carbon atoms in the ethylene monomers are induced to open so that  they join with other monomer molecules. The connections occur on both ends of  the expanding macromolecule, developing long chains of repeating mers. Because  of the way the molecules are formed, the process is also known as  chain poly- merization . It is initiated using a chemical catalyst (called an  initiator ) to open the  carbon double bond in some of the monomers. These monomers, which are now  highly reactive because of their unpaired electrons, then capture other monomers  to begin forming chains that are reactive. The chains propagate by capturing still  other monomers, one at a time, until large molecules have been produced and the  reaction is terminated. The process proceeds as indicated in Figure 8.2. The entire  polymerization reaction takes only seconds for any given macromolecule. How- ever, in the industrial process, it may take many minutes or even hours to complete  

! In its isotactic form, it is strong and melts at $175^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\left(347^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\right)$ ; the syndiot  actic  structure is also strong, but melts at  $131^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(268^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ; but atactic polypropylene is soft  and melts at around $75^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\left(165^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\right)$  and has little commercial use [6], [9].  

Linear, Branched, and Cross-Linked Polymers  The polymerization process has  been described as yielding macromolecules of a chain-like structure, called a  linear  polymer . This is the characteristic structure of a thermoplastic polymer. Other struc- tures are possible, as portrayed in Figure 8.7. One possibility is for side branches  to form along the chain, resulting in the  branched polymer  shown in Figure 8.7(b).  In polyethylene, this occurs because hydrogen atoms are replaced by carbon atoms  at random points along the chain, initiating the growth of a branch chain at each  location. For certain polymers, primary bonding occurs between branches and other  molecules at certain connection points to form  cross-linked polymers  as pictured in  Figure 8.7(c) and (d). Cross-linking occurs because a certain proportion of the mono- mers used to form the polymer are capable of bonding to adjacent monomers on  more than two sides, thus allowing branches from other molecules to attach. Lightly  cross-linked structures are characteristic of elastomers. When the polymer is highly  cross-linked, this is referred to as  network structure , as in (d); in effect, the entire mass  is one gigantic macro  molecule. Thermosetting plastics take this structure after curing.  

The presence of branching and cross-linking in polymers has a signiﬁ  cant effect on  properties. It is the basis of the difference between the three categories of polymers:  TP , TS, and E. Thermoplastic polymers always possess linear or branched structures,  or a mixture of the two. Branching increases entanglement among the molecules,  usually making the polymer stronger in the solid state and more viscous at a given  temperature in the plastic or liquid state.  

Thermosetting plastics and elastomers are cross-linked polymers. Cross-linking  causes the polymer to become chemically set; the reaction cannot be reversed.

FIGURE 8.7  Various structures of polymer molecules: (a) linear, characteristic of thermoplastics; (b) branched; (c)  loosely cross-linked as in an elastomer; and (d) tightly cross-linked or networked structure as in a thermoset.  

The effect is to permanently change the structure of the polymer; upon heating,  it degrades or burns rather than melts. Thermosets possess a high degree of cross- linking, while elastomers possess a low degree of cross-linking. Thermosets are hard  and brittle, while elastomers are elastic and resilient.  

Copolymers  Polyethylene is a  homopolymer ; so are polypropylene, polystyrene,  and many other common plastics; their molecules consist of repeating mers that are  all the same type.  Copolymers  are polymers whose molecules are made of repeating  units of two different types. An example is the copolymer synthesized from ethylene  and propylene to produce a copolymer with elastomeric properties. The ethylene- propylene copolymer can be represented as follows:  

$$
-(\mathrm{C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{4})_{n}\left(\mathrm{C}_{3}\mathrm{H}_{6}\right)_{m}-
$$  

where $n$  and $m$  range between 10 and 20, and the proportions of the two constituents are  around  $50\%$  each. For example, the combination of polyethylene and poly  propylene  with small amounts of diene is an important synthetic rubber (Section 8.4.3).  

Copolymers can possess different arrangements of their constituent mers.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec8.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec8.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec8.txt","0.8647648844062061, 0.8310027843319892, 0.8261639044753274"
"As temperature of a polymer increases, its density (a) increases, (b) decreases, or (c) remains fairly constant.",Answer. (b),,B,"""Explanation"": As the temperature of a polymer increases, its specific volume increases, meaning the polymer expands, which causes its density to decrease. This behavior is outlined in the context, particularly in Figure 8.10, which shows how the specific volume of a polymer increases with temperature. Hence, the density decreases as a result of the increased temperature.

FIGURE 8.9  Crystallized regions in a polymer: (a) long molecules forming crystals randomly mixed in with the  amorphous material; and (b) folded chain lamella, the typical form of a crystallized region.  

upon themselves to achieve a very regular arrangement of the mers, as pictured in  Figure 8.9(a). The crystallized regions are called  crystallites . Owing to the tremen- dous length of a single molecule (on an atomic scale), it may participate in more than  one crystallite. Also, more than one molecule may be combined in a single crystal  region. The crystallites take the form of lamellae, as pictured in Figure 8.9(b), that are  randomly mixed in with the amorphous material. Thus, a polymer that crystallizes  is a two-phase system—crystallites interspersed throughout an amorphous matrix.  

A number of factors determine the capacity and/or tendency of a polymer to form  crystalline regions within the material. The factors can be summarized as follows:  (1) as a general rule, only linear polymers can form crystals; (2) stereo regularity of  the molecule is critical [15]: isotactic polymers always form crystals; syndiotactic poly- mers sometimes form crystals; atactic polymers never form crystals; (3) copolymers,  due to their molecular irregularity, rarely form crystals; (4) slower cooling promotes  crystal formation and growth, as it does in metals and ceramics; (5) mechanical defor- mation, as in the stretching of a heated thermoplastic, tends to align the structure and  increase crystallization; and (6) plasticizers (chemicals added to a polymer to soften  it) reduce the degree of crystallinity.  

# 8.1.4  THERMAL BEHAVIOR OF POLYMERS  

The thermal behavior of polymers with crystalline structures is different from that  of amorphous polymers (Section 2.4). The effect of structure can be observed on a  plot of speciﬁ  c volume (reciprocal of density) as a function of temperature, as plot- ted in Figure 8.10. A highly crystalline polymer has a melting point  $T_{m}$  at which its  volume undergoes an abrupt change. Also, at temperatures above  $T_{m}$ , the thermal  expansion of the molten material is greater than for the solid material below  $T_{m}$ . An  amorphous polymer does not undergo the same abrupt changes at  $T_{m}$ . As it is cooled  from the liquid, its coefﬁ  cient of thermal expansion continues to decline along the  

![](images/5a0b7a6b3926929d9dcf3ba098abc7a72398ecfe7855c97e5b5767d3b732501d.jpg)

same trajectory as when it was molten, and it becomes increasingly viscous with  decreasing temperature. During cooling below  $T_{m}$ , the polymer changes from liquid  to rubbery. As temperature continues to drop, a point is ﬁ  nally reached at which the  thermal expansion of the amorphous polymer suddenly becomes lower. An  amorphous polymer does not undergo the same abrupt changes at  $T_{m}$ . As it is cooled  from the liquid, its coefﬁ  cient of thermal expansion continues to decline along the

FIGURE 8.10  Behavior  of polymers as a func- tion of temperature.  

same trajectory as when it was molten, and it becomes increasingly viscous with  decreasing temperature. During cooling below  $T_{m}$ , the polymer changes from liquid  to rubbery. As temperature continues to drop, a point is ﬁ  nally reached at which the  thermal expansion of the amorphous polymer suddenly becomes lower. This is the  glass-transition temperature , $T_{g}$  (Section 3.5), seen as the change in slope. Below  $T_{g},$ ,  the material is hard and brittle.  

A partially crystallized polymer lies between these two extremes, as indicated  in Figure 8.10. It is an average of the amorphous and crystalline states, the average  depending on the degree of crystallinity. Above  $T_{m}$  it exhibits the viscous character- istics of a liquid; between  $T_{m}$  and $T_{g}$  it has viscoelastic properties; and below  $T_{g}$  it has  the conventional elastic properties of a solid.  

What is described in this section applies to thermoplastic materials, which can  move up and down the curve of Figure 8.10 multiple times. The manner in which they  are heated and cooled may change the path that is followed. For example, fast cool- ing rates may inhibit crystal formation and increase the glass-transition temperature.  Thermosets and elastomers cooled from the liquid state behave like an amorphous  polymer until cross-linking occurs. Their molecular structure restricts the formation  of crystals. And once their molecules are cross-linked, they cannot be reheated to the  molten state.  

# 8.1.5  ADDITIVES  

The properties of a polymer can often be beneﬁ  cially changed by combining them  with additives. Additives either alter the molecular structure of the polymer or add  a second phase to the plastic, in effect transforming a polymer into a composite mate- rial.  Additives can be classiﬁ  ed by function as (1) ﬁ  llers, (2) plasticizers, (3) colorants,  (4) lubricants, (5) ﬂ  ame retardants, (6) cross-linking agents, (7) ultraviolet light  absorbers, and (8) antioxidants.  

Filler   Fillers  are solid materials added to a polymer usually in particulate or ﬁ  brous  form to alter its mechanical properties or to simply reduce material cost. Other rea- sons for using ﬁ  llers are to improve dimensional and thermal stability. Examples  of ﬁ  llers used in polymers include cellulosic ﬁ  bers and powders (e.g., cotton ﬁ  bers  and wood ﬂ  our, respectively); powders of silica  $(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ , calcium carbonate  $(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3})$ ,  and clay (hydrous aluminum silicate); and ﬁ  bers of glass, metal, carbon, or other  polymers. Fillers that improve mechanical properties are called  reinforcing agents ,  and composites thus created are referred to as  reinforced plastics ; they have higher  stiffness, strength, hardness, and toughness than the original polymer. Fibers provide  the greatest strengthening effect.  

Plasticizers   Plasticizers  are chemicals added to a polymer to make it softer and  more ﬂ  exible, and to improve its ﬂ  ow characteristics during forming. The plasticizer  works by reducing the glass transition temperature to below room temperature.  Whereas the polymer is hard and brittle below Tg, it is soft and tough above it. Addi- tion of a plasticizer 1  to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a good example; depending on the  proportion of plasticizer in the mix, PVC can be obtained in a range of properties,  from rigid and brittle to ﬂ  exible and rubbery. a Low-density polyethylene is used as the polymer example here; most other polymers have slightly higher viscosities. b Glass composition is mostly $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ ; compositions and viscosities vary; values given are representative.  

One can observe in several of the materials listed that viscosity varies with  temperature.  

Viscosity in Manufacturing Processes  For many metals, the viscosity in the  molten state compares with that of water at room temperature. Certain manufactur- ing processes, notably casting and welding, are performed on metals in their molten  state, and success in these operations requires low viscosity so that the molten metal  ﬁ  lls the mold cavity or weld seam before solidifying. In other operations, such as  metal forming and machining, lubricants and coolants are used in the process, and  again the success of these ﬂ  uids depends to some extent on their viscosities.  

Glass ceramics exhibit a gradual transition from solid to liquid states as tempera- ture is increased; they do not suddenly melt as pure metals do. The effect is illustrat- ed by the viscosity values for glass at different temperatures in Table 3.9. At room  temperature, glass is solid and brittle, exhibiting no tendency to ﬂ  ow; for all practical  purposes, its viscosity is inﬁ  nite. As glass is heated, it gradually softens, becoming less  and less viscous (more and more ﬂ  uid), until it can ﬁ  nally be formed by blowing or  molding at around $1100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(2000^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ .  

Most polymer-shaping processes are performed at elevated temperatures, at  which the material is in a liquid or highly plastic condition. Thermoplastic polymers  represent the most straightforward case, and they are also the most common poly- mers. At low temperatures, thermoplastic polymers are solid; as temperature is in- creased, they typically transform ﬁ  rst into a soft rubbery material, and then into  a thick ﬂ  uid. As temperature continues to rise, viscosity decreases gradually, as in  Table 3.9 for polyethylene, the most widely used thermoplastic polymer. However,  with polymers the relationship is complicated by other factors. For example, viscos- ity is affected by ﬂ  ow rate. The viscosity of a thermoplastic polymer is not a constant.  A polymer melt does not behave in a Newtonian fashion. Its relationship between  shear stress and shear rate can be seen in Figure 3.18. A ﬂ  uid that exhibits this de- creasing viscosity with increasing shear rate is called  pseudoplastic . This behavior  complicates the analysis of polymer shaping.

FIGURE 3.18  Viscous  behaviors of Newtonian  and pseudoplastic ﬂ  uids.  Polymer melts exhibit  pseudoplastic behavior.  For comparison, the  behavior of a plastic  solid material is shown.  

#  Viscoelastic Behavior of Polymers  

Another property that is characteristic of polymers is viscoelasticity.  Viscoelasticity is the property of a material that determines the strain it experiences when subjected  to combinations of stress and temperature over time. As the name suggests, it is a  combination of viscosity and elasticity. Viscoelasticity can be explained with refer- ence to Figure 3.19. The two parts of the ﬁ  gure show the typical response of two  materials to an applied stress below the yield point during some time period. The  material in (a) exhibits perfect elasticity; when the stress is removed, the material  returns to its original shape. By contrast, the material in (b) shows viscoelastic be- havior. The amount of strain gradually increases over time under the applied stress.  When stress is removed, the material does not immediately return to its original  shape; instead, the strain decays gradually. If the stress had been applied and then  immediately removed, the material would have returned immediately to its start- ing shape. However, time has entered the picture and played a role in affecting the  behavior of the material.  

A simple model of viscoelasticity can be developed using the deﬁ  nition of elas- ticity as a starting point.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec8.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec8.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt","0.8497340211497433, 0.8464023608930918, 0.8412400820848684"

Polyethylene  Polyethylene (PE) was ﬁ  rst synthesized in the 1930s, and today it  accounts for the largest volume of all plastics. The features that make PE attractive  as an engineering material are low cost, chemical inertness, and easy processing. Poly- ethylene is available in several grades, the most common of which are  low-density  polyethylene  (LDPE) and  high-density polyethylene  (HDPE). The low-density grade  is a highly branched polymer with lower crystallinity and density. Applications include  squeezable bottles, frozen food bags, sheets, ﬁ  lm, and wire insulation. HDPE has a  more linear structure, with higher crystallinity and density. These differences make  HDPE stiffer and stronger and give it a higher melting temperature. HDPE is used to  produce bottles, pipes, and housewares. Both grades can be processed by most polymer  shaping methods (Chapter 13). Properties for the two grades are given in Table 8.3(i).

Elongation depends on additives.  

Polypropylene  Polypropylene (PP) has become a major plastic, especially for injec- tion molding, since its introduction in the late 1950s. PP can be synthesized in isotactic,  syndiotactic, or atactic structures, the ﬁ  rst of these being the most important and for  which the characteristics are given in the table. It is the lightest of the plastics, and its  strength-to-weight ratio is high. PP is frequently compared with HDPE because its  cost and many of its properties are similar. However, the high melting point of poly- propylene allows certain applications that preclude use of polyethylene—for exam- ple, components that must be sterilized. Other applications are injection molded parts  for automotive and houseware, and ﬁ  ber products for carpeting. A special application  suited to polypropylene is one-piece hinges that can be subjected to a high number of  ﬂ  exing cycles without failure.  

Polystyrene  There are several polymers, copolymers, and terpolymers based  on the monomer styrene  $\mathrm{(C_{8}H_{8})}$ , of which polystyrene (PS) is used in the highest  volume. It is a linear homopolymer with amorphous structure that is generally  noted for its brittleness. PS is transparent, easily colored, and readily molded, but  degrades at elevated temperatures and dissolves in various solvents. Because of its  brittleness, some PS grades contain $5\%$  to $15\%$  rubber and the term  high-impact  polystyrene  (HIPS) is used for these types. They have higher toughness, but trans- parency and tensile strength are reduced. In addition to injection molding applica- tions (e.g., molded toys, housewares), polystyrene also ﬁ  nds uses in packaging in  the form of PS foams.  

Polyvinylchloride  Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a widely used plastic whose proper- ties can be varied by combining additives with the polymer. In particular, plasticizers  are used to achieve thermoplastics ranging from rigid PVC (no plasticizers) to ﬂ  exible  PVC (high proportions of plasticizer). The range of properties makes PVC a versatile  polymer, with applications that include rigid pipe (used in construction, water and

PVC by itself is relatively unstable to heat and light, and stabi- lizers must be added to improve its resistance to these environmental conditions. Care  must be taken in the production and handling of the vinyl chloride monomer used to  polymerize PVC, due to its carcinogenic nature.  

#  Thermosetting Polymers  

Thermosetting (TS) polymers are distinguished by their highly cross-linked structure.  In effect, the formed part (e.g., the pot handle or electrical switch cover) becomes one  large macromolecule. Thermosets are always amorphous and exhibit no glass transi- tion temperature. This section examines the general characteristics of the TS plastics  and identify the important materials in this category.  

# 8.3.1 GENERAL PROPERTIES AND CHARACTERISTICS  

Owing to differences in chemistry and molecular structure, properties of thermoset- ting plastics are different from those of thermoplastics. In general, thermosets are  (1) more rigid—modulus of elasticity is two to three times greater; (2) brittle—they  possess virtually no ductility; (3) less soluble in common solvents; (4) capable of  higher service temperatures; and (5) not capable of being remelted—instead they  degrade or burn.  

The differences in properties of the TS plastics are attributable to cross-linking,  which forms a thermally stable, three-dimensional, covalently bonded structure  within the molecule. Cross-linking is accomplished in three ways [7]:  

1.  Temperature-activated systems —In the most common systems, the changes are  caused by heat supplied during the part shaping operation (e.g., molding). The  starting material is a linear polymer in granular form supplied by the chemi- cal plant. As heat is added, the material softens for molding; continued heating  results in cross-linking of the polymer. The term  thermosetting  is most aptly  applied to these polymers.

 2.  Catalyst-activated systems —Cross-linking in these systems occurs when small  amounts of a catalyst are added to the polymer, which is in liquid form. With- out the catalyst, the polymer remains stable; once combined with the catalyst, it  changes into solid form.  

3.  Mixing-activated systems —Most epoxies are examples of these systems. The  mixing of two chemicals results in a reaction that forms a cross-linked solid  polymer. Elevated temperatures are sometimes used to accelerate the reactions.  

The chemical reactions associated with cross-linking are called  curing  or  setting .  Curing is done at the fabrication plants that shape the parts rather than the chemical  plants that supply the starting materials to the fabricator.  

# 8.3.2  IMPORTANT THERMOSETTING POLYMERS  

Thermosetting plastics are not as widely used as the thermoplastics, perhaps because  of the added processing complications involved in curing the TS polymers. The most important  members of the PA family are  nylons , of which the two principal grades are nylon–6  and nylon 6,6 (the numbers are codes that indicate the number of carbon atoms in the  monomer). The data given in Table 8.3(f) are for nylon–6,6, which was developed at  DuPont in the 1930s. Properties of nylon-6, developed in Germany are similar. Nylon  is strong, highly elastic, tough, abrasion resistant, and self-lubricating. It retains good  mechanical properties at temperatures up to about  $125^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(250^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ . One shortcoming  is that it absorbs water with an accompanying degradation in properties. The majority  of applications of nylon (about $90\%$ ) are in ﬁ  bers for carpets, apparel, and tire cord.  The remainder  $(10\%)$  are in engineering components; nylon is commonly a good  substitute for metals in bearings, gears, and similar parts where strength and low fric- tion are needed.  

A second group of polyamides is the  aramids  (aromatic polyamides) of which  Kevlar  (DuPont trade name) is gaining in importance as a ﬁ  ber in reinforced plastics.  The reason for the interest in Kevlar is that its strength is the same as steel at  $20\%$ of the weight.  

Polycarbonate  Polycarbonate (PC) is noted for its generally excellent mechani- cal properties, which include high toughness and good creep resistance. It is one of  the best thermoplastics for heat resistance—it can be used to temperatures around  $125^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(250^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ . In addition, it is transparent and ﬁ  re resistant. Applications include  molded machinery parts, housings for business machines, pump impellers, safety  helmets, and compact disks (e.g., audio, video, and computer). It is also widely used  in glazing (window and windshield) applications.

Polyesters  The polyesters form a family of polymers made up of the characteristic  ester linkages (CO–O). They can be either thermoplastic or thermosetting, depending  on whether cross-linking occurs. Of the thermoplastic polyesters, a representa- tive example is  polyethylene terephthalate  (PET), data for which are compiled in  the table. It can be either amorphous or partially crystallized (up to about  $30\%$ ),  depend  ing on how it is cooled after shaping. Fast cooling favors the amorphous state,  which is highly transparent. Signiﬁ  cant applications include blow-molded beverage  containers, photographic ﬁ  lms, and magnetic recording tape. In addition, PET ﬁ  b- ers are widely used in apparel. Polyester ﬁ  bers have low moisture absorption and  good deformation recovery, both of which make them ideal for “wash and wear”  garments that resist wrinkling. The PET ﬁ  bers are almost always blended with cot- ton or wool. Familiar trade names for polyester ﬁ  bers include Dacron (DuPont) and  Fortrel (Celanese).  

Polyethylene  Polyethylene (PE) was ﬁ  rst synthesized in the 1930s, and today it  accounts for the largest volume of all plastics. The features that make PE attractive  as an engineering material are low cost, chemical inertness, and easy processing. Poly- ethylene is available in several grades, the most common of which are  low-density  polyethylene  (LDPE) and  high-density polyethylene  (HDPE). The low-density grade  is a highly branched polymer with lower crystallinity and density.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec8.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec8.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec8.txt","0.825114898543447, 0.8177184464127252, 0.8143432915488529"

The most important thermoplastic in the acrylics group  is  poly methyl meth a cry late  (PMMA) or Plexiglas (Rohm & Haas’s trade name for  PMMA). Data on PMMA are listed in Table 8.3(b). It is an amorphous linear poly- mer. Its outstanding property is excellent transparency, which makes it competitive  with glass in optical applications. Examples include automotive tail-light lenses,  optical instruments, and aircraft windows. Its limitation when compared with glass  is a much lower scratch resistance. Other uses of PMMA include ﬂ  oor waxes and  emulsion latex paints. Another important use of acrylics is in ﬁ  bers for textiles;  poly acrylonitrile (PAN) is an example that goes by the more familiar trade names  Orlon (DuPont) and Acrilan (Monsanto).  

Acrylonitrile–Butadiene–Styrene  ABS is called an engineering plastic due to  its excellent combination of mechanical properties, some of which are listed in  Table 8.3(c). ABS is a two-phase terpolymer, one phase being the hard copolymer  styrene–acrylonitrile, while the other phase is styrene-butadiene copolymer that  is rubbery. The name of the plastic is derived from the three starting monomers,  which may be mixed in various proportions. Typical applications include compo- nents for automotive, appliances, and business machines; and pipes and ﬁ  ttings.

Cellulosics   Cellulose   $\left(\mathrm{C_{6}H_{10}O}_{5}\right)$  is a carbohydrate polymer commonly occurring  in nature. Wood and cotton ﬁ  bers, the chief industrial sources of cellulose, contain  about  $50\%$  and  $95\%$  of the polymer, respectively. When cellulose is dissolved and  reprecipitated during chemical processing, the resulting polymer is called  regener- ated cellulose . When this is produced as a ﬁ  ber for apparel it is known as  rayon  (of  course, cotton itself is a widely used ﬁ  ber for apparel). When it is produced as a thin  ﬁ  lm, it is  cellophane , a common packaging material. Cellulose itself cannot be used  as a thermo  plastic because it decomposes before melting when its temperature is  increased. However, it can be combined with various compounds to form several  plastics of commercial importance; examples are  cellulose acetate  (CA) and  cellulose  acetate-butyrate  (CAB). CA, data for which are given in Table 8.3(d), is produced in  the form of sheets (for wrapping), ﬁ  lm (for photography), and molded parts. CAB is  a better molding material than CA and has greater impact strength, lower moisture  absorption, and better compatibility with plasticizers. The cellulosic thermoplastics  share about $1\%$  of the market.  

Fluoropolymers   Polytetraﬂ  uorethylene  (PTFE), commonly known as  Teﬂ  on ,  accounts for about  $85\,\%$  of the family of polymers called  ﬂ  uoropolymers , in which  F atoms replace H atoms in the hydrocarbon chain. PTFE is extremely resistant to  chemical and environmental attack, is unaffected by water, good heat resistance,

material into an infusible solid. If reheated, thermosetting polymers degrade and  char rather than soften.  

3.  Elastomers  are the rubbers. Elastomers (E) are polymers that exhibit extreme  elastic extensibility when subjected to relatively low mechanical stress. Some  elastomers can be stretched by a factor of 10 and yet completely recover to their  original shape. Although their properties are quite different from thermosets,  they have a similar molecular structure that is different from the thermoplastics.  

Thermoplastics are commercially the most important of the three types, constitut- ing around $70\%$  of the tonnage of all synthetic polymers produced. Thermosets and  elastomers share the remaining $30\%$  about evenly, with a slight edge for the former.  Common TP polymers include polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene,  poly  styrene, and nylon. Examples of TS polymers are phenolics, epoxies, and certain  polyesters. The most common example given for elastomers is natural (vulcanized)  rubber; however, synthetic rubbers exceed the tonnage of natural rubber.  

Although the classiﬁ  cation of polymers into the TP , TS, and E categories suits the  purpose of organizing the topic in this chapter, note that the three types sometimes  overlap. Certain polymers that are normally thermoplastic can be made into ther- mosets. Some polymers can be either thermosets or elastomers (recall that their  molecular structures are similar). And some elastomers are thermoplastic. However,  these are exceptions to the general classiﬁ  cation scheme.  

The growth in applications of synthetic polymers is truly impressive. On a volu- metric basis, current annual usage of polymers exceeds that of metals. There are  several reasons for the commercial and technological importance of polymers:  

$\succcurlyeq$ Plastics can be formed by molding into intricate part geometries, usually  with no further processing required. They are very compatible with  net shape processing.

 $\succcurlyeq$ Plastics possess an attractive list of properties for many engineering applications  where strength is not a factor: (1) low density relative to metals and ceramics; (2)  good strength-to-weight ratios for certain (but not all) polymers; (3) high corrosion  resistance; and (4) low electrical and thermal conductivity.

 $\succcurlyeq$ On a volumetric basis, polymers are cost competitive with metals.

 $\succcurlyeq$ On a volumetric basis, polymers generally require less energy to produce than  metals. This is generally true because the temperatures for working these materials  are much lower than for metals.

 $\succcurlyeq$ Certain plastics are translucent and/or transparent, which makes them competi- tive with glass in some applications.

 $\succcurlyeq$ Polymers are widely used in composite materials (Chapter 9).  

On the negative side, polymers in general have the following limitations: (1) strength  is low relative to metals and ceramics; (2) modulus of elasticity or stiffness is also low— in the case of elastomers, of course, this may be a desirable characteristic; (3) service  temperatures are limited to only a few hundred degrees because of the softening of  thermoplastic polymers or degradation of thermosetting polymers and elastomers;  (4) some polymers degrade when subjected to sunlight and other forms of radiation;  and (5) plastics exhibit viscoelastic properties (Section 3.5), which can be a distinct  limitation in load bearing applications.  

This chapter examines the technology of polymeric materials. The ﬁ  rst section is  devoted to an introductory discussion of polymer science and technology. Subsequent  sections survey the three basic categories of polymers: thermoplastics, thermosets,  and elastomers.  

# Fundamentals of Polymer Science  and Technology  

Polymers are synthesized by joining many small molecules together to form very  large molecules, called  macromolecules , that possess a chain-like structure. The  small units, called  monomers , are generally simple unsaturated organic molecules  such as ethylene  $\mathrm{C_{2}H_{4}}$ . The most important  members of the PA family are  nylons , of which the two principal grades are nylon–6  and nylon 6,6 (the numbers are codes that indicate the number of carbon atoms in the  monomer). The data given in Table 8.3(f) are for nylon–6,6, which was developed at  DuPont in the 1930s. Properties of nylon-6, developed in Germany are similar. Nylon  is strong, highly elastic, tough, abrasion resistant, and self-lubricating. It retains good  mechanical properties at temperatures up to about  $125^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(250^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ . One shortcoming  is that it absorbs water with an accompanying degradation in properties. The majority  of applications of nylon (about $90\%$ ) are in ﬁ  bers for carpets, apparel, and tire cord.  The remainder  $(10\%)$  are in engineering components; nylon is commonly a good  substitute for metals in bearings, gears, and similar parts where strength and low fric- tion are needed.  

A second group of polyamides is the  aramids  (aromatic polyamides) of which  Kevlar  (DuPont trade name) is gaining in importance as a ﬁ  ber in reinforced plastics.  The reason for the interest in Kevlar is that its strength is the same as steel at  $20\%$ of the weight.  

Polycarbonate  Polycarbonate (PC) is noted for its generally excellent mechani- cal properties, which include high toughness and good creep resistance. It is one of  the best thermoplastics for heat resistance—it can be used to temperatures around  $125^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(250^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ . In addition, it is transparent and ﬁ  re resistant. Applications include  molded machinery parts, housings for business machines, pump impellers, safety  helmets, and compact disks (e.g., audio, video, and computer). It is also widely used  in glazing (window and windshield) applications.

Linear polymers consist of long molecules with thousands of repeated mers. Crys- tallization in these polymers involves the folding back and forth of the long chains

upon themselves to achieve a very regular arrangement of the mers, as pictured in  Figure 8.9(a). The crystallized regions are called  crystallites . Owing to the tremen- dous length of a single molecule (on an atomic scale), it may participate in more than  one crystallite. Also, more than one molecule may be combined in a single crystal  region. The crystallites take the form of lamellae, as pictured in Figure 8.9(b), that are  randomly mixed in with the amorphous material. Thus, a polymer that crystallizes  is a two-phase system—crystallites interspersed throughout an amorphous matrix.  

A number of factors determine the capacity and/or tendency of a polymer to form  crystalline regions within the material. The factors can be summarized as follows:  (1) as a general rule, only linear polymers can form crystals; (2) stereo regularity of  the molecule is critical [15]: isotactic polymers always form crystals; syndiotactic poly- mers sometimes form crystals; atactic polymers never form crystals; (3) copolymers,  due to their molecular irregularity, rarely form crystals; (4) slower cooling promotes  crystal formation and growth, as it does in metals and ceramics; (5) mechanical defor- mation, as in the stretching of a heated thermoplastic, tends to align the structure and  increase crystallization; and (6) plasticizers (chemicals added to a polymer to soften  it) reduce the degree of crystallinity.  

# 8.1.4  THERMAL BEHAVIOR OF POLYMERS  

The thermal behavior of polymers with crystalline structures is different from that  of amorphous polymers (Section 2.4). The effect of structure can be observed on a  plot of speciﬁ  c volume (reciprocal of density) as a function of temperature, as plot- ted in Figure 8.10. A highly crystalline polymer has a melting point  $T_{m}$  at which its  volume undergoes an abrupt change. Also, at temperatures above  $T_{m}$ , the thermal  expansion of the molten material is greater than for the solid material below  $T_{m}$ . An  amorphous polymer does not undergo the same abrupt changes at  $T_{m}$ . As it is cooled  from the liquid, its coefﬁ  cient of thermal expansion continues to decline along the

same trajectory as when it was molten, and it becomes increasingly viscous with  decreasing temperature. During cooling below  $T_{m}$ , the polymer changes from liquid  to rubbery. As temperature continues to drop, a point is ﬁ  nally reached at which the  thermal expansion of the amorphous polymer suddenly becomes lower. two phases. The partially crystallized polymer exhibits features of both amorphous  and fully crystallized plastics. Below $T_{g}$ , it is elastic with deformation resistance sloping  downward with rising temperatures. Above  $T_{g},$ , the amorphous portions of the polymer  soften, while the crystalline portions remain intact. The bulk material exhibits pro- perties that are generally viscoelastic. As  $T_{m}$  is reached, the crystals now melt, giving  the polymer a liquid consistency; resistance to deformation is now due to the ﬂ  uid’s  viscous properties. The degree to which the polymer assumes liquid characteristics at  and above  $T_{m}$  depends on molecular weight and degree of polymerization. Higher DP  and MW reduces ﬂ  ow of the polymer, making it more difﬁ  cult to process by molding  and similar shaping methods.  This is a dilemma faced by those who select these materials  because higher MW and DP mean higher strength.  

Physical Properties  Physical properties of materials are discussed in Chapter 4. In  general, thermoplastic polymers have the following characteristics: (1) lower densi- ties than metals or ceramics—typical speciﬁ  c gravities for polymers are around 1.2,  for ceramics around 2.5, and for metals around 7.0; (2) much higher coefﬁ  cient of  thermal expansion—roughly ﬁ  ve times the value for metals and 10 times the value  for ceramics; (3) much lower melting temperatures; (4) speciﬁ  c heats that are two to  four times those of metals and ceramics; (5) thermal conductivities that are about  three orders of magnitude lower than those of metals; and (6) insulating electrical  properties.  

# 8.2.2  IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL THERMOPLASTICS  

Thermoplastic products include molded and extruded items, ﬁ  bers, ﬁ  lms, sheets, pack- aging materials, paints, and varnishes. The starting raw materials for these products are  normally supplied to the fabricator in the form of powders or pellets in bags, drums,  or larger loads by truck or rail car. The most important TP polymers are discussed in  alphabetical order in this section. For each plastic, Table 8.3 lists the chemical formula  and selected properties. Approximate market share is given relative to all plastics  (thermoplastic and thermosetting).

a Table 8.3 is compiled from [2], [4], [6], [7], [9], [16], and other sources.  

Acetals   Acetal  is the popular name given to  poly oxy methylene , an engineering  polymer prepared from formaldehyde  $\mathrm{(CH_{2}O)}$  with high stiffness, strength, toughness,  and wear resistance. In addition, it has a high melting point, low moisture absorption,  and is insoluble in common solvents at ambient temperatures. Because of this combi- nation of properties, acetal resins are competitive with certain metals (e.g., brass and  zinc) in automotive components such as door handles, pump housings, and similar  parts; appliance hardware; and machinery components.  

Acrylics  The acrylics are polymers derived from acrylic acid  $(\mathrm{C}_{3}\mathrm{H}_{4}\mathrm{O}_{2})$  and com- pounds originating from it. The most important thermoplastic in the acrylics group  is  poly methyl meth a cry late  (PMMA) or Plexiglas (Rohm & Haas’s trade name for  PMMA). Data on PMMA are listed in Table 8.3(b). It is an amorphous linear poly- mer. Its outstanding property is excellent transparency, which makes it competitive  with glass in optical applications. Examples include automotive tail-light lenses,  optical instruments, and aircraft windows. Its limitation when compared with glass  is a much lower scratch resistance. Other uses of PMMA include ﬂ  oor waxes and  emulsion latex paints. They have higher toughness, but trans- parency and tensile strength are reduced. In addition to injection molding applica- tions (e.g., molded toys, housewares), polystyrene also ﬁ  nds uses in packaging in  the form of PS foams.  

Polyvinylchloride  Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a widely used plastic whose proper- ties can be varied by combining additives with the polymer. In particular, plasticizers  are used to achieve thermoplastics ranging from rigid PVC (no plasticizers) to ﬂ  exible  PVC (high proportions of plasticizer). The range of properties makes PVC a versatile  polymer, with applications that include rigid pipe (used in construction, water and

sewer systems, irrigation), ﬁ  ttings, wire and cable insulation, ﬁ  lm, sheets, food packag- ing, ﬂ  ooring, and toys. PVC by itself is relatively unstable to heat and light, and stabi- lizers must be added to improve its resistance to these environmental conditions. Care  must be taken in the production and handling of the vinyl chloride monomer used to  polymerize PVC, due to its carcinogenic nature.  

#  Thermosetting Polymers  

Thermosetting (TS) polymers are distinguished by their highly cross-linked structure.  In effect, the formed part (e.g., the pot handle or electrical switch cover) becomes one  large macromolecule. Thermosets are always amorphous and exhibit no glass transi- tion temperature. This section examines the general characteristics of the TS plastics  and identify the important materials in this category.  

# 8.3.1 GENERAL PROPERTIES AND CHARACTERISTICS  

Owing to differences in chemistry and molecular structure, properties of thermoset- ting plastics are different from those of thermoplastics. In general, thermosets are  (1) more rigid—modulus of elasticity is two to three times greater; (2) brittle—they  possess virtually no ductility; (3) less soluble in common solvents; (4) capable of  higher service temperatures; and (5) not capable of being remelted—instead they  degrade or burn.  

The differences in properties of the TS plastics are attributable to cross-linking,  which forms a thermally stable, three-dimensional, covalently bonded structure  within the molecule. Cross-linking is accomplished in three ways [7]:  

1.  Temperature-activated systems —In the most common systems, the changes are  caused by heat supplied during the part shaping operation (e.g., molding). The  starting material is a linear polymer in granular form supplied by the chemi- cal plant. As heat is added, the material softens for molding; continued heating  results in cross-linking of the polymer. The term  thermosetting  is most aptly  applied to these polymers.

 2.  Catalyst-activated systems —Cross-linking in these systems occurs when small  amounts of a catalyst are added to the polymer, which is in liquid form. With- out the catalyst, the polymer remains stable; once combined with the catalyst, it  changes into solid form.  

3.  Mixing-activated systems —Most epoxies are examples of these systems. The  mixing of two chemicals results in a reaction that forms a cross-linked solid  polymer. Elevated temperatures are sometimes used to accelerate the reactions.  

The chemical reactions associated with cross-linking are called  curing  or  setting .  Curing is done at the fabrication plants that shape the parts rather than the chemical  plants that supply the starting materials to the fabricator.  

# 8.3.2  IMPORTANT THERMOSETTING POLYMERS  

Thermosetting plastics are not as widely used as the thermoplastics, perhaps because  of the added processing complications involved in curing the TS polymers.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec8.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec8.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec8.txt","0.8359237018366671, 0.8286457266773569, 0.8247862423404312"

The data given in Table 8.3(f) are for nylon–6,6, which was developed at  DuPont in the 1930s. Properties of nylon-6, developed in Germany are similar. Nylon  is strong, highly elastic, tough, abrasion resistant, and self-lubricating. It retains good  mechanical properties at temperatures up to about  $125^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(250^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ . One shortcoming  is that it absorbs water with an accompanying degradation in properties. The majority  of applications of nylon (about $90\%$ ) are in ﬁ  bers for carpets, apparel, and tire cord.  The remainder  $(10\%)$  are in engineering components; nylon is commonly a good  substitute for metals in bearings, gears, and similar parts where strength and low fric- tion are needed.  

A second group of polyamides is the  aramids  (aromatic polyamides) of which  Kevlar  (DuPont trade name) is gaining in importance as a ﬁ  ber in reinforced plastics.  The reason for the interest in Kevlar is that its strength is the same as steel at  $20\%$ of the weight.  

Polycarbonate  Polycarbonate (PC) is noted for its generally excellent mechani- cal properties, which include high toughness and good creep resistance. It is one of  the best thermoplastics for heat resistance—it can be used to temperatures around  $125^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(250^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ . In addition, it is transparent and ﬁ  re resistant. Applications include  molded machinery parts, housings for business machines, pump impellers, safety  helmets, and compact disks (e.g., audio, video, and computer). It is also widely used  in glazing (window and windshield) applications.

Polyesters  The polyesters form a family of polymers made up of the characteristic  ester linkages (CO–O). They can be either thermoplastic or thermosetting, depending  on whether cross-linking occurs. Of the thermoplastic polyesters, a representa- tive example is  polyethylene terephthalate  (PET), data for which are compiled in  the table. It can be either amorphous or partially crystallized (up to about  $30\%$ ),  depend  ing on how it is cooled after shaping. Fast cooling favors the amorphous state,  which is highly transparent. Signiﬁ  cant applications include blow-molded beverage  containers, photographic ﬁ  lms, and magnetic recording tape. In addition, PET ﬁ  b- ers are widely used in apparel. Polyester ﬁ  bers have low moisture absorption and  good deformation recovery, both of which make them ideal for “wash and wear”  garments that resist wrinkling. The PET ﬁ  bers are almost always blended with cot- ton or wool. Familiar trade names for polyester ﬁ  bers include Dacron (DuPont) and  Fortrel (Celanese).  

Polyethylene  Polyethylene (PE) was ﬁ  rst synthesized in the 1930s, and today it  accounts for the largest volume of all plastics. The features that make PE attractive  as an engineering material are low cost, chemical inertness, and easy processing. Poly- ethylene is available in several grades, the most common of which are  low-density  polyethylene  (LDPE) and  high-density polyethylene  (HDPE). The low-density grade  is a highly branched polymer with lower crystallinity and density.

HDPE has a  more linear structure, with higher crystallinity and density. These differences make  HDPE stiffer and stronger and give it a higher melting temperature. HDPE is used to  produce bottles, pipes, and housewares. Both grades can be processed by most polymer  shaping methods (Chapter 13). Properties for the two grades are given in Table 8.3(i).

Elongation depends on additives.  

Polypropylene  Polypropylene (PP) has become a major plastic, especially for injec- tion molding, since its introduction in the late 1950s. PP can be synthesized in isotactic,  syndiotactic, or atactic structures, the ﬁ  rst of these being the most important and for  which the characteristics are given in the table. It is the lightest of the plastics, and its  strength-to-weight ratio is high. PP is frequently compared with HDPE because its  cost and many of its properties are similar. However, the high melting point of poly- propylene allows certain applications that preclude use of polyethylene—for exam- ple, components that must be sterilized. Other applications are injection molded parts  for automotive and houseware, and ﬁ  ber products for carpeting. A special application  suited to polypropylene is one-piece hinges that can be subjected to a high number of  ﬂ  exing cycles without failure.  

Polystyrene  There are several polymers, copolymers, and terpolymers based  on the monomer styrene  $\mathrm{(C_{8}H_{8})}$ , of which polystyrene (PS) is used in the highest  volume. It is a linear homopolymer with amorphous structure that is generally  noted for its brittleness. PS is transparent, easily colored, and readily molded, but  degrades at elevated temperatures and dissolves in various solvents. Because of its  brittleness, some PS grades contain $5\%$  to $15\%$  rubber and the term  high-impact  polystyrene  (HIPS) is used for these types. They have higher toughness, but trans- parency and tensile strength are reduced. In addition to injection molding applica- tions (e.g., molded toys, housewares), polystyrene also ﬁ  nds uses in packaging in  the form of PS foams.  

Polyvinylchloride  Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a widely used plastic whose proper- ties can be varied by combining additives with the polymer. In particular, plasticizers  are used to achieve thermoplastics ranging from rigid PVC (no plasticizers) to ﬂ  exible  PVC (high proportions of plasticizer). The range of properties makes PVC a versatile  polymer, with applications that include rigid pipe (used in construction, water and

! CAB is  a better molding material than CA and has greater impact strength, lower moisture  absorption, and better compatibility with plasticizers. The cellulosic thermoplastics  share about $1\%$  of the market.  

Fluoropolymers   Polytetraﬂ  uorethylene  (PTFE), commonly known as  Teﬂ  on ,  accounts for about  $85\,\%$  of the family of polymers called  ﬂ  uoropolymers , in which  F atoms replace H atoms in the hydrocarbon chain. PTFE is extremely resistant to  chemical and environmental attack, is unaffected by water, good heat resistance,

and very low coefﬁ  cient of friction. These latter two properties have promoted  its use in nonstick household cookware. Other applications that rely on the same  property include nonlubricating bearings and similar components. PTFE also ﬁ  nds  applications in chemical equipment and food processing.  

Polyamides  An important polymer family that forms characteristic amide link- ages (CO-NH) during polymerization is the polyamides (PA). The most important  members of the PA family are  nylons , of which the two principal grades are nylon–6  and nylon 6,6 (the numbers are codes that indicate the number of carbon atoms in the  monomer).

(a), (d), and (f).","Die casting is a manufacturing process that is typically used for metals with relatively low melting points and good fluidity to fill the mold. The metals most commonly used in die casting are:

(a) Aluminum - Aluminum is a popular choice for die casting due to its low density, good corrosion resistance, and excellent castability.

(d) Tin - Tin can be die cast, though it is less common compared to other choices. Tin alloys, however, are used in certain specialized die casting applications.

(f) Zinc - Zinc is another metal that is widely used for die casting. It has excellent fluidity, relatively low melting point, and good mechanical properties, making it ideal for creating complex shapes with fine details.

Cast iron, steel, and tungsten are not typically die casted due to their high melting points and poor fluidity:
(b) Cast iron - It is primarily used in sand casting and other casting methods, not die casting.
(c) Steel - It is usually formed through methods like forging or traditional casting, rather than die casting.
(e) Tungsten - Its very high melting point makes it unsuitable for traditional die casting processes."

(a), (c), and (e).","The advantages of die casting over sand casting from the options provided are:

(a) Better surface finish - Die casting typically produces parts with a smoother surface finish compared to sand casting.

(c) Higher production rates - Die casting is generally faster and allows for higher production rates due to the rapid cooling and solidification of the metal within the metal mold.

(e) Mold can be reused - Die casting involves the use of durable metal molds that can be reused multiple times, unlike sand casting, where the mold is usually destroyed during the process.

The options (b) higher melting temperature metals and (d) larger parts can be casted are not typically advantages of die casting compared to sand casting. Die casting is generally not suitable for metals with higher melting temperatures and is more limited in the size of the parts that can be produced compared to sand casting."

A branched molecular structure is stronger in the solid state and more viscous in the molten state than a linear structure for the same polymer: (a) true or (b) false.,Answer. (a),"(a) true. 

A branched molecular structure generally leads to a stronger solid state for the same polymer compared to a linear structure. This is because branching can increase entanglements and reduce the ability of chains to slide past one another, thus enhancing the mechanical strength of the solid polymer. 

In the molten state, the increased entanglements and interactions among the branched chains typically result in higher viscosity compared to linear structures, as the branched chains have a more complex and interconnected structure that resists flow."
A copolymer is a mixture consisting of macromolecules of two different homopolymers: (a) true or (b)	false.,Answer. (b),"(b) false. A copolymer is not a mixture of two different homopolymers. Instead, it is a polymer derived from two (or more) different monomer species bonded together in the same polymer chain. Homopolymers, on the other hand, consist of only one type of monomer."
"As temperature of a polymer increases, its density (a) increases, (b) decreases, or (c) remains fairly constant.",Answer. (b),"As the temperature of a polymer increases, its density typically (b) decreases. This is because polymers generally expand when heated, causing their volume to increase while the mass remains constant, leading to a decrease in density."
"Which answers complete the following sentence correctly (more than one): As the temperature of an amorphous thermoplastic polymer is gradually reduced, the glass transition temperature Tg is indicated when (a) the polymer transforms to a crystalline structure, (b) the coefficient of thermal expansion increases markedly, (c) the slope of specific volume versus temperature changes markedly, (d) the polymer becomes stiff, strong, and elastic, or (e) the polymer solidifies from the molten state.",Answer. (c) and (d).,"The correct answers to complete the sentence are (c) the slope of specific volume versus temperature changes markedly, and (d) the polymer becomes stiff, strong, and elastic.

Explanation:
- (c) The slope of specific volume versus temperature changes markedly: As the temperature decreases through the glass transition temperature \(T_g\), a noticeable change occurs in the thermal expansion behavior, which is manifested as a marked change in the slope of the specific volume versus temperature plot.
- (d) The polymer becomes stiff, strong, and elastic: Below the glass transition temperature, the polymer becomes rigid and exhibits glass-like properties, including increased stiffness, strength, and elasticity compared to its rubbery state above \(T_g\).

The other options are not correct in the context of the glass transition temperature for an amorphous thermoplastic polymer:
- (a) The polymer transforms to a crystalline structure: This does not describe the glass transition but rather a crystallization process, which is distinct and not directly related to \(T_g\).
- (b) The coefficient of thermal expansion increases markedly: The coefficient of thermal expansion typically decreases as the material becomes more rigid below \(T_g\).
- (e) The polymer solidifies from the molten state: This pertains to the solidification process or the melting point for crystalline materials, not the glass transition in amorphous polymers."

"Polystyrene (without plasticizers) is amorphous, transparent, and brittle: (a) true or (b) false.",Answer. (a),"(a) true.

Polystyrene is indeed amorphous, meaning it lacks a crystalline structure, which contributes to its transparency. It is also known to be brittle, especially at room temperature, when it doesn't contain any plasticizers to make it more flexible."

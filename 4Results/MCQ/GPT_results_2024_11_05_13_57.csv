(b),"The correct reason a green mold is so named is (a) green is the color of the mold. Mold is typically named for its color, so green mold is called such because of its green appearance."
"Given that Wm = weight of the molten metal displaced by a core and Wc = weight of the core, the buoyancy force is which one of the following? (a) downward force = Wm + Wc, (b) downward force = Wm - Wc, (c) upward force = Wm + Wc, or (d) upward force = Wm - Wc.",Answer. (d),"The buoyancy force, which is the upward force exerted on an object submerged in a fluid, is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. In the given scenario, the weight of the molten metal displaced by the core is represented by \( Wm \), and the weight of the core is \( Wc \). The buoyancy force is the net force acting in the upward direction, which is the difference between the weight of the displaced fluid and the weight of the core.

Therefore, the correct expression for the buoyancy force is an upward force equal to the weight of the displaced molten metal minus the weight of the core. Thus, the correct answer is:

(d) upward force = \( Wm - Wc \)."

(d) Tin - Tin is used in die casting, often in the form of tin-based alloys. Its low melting point makes it suitable for die casting processes.

(f) Zinc - Zinc is one of the most popular metals for die casting because of its excellent casting properties, strength, and ability to produce intricate details.

Cast iron, steel, and tungsten are not typically die casted due to their high melting points and other factors that make them unsuitable for this process."

(e) Mold can be reused - Die casting uses durable metal molds that can be reused many times, unlike sand molds which are usually destroyed after each use. 

Options (b) and (d) are not advantages of die casting over sand casting. In fact, die casting is typically not suitable for higher melting temperature metals and is limited in the size of parts it can effectively cast compared to sand casting."

(a),"(a) Thermoplastics are generally considered the most important commercially among the three types of polymers. They account for the largest segment of the plastics market due to their versatility, ease of processing, recyclability, and wide range of applications. Thermoplastics are used in everything from packaging materials and consumer goods to automotive components and construction products. Their ability to be melted and reshaped multiple times without significant chemical change or degradation makes them highly valuable in numerous industries."

(c),"Elastomers (c) are not normally considered to be plastics. While thermoplastics and thermosets are types of plastics, elastomers are rubber-like materials known for their elasticity and ability to return to their original shape after being stretched or deformed."
"Which one of the three polymer types does not involve cross- linking? (a) thermoplastics, (b) thermosets, or (c) elastomers.",Answer. (a),"(a) Thermoplastics do not involve cross-linking. Thermoplastics are composed of linear or slightly branched chains that can be remelted and reshaped. In contrast, thermosets and elastomers involve cross-linking, which forms a network structure that cannot be remelted without decomposition."
"As the degree of crystallinity in a given polymer increases, the polymer becomes denser and stiffer, and its melting temperature decreases: (a) true or (b) false.",Answer. (b) Melting temperature increases with higher degree of crystallinity.,"(b) false. As the degree of crystallinity in a polymer increases, the polymer becomes denser and stiffer, and its melting temperature typically increases, not decreases. Crystalline regions have a more ordered structure, which requires more energy (in the form of heat) to disrupt compared to amorphous regions, thus leading to a higher melting temperature."
"Which of the following is the chemical formula for the repeating unit in polyethylene? (a) CH2, (b) C2H4, (c) C3H6, (d) C5H8, or (e) C8H8.",Answer. (b),"The chemical formula for the repeating unit in polyethylene is (a) CH2. Polyethylene is a polymer made from the polymerization of ethylene (C2H4) monomers, and the repeating unit in its structure is -CH2-CH2-. However, the simplest repeating unit can be represented as CH2."
Degree of polymerization is which one of the following? (a) average number of mers in the molecule chain; (b) proportion of the monomer that has been polymerized; (c) sum of the molecule weights of the mers in the molecule; or (d) none of the above.,Answer. (a),The degree of polymerization is (a) the average number of mers in the molecule chain. This term refers to the number of repeating units (mers) in a polymer chain and is a measure of the length of the polymer molecule.
A branched molecular structure is stronger in the solid state and more viscous in the molten state than a linear structure for the same polymer: (a) true or (b) false.,Answer. (a),"(a) true. A branched molecular structure often leads to increased intermolecular interactions in the solid state, making the material stronger compared to a linear structure. In the molten state, the branches can entangle more easily, increasing viscosity compared to a linear polymer."
A copolymer is a mixture consisting of macromolecules of two different homopolymers: (a) true or (b)	false.,Answer. (b),"(b) false.

A copolymer is not a mixture of two different homopolymers; rather, it is a polymer derived from two (or more) different monomer species polymerized together. The arrangement of these monomers in the polymer chain can vary, leading to different types of copolymers such as random, alternating, block, or graft copolymers."
"As temperature of a polymer increases, its density (a) increases, (b) decreases, or (c) remains fairly constant.",Answer. (b),"As the temperature of a polymer increases, its density generally (b) decreases. This is because heating causes the polymer chains to gain kinetic energy, leading to an increase in the volume as the chains move more vigorously and occupy a larger space. Since density is mass per unit volume, an increase in volume with a constant mass results in a decrease in density."
"Which answers complete the following sentence correctly (more than one): As the temperature of an amorphous thermoplastic polymer is gradually reduced, the glass transition temperature Tg is indicated when (a) the polymer transforms to a crystalline structure, (b) the coefficient of thermal expansion increases markedly, (c) the slope of specific volume versus temperature changes markedly, (d) the polymer becomes stiff, strong, and elastic, or (e) the polymer solidifies from the molten state.",Answer. (c) and (d).,"The correct answers are:

(c) the slope of specific volume versus temperature changes markedly: The glass transition temperature \( T_g \) is characterized by a change in the slope in a plot of specific volume versus temperature, indicating a transition in the polymer's thermal expansion behavior.

(d) the polymer becomes stiff, strong, and elastic: At the glass transition temperature, the polymer transitions from a rubbery or viscous state to a glassy state, where it becomes stiff and strong. Elastic behavior is also more pronounced below \( T_g \)."

(b) Cellulose acetate  
(c) Nylon  
(e) Polyethylene  

These materials typically exhibit the characteristics of thermoplastics, which include being able to be repeatedly melted and reshaped upon heating. While some forms of polyurethane can be thermoplastic, it is more commonly found and used in thermosetting forms, so it’s not included in the list. Polychloroprene is usually considered an elastomer, not a thermoplastic."

"As the degree of crystallinity in a given polymer increases, the polymer becomes denser and stiffer, and its melting temperature decreases: (a) true or (b) false.",Answer. (b) Melting temperature increases with higher degree of crystallinity.,"(b) false.

As the degree of crystallinity in a polymer increases, the polymer typically becomes denser and stiffer, and its melting temperature actually increases. Increased crystallinity results in more orderly molecular packing, leading to higher density and rigidity, as well as a higher melting temperature due to the greater energy required to disrupt the crystalline regions."

However, during the polymerization process, the double bond in ethylene breaks, allowing the molecules to link together to form a long chain. The repeating unit thus consists of two carbon atoms and four hydrogen atoms, arranged in a single-bonded chain. Therefore, the chemical formula for the repeating unit in polyethylene is CH2-CH2. Given the options, the closest representation is option (a) CH2."

A branched molecular structure is stronger in the solid state and more viscous in the molten state than a linear structure for the same polymer: (a) true or (b) false.,Answer. (a),"(a) true. 

Branched molecular structures tend to have stronger interactions in the solid state because the branches can create more points of contact between polymer chains, leading to a more entangled and potentially stronger structure compared to linear polymers. In the molten state, the branches can also increase the viscosity because they can hinder the flow of the polymer chains past one another, leading to a more viscous melt."
A copolymer is a mixture consisting of macromolecules of two different homopolymers: (a) true or (b)	false.,Answer. (b),"(b) false. A copolymer is not a mixture of two different homopolymers. Instead, it is a polymer made from two or more different types of monomers chemically bonded together in the same polymer chain."
"As temperature of a polymer increases, its density (a) increases, (b) decreases, or (c) remains fairly constant.",Answer. (b),"(b) decreases. As the temperature of a polymer increases, the thermal motion of the polymer chains typically increases, causing the material to expand and its density to decrease."
"Which answers complete the following sentence correctly (more than one): As the temperature of an amorphous thermoplastic polymer is gradually reduced, the glass transition temperature Tg is indicated when (a) the polymer transforms to a crystalline structure, (b) the coefficient of thermal expansion increases markedly, (c) the slope of specific volume versus temperature changes markedly, (d) the polymer becomes stiff, strong, and elastic, or (e) the polymer solidifies from the molten state.",Answer. (c) and (d).,"The correct answers to complete the sentence regarding the glass transition temperature \( T_g \) of an amorphous thermoplastic polymer are:

(c) the slope of specific volume versus temperature changes markedly: This is one of the key indicators of the glass transition temperature. At \( T_g \), there is a noticeable change in the slope due to the change in the mobility of the polymer chains.

(d) the polymer becomes stiff, strong, and elastic: Below the glass transition temperature, the polymer transitions into a glassy state and becomes more rigid, displaying properties like increased stiffness and strength, which are characteristic of the material being below \( T_g \).

Option (b) is incorrect for decreasing temperature, as the coefficient of thermal expansion typically decreases rather than increases as the material passes through \( T_g \).

Options (a) and (e) are incorrect because \( T_g \) is distinct from the melting point or crystallization temperature where these changes would occur. Crystallization and solidification from a molten state occur at different thermal points and are not indicative of the glass transition."

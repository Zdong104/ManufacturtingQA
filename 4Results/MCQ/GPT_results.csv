"Given that Wm = weight of the molten metal displaced by a core and Wc = weight of the core, the buoyancy force is which one of the following? (a) downward force = Wm + Wc, (b) downward force = Wm - Wc, (c) upward force = Wm + Wc, or (d) upward force = Wm - Wc.",Answer. (d),"The buoyancy force is the upward force exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of an object immersed in the fluid. According to Archimedes' principle, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.

In this context, the buoyancy force is the upward force exerted on the core by the molten metal, and it would be equal to the weight of the molten metal displaced by the core. Therefore, the buoyancy force is an upward force and is equal to the weight of the displaced molten metal, Wm.

A branched molecular structure is stronger in the solid state and more viscous in the molten state than a linear structure for the same polymer: (a) true or (b) false.,Answer. (a),"The statement is (a) true. Branched molecular structures generally create more entanglements compared to linear structures, which can lead to a stronger material in the solid state due to these entanglements and interactions between the branches. Additionally, in the molten state, these branches can lead to higher viscosity because the molecular chains are more likely to become tangled, making it more difficult for them to flow past one another."
A copolymer is a mixture consisting of macromolecules of two different homopolymers: (a) true or (b)	false.,Answer. (b),"(b) false. 

A copolymer is not a mixture of macromolecules of two different homopolymers. Instead, it is a polymer made from two (or more) different monomers chemically bonded together in the same chain. These monomers can be arranged in various sequences such as alternating, random, block, or graft forms."
"As temperature of a polymer increases, its density (a) increases, (b) decreases, or (c) remains fairly constant.",Answer.

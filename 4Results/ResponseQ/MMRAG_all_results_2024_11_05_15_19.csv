We have classified glass as a ceramic material; yet glass is different from the traditional and new ceramics. What is the difference?,"Answer. Glass is vitreous - it is in the glassy state, whereas traditional and new ceramics are, by and large, polycrystalline materials.","Glass is classified as a ceramic material due to its inorganic, non-metallic composition, but it differs significantly from traditional and new ceramics in its structure and properties.

1. **Structure:**
   - **Glass** is an amorphous solid, meaning it lacks the long-range crystalline order found in traditional ceramics. This amorphous structure is due to its rapid cooling from the molten state, which prevents the atoms from organizing into a crystalline lattice.
   - **Traditional and new ceramics**, on the other hand, have a crystalline structure with a regular, repeating arrangement of atoms. This crystalline structure is typically achieved through controlled cooling and processing techniques like sintering.

2. **Properties:**
   - **Glass** typically has high transparency, which is a direct result of its amorphous structure and lack of grain boundaries, making it suitable for applications like optical lenses and fiber optics.
   - **Ceramics** are generally opaque and can exhibit a range of colors and surface textures depending on the crystalline phases present.

3. **Processing:**
   - **Glass** can be shaped in its molten state, which allows for more economical manufacturing techniques compared to the powder-based methods used for many ceramics, such as pressing and sintering.
   - **Ceramics** are often formed into shape from powders followed by high-temperature sintering to achieve the desired density and mechanical properties.

4. **Mechanical Properties:**
   - **Glass** tends to be more brittle than many ceramics due to its amorphous structure.
   - **Ceramics** can have various mechanical properties, such as higher toughness and strength, especially when engineered with specific crystalline structures or composites.

In summary, while both glass and ceramics share fundamental inorganic, non-metallic characteristics, their differences in structure, properties, and processing methodologies underscore the unique applications and behaviors of each material type.","Another glass fiber material is S- glass, which has higher strength but is not as economical as E-glass. Compositions are  indicated in the table.  

Insulating fiberglass wool can be manufactured from regular soda-lime-silica  glasses. The glass product for fiber optics consists of a long, continuous core of glass  with high refractive index surrounded by a sheath of lower refractive glass. The in-  side glass must have a very high transmittance for light in order to accomplish long  distance communication.  

Optical Glasses  Applications for these glasses include lenses for eyeglasses and  optical instruments such as cameras, microscopes, and telescopes. To achieve their  function, the glasses must have different refractive indices, but each lens must be  homogenous in composition. Optical glasses are generally divided into: crowns and  flints.  Crown glass  has a low index of refraction, while  flint glass  contains lead oxide  (PbO) that gives it a high index of refraction.  

# 7.4.3  GLASS- CERAMICS  

Glass-ceramics are a class of ceramic material produced by conversion of glass into   a  polycrystalline structure through heat treatment. The proportion of crystalline phase  in the final product typically ranges between $90\%$  and $98\%$ , with the remain- der being  unconverted vitreous material. Grain size is usually between 0.1 and  $1.0\ m\mathrm{m}$  (4 and 40  $m$ -in), significantly smaller than the grain size of conventional ceramics. This fine  crystal microstructure makes glass-ceramics much stronger than the glasses from  which they are derived. Also, due to their crystal structure, glass-ceramics are opaque  (usually gray or white) rather than clear.  

The processing sequence for glass-ceramics is as follows: (1) The first step in-  volves heating and forming operations used in glassworking (Section 12.2) to create  the desired product geometry. Glass shaping methods are generally more economi- cal  than pressing and sintering to shape traditional and new ceramics made from powders.  (2) The product is cooled. (3) The glass is reheated to a temperature suf- ficient to cause  a dense network of crystal nuclei to form throughout the material. It is the high density  of nucleation sites that inhibits grain growth of individual crystals, thus leading  ultimately to the fine grain size in the glass-ceramic material. The key to the propensity  for nucleation is the presence of small amounts of nucleating agents in the glass  composition. Common nucleating agents are  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ ,  $\mathrm{P}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{5}$ , and  $\mathrm{ZrO}_{2}$ . (4) Once  nucleation is initiated, the heat treatment is continued at a higher temperature to cause  growth of the crystalline phases.  

Several examples of glass-ceramic systems and typical compositions are listed  in Table 7.5. The  $\mathrm{Li}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{-}\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\mathrm{-}\mathrm{SiO}$ 2  system is the most important commercially; it  includes Corning Ware (Pyroceram), the familiar product of the Corning Glass Works.

The significant advantages of glass-ceramics include (1) efficiency of processing  in the glassy state, (2) close dimensional control over the final product shape, and (3)  good  mechanical and physical properties. Properties include high strength (stronger than  glass), absence of porosity, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and high re-  sistance to thermal shock. These properties have resulted in applications in cooking  ware, heat exchangers, and missile radomes. Certain systems (e.g.,  $\mathrm{MgO-Al_{2}O_{3}-S i O}$ 2 system) are also characterized by high electrical resistance, suitable for electrical  and electronics applications.

What is the predominant chemical compound in almost all glass products?,Answer. Silica - SiO2.,"The predominant chemical compound in almost all glass products is silica (\(\text{SiO}_2\)). Silica is the main component, making up 50% to 75% of the glass composition in most commercial glasses. Its ability to naturally transform into a glassy state upon cooling, combined with its low thermal expansion and resistance to thermal shock, makes it an ideal material for a wide range of glass products.","Other simple tools  rigidity had been attained in the product, a cup-shaped were utilized to add the stem and/or base to the object.  vessel.

# 7.4.1 CHEMISTRY AND PROPERTIES OF GLASS  

The principal ingredient in virtually all glasses is  silica  $(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ ), most commonly found  as the mineral quartz in sandstone and silica sand. Quartz occurs naturally as a crys-  talline substance; but when melted and then cooled, it forms vitreous silica. Silica glass  has a very low thermal expansion coefficient and is therefore quite resistant to  thermal shock. These properties are ideal for elevated temperature applications;  accordingly, Pyrex and chemical glassware designed for heating are made with high  proportions of silica glass.  

In order to reduce the melting point of glass for easier processing, and to con-  trol properties, the composition of most commercial glasses includes other oxides  as well as silica. Silica remains as the main component in these glass products, usu-  ally comprising  $50\%$  to  $75\%$  of total chemistry. The reason  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  is used so widely  in these compositions is because it is the best  glass former . It naturally transforms into  a glassy state upon cooling from the liquid, whereas most ceramics crystallize upon  solidification. Table 7.4 lists typical chemistries for some common glasses. The  additional ingredients are contained in a solid solution with  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ , and each has a  function: (1) acting as flux (promoting fusion) during heating; (2) increasing fluidity  in the molten glass for processing; (3) retarding  devitrification —the tendency to  crystallize from the glassy state; (4) reducing thermal expansion in the final product;   (5) improving the chemical resistance against attack by acids, basic substances, or  water; (6) adding color to the glass; and (7) altering the index of refraction for opti-  cal applications (e.g., lenses).  

# 7.4.2  GLASS  PRODUCTS  

Following is a list of the major categories of glass products. The roles played by the  different ingredients are examined in Table 7.4 as these products are discussed.  

Window Glass  This glass is represented by two chemistries in Table 7.4: (1) soda-  lime glass and (2) window glass. The soda-lime formula dates back to the glass-blow-  ing industry of the 1800s and earlier. It was (and is) made by mixing soda  $\mathrm{(Na_{2}O)}$  and  lime (CaO) with silica $\left(\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\right)$  as the major ingredient. The blending of ingredients has  evolved empirically to achieve a balance between avoiding crystallization during

What are the three basic steps in the glassworking sequence?,"Answer. (1) raw materials preparation and melting, (2) shaping, and (3) heat treatment. Finishing operations (e.g., grinding, polishing, etching) are performed on some glass products, if needed.","The three basic steps in the glassworking sequence are:

1. **Preparation of Raw Materials and Melting**:
   - This involves gathering and preparing the raw materials, primarily silica from quartz sand. The sand is washed and classified to ensure it is free from impurities and of the correct particle size. Additional materials like soda ash and limestone are mixed in correct proportions. The mixture, or ""charge,"" is melted in a furnace to form molten glass.

2. **Shaping**:
   - The molten glass is shaped into the desired form while in its viscous state. Various shaping methods are used depending on the product being made, such as casting, pressing-and-blowing for bottles, and rolling for flat glass. The glass is manipulated while it is highly plastic and fluid.

3. **Heat Treatment and Finishing**:
   - This step involves the annealing of glass to remove internal stresses. Further finishing processes may include cutting, polishing, and coating to achieve the desired properties and appearance. This step is crucial for ensuring the durability and quality of the final glass product.","# Glassworking

12.4 Product Design Considerations  

Glass products are commercially manufactured in an  almost unlimited variety of shapes. Many are produced  in very large quantities, such as light bulbs, beverage  bottles, and window glass. Others, such as giant tele- scope lenses, are made individually.  

Glass is one of three basic types of ceramics (Chap- ter 7). It is distinguished by its noncrystalline (vitreous)  structure, whereas the other ceramic materials have  a crystalline structure. The methods by which glass is  shaped into useful products are quite different from  those used for the other types. In glassworking, the  principal starting material is silica  $(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ ; this is usually  combined with other oxide ceramics that form glasses.  The starting material is heated to transform it from a  hard solid into a viscous liquid; it is then shaped into  the desired geometry while in this highly plastic or ﬂ  uid  condition. When cooled and hard, the material remains  in the glassy state rather than crystallizing.  

The typical manufacturing sequence in glassworking  consists of the steps pictured in Figure 12.1. Shaping is  accomplished by various processes, including casting,  pressing-and-blowing (to produce bottles and other  containers), and rolling (to make plate glass). A ﬁ  nish- ing step is required for certain products.

# Raw Materials  Preparation and  Melting  

The main component in nearly all glasses is silica, the  primary source of which is natural quartz in sand. The  sand must be washed and classiﬁ  ed. Washing removes  impurities such as clay and certain minerals that would  cause undesirable coloring of the glass.  Classifying  the  sand means grouping the grains according to size. The  most desirable particle size for glassmaking is in the  range of 0.1 to $0.6\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.004–0.025 in) [3]. The various  other components, such as soda ash (source of  $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{l}$ ),  limestone (source of  $\mathrm{CaO}$ ), aluminum oxide, potash

(source of  $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ ), and other minerals are added in the proper proportions to achieve  the desired composition. The mixing is usually done in batches, in amounts that are  compatible with the capacities of available melting furnaces.  

Recycled glass is usually added to the mixture in modern practice. In addition  to preserving the environment, recycled glass facilitates melting. Depending on the  amount of waste glass available and the speciﬁ  cations of the ﬁ  nal composition, the  proportion of recycled glass may be up to $100\%$ .  

The batch of starting materials to be melted is referred to as a  charge , and the pro- cedure of loading it into the melting furnace is called  charging  the furnace. Glass- melting furnaces can be divided into the following types [3]: (1)  pot furnaces —  ceramic pots of limited capacity in which melting occurs by heating the walls of the  pot; (2)  day tanks —larger capacity vessels for batch production in which heating is  done by burning fuels above the charge; (3)  continuous tank furnaces —long tank  furnaces in which raw materials are fed in one end, and melted as they move to the  other end where molten glass is drawn out for high production; and (4)  electric fur- naces  of various designs for a wide range of production rates.

Melting furnace for glassworking can be divided into four types. Name three of the four types.,"Answer. The four types are: (1) pot furnaces, (2) day tanks, (3) continuous tank furnaces, and (4) electric furnaces.","The three types of glass-melting furnaces are:

1. **Pot Furnaces** - These are ceramic pots with limited capacity where melting occurs by heating the walls of the pot.
2. **Day Tanks** - Larger capacity vessels used for batch production; heating is done by burning fuels above the charge.
3. **Continuous Tank Furnaces** - Long tank furnaces where raw materials are fed in one end and melted as they move to the other end, allowing for high production rates.","The batch of starting materials to be melted is referred to as a  charge , and the pro- cedure of loading it into the melting furnace is called  charging  the furnace.

Glass melting is generally carried out at temperatures around  $1500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to  $1600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ $(2700^{\circ}\mathrm{F}{-}2900^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ). The melting cycle for a typical charge takes 24 to 48 hours. This  is the time required for all of the sand grains to become a clear liquid and for the  molten glass to be reﬁ  ned and cooled to the appropriate temperature for working.  Molten glass is a viscous liquid, the viscosity being inversely related to temperature.  Because the shaping operation immediately follows the melting cycle, the tempera- ture at which the glass is tapped from the furnace depends on the viscosity required  for the subsequent process.  

#  Shaping Processes in Glassworking  

The major categories of glass products were identiﬁ  ed in Section 7.4.2 as window  glass, containers, light bulbs, laboratory glassware, glass ﬁ  bers, and optical glass. De- spite the variety represented by this list, the shaping processes to fabricate these  products can be grouped into only three categories: (1) discrete processes for piece  ware, which includes bottles, light bulbs, and other individual items; (2) continuous  processes for making ﬂ  at glass (sheet and plate glass for windows) and tubing (for  laboratory ware and ﬂ  uorescent lights); and (3) ﬁ  ber-making processes to produce  ﬁ  bers for insulation, ﬁ  berglass composite materials, and ﬁ  ber optics.  

# 12.2.1  SHAPING OF PIECE WARE  

The ancient methods of hand-working glass, such as glass blowing, were brieﬂ  y  described in Historical Note 7.3. Handicraft methods are still employed today for  making glassware items of high value in small quantities. Most of the processes

discussed in this section are highly mechanized technologies for producing discrete  pieces such as jars, bottles, and light bulbs in high quantities.  

Spinning  Glass spinning is similar to  centrifugal casting  of metals, and is also  known by that name in glassworking. It is used to produce funnel-shaped compo- nents such as the back sections of cathode ray tubes for televisions and computer  monitors. The setup is pictured in Figure 12.2. A gob of molten glass is dropped into  a conical mold made of steel. The mold is rotated so that centrifugal force causes  the glass to ﬂ  ow upward and spread itself on the mold surface. The faceplate (i.e.,  the front viewing screen) is later assembled to the funnel using a sealing glass of low  melting point.  

Pressing  This is a widely used process for mass producing glass pieces such as dishes,  bake ware, headlight lenses, TV tube faceplates, and similar items that are relatively  ﬂ  at. The process is illustrated and described in Figure 12.3. The large quantities of most  pressed products justify a high level of automation in this production sequence.

Describe the spinning process in glassworking.,"Answer. Spinning in glassworking is similar to centrifugal casting in metalworking. A gob of molten glass is dropped in to a conical mold which spins, causing centrifugal force to spread the glass upward onto the mold surface.","The spinning process in glassworking, often referred to as centrifugal casting or spinning, involves shaping a gob of hot glass inside a rotating mold. Here's a detailed description of the process:

1. **Preparation**: A gob of molten glass is placed into a mold, which can be open or partially closed, depending on the desired shape.

2. **Rotation**: The mold begins to rotate at high speed. The centrifugal force generated by the spinning action causes the molten glass to spread and adhere to the interior walls of the mold. This force ensures an even distribution and the creation of a uniform shape.

3. **Shaping**: As the mold spins, the glass takes the shape of the mold’s interior. The centrifugal force assists in forming symmetrical shapes, which are often used to create round objects like light bulbs, lenses, or other hollow glassware.

4. **Cooling**: Once the desired shape is achieved, the glass is allowed to cool, sometimes assisted by air. The cooling phase solidifies the glass, allowing the molded item to retain its shape after the mold stops rotating.

5. **Finishing**: The cooled glass item is removed from the mold. It may undergo additional processes such as cutting, grinding, or polishing to achieve the final product specifications.

This process is advantageous for producing hollow or symmetrical glass components efficiently, providing high precision and minimizing material waste.","The rolled glass sheet must later be ground and polished  for parallelism and smoothness.

FIGURE 12.7  The ﬂ  oat  process for producing  sheet glass.  

Float Process  This process was developed in the late 1950s. Its advantage over  other methods such as rolling is that it obtains smooth surfaces that need no sub- sequent ﬁ  nishing. In the  ﬂ  oat process , illustrated in Figure 12.7, the glass ﬂ  ows di- rectly from its melting furnace onto the surface of a molten tin bath. The highly ﬂ  uid  glass spreads evenly across the molten tin surface, achieving a uniform thickness and  smoothness. After moving into a cooler region of the bath, the glass hardens and  travels through an annealing furnace, after which it is cut to size.  

Drawing of Glass Tubes  Glass tubing is manufactured by a drawing process  known as the  Danner process , illustrated in Figure 12.8.

During hard- ening, the glass tube is supported by a series of rollers extending about  $30\:\mathrm{m}$  (100 ft)  beyond the mandrel. The continuous tubing is then cut into standard lengths.  Tubular glass products include laboratory glassware, ﬂ  uorescent light tubes, and  thermometers.  

# 12.2.3  FORMING OF GLASS FIBERS  

Glass ﬁ  bers are used in applications ranging from insulation wool to ﬁ  ber optics  communications lines (Section 7.4.2). Glass ﬁ  ber products can be divided into two  categories [6]: (1) ﬁ  brous glass for thermal insulation, acoustical insulation, and air  ﬁ  ltration, in which the ﬁ  bers are in a random, wool-like condition; and (2) long, con- tinuous ﬁ  laments suitable for ﬁ  ber-reinforced plastics, yarns and fabrics, and ﬁ  ber  optics. Different production methods are used for the two categories. Two methods  are described in the following paragraphs, representing each of the product catego- ries, respectively.  

Centrifugal Spraying  In a typical process for making glass wool, molten glass  ﬂ  ows into a rotating bowl with many small oriﬁ  ces around its periphery. Centrifugal  force causes the glass to ﬂ  ow through the holes to become a ﬁ  brous mass suitable for  thermal and acoustical insulation.  

Drawing of Continuous Filaments  In this process, illustrated in Figure 12.9,  continuous glass ﬁ  bers of small diameter (lower size limit is around  $0.0025~\mathrm{mm}$  or  0.0001 in) are produced by drawing strands of molten glass through small oriﬁ  ces in

What is the main difference between the press-and-blow and the blow-and-blow shaping processes in glassworking?,"Answer. In the press-and-blow process, the initial forming step is pressing of the part, while the first step in the blow-and-blow process is blowing.","The main difference between the press-and-blow and the blow-and-blow shaping processes in glassworking lies in the initial step of forming the glass shape.

1. **Press-and-Blow Method**: 
   - The process starts with a pressing operation. A molten gob of glass is placed into a mold and a plunger is used to press it into a preliminary shape known as a parison. 
   - This initial pressing step helps in creating larger and uniformly shaped openings, making it suitable for wide-mouth containers.
   - After pressing, the parison is transferred to a blow mold where air is used to expand the glass into its final shape.

2. **Blow-and-Blow Method**: 
   - This method involves two successive blowing steps without pressing. The molten glass is first blown into a preliminary parison shape inside an inverted mold.
   - The partially formed parison is reoriented and transferred to a second blow mold, where it is blown into the final shape.
   - It is typically used for containers with smaller mouths, such as bottles.

In summary, the press-and-blow method utilizes an initial pressing step to form the parison before blowing, while the blow-and-blow method uses two blowing steps without pressing to achieve the final shape.","A gob of molten glass is dropped into  a conical mold made of steel. The mold is rotated so that centrifugal force causes  the glass to ﬂ  ow upward and spread itself on the mold surface. The faceplate (i.e.,  the front viewing screen) is later assembled to the funnel using a sealing glass of low  melting point.  

Pressing  This is a widely used process for mass producing glass pieces such as dishes,  bake ware, headlight lenses, TV tube faceplates, and similar items that are relatively  ﬂ  at.

There are several ways of shaping plate or sheet glass. Name and briefly describe one of them.,"Answer. The methods described in this test are: (1) rolling, in which the hot glass is squeezed between opposing cylindrical rolls; and (2) the float process, in which the melted glass flows onto a molten tin surface to achieve uniform thickness and smoothness.","One method for shaping plate or sheet glass is the Float Process. Developed in the late 1950s, the float process involves pouring molten glass onto a bed of molten tin. The glass spreads out and forms a uniform thickness due to its natural surface tension and the molten tin’s perfectly flat surface. As the glass flows over the tin, it forms a ribbon and cools down in a controlled atmosphere. This process results in high-quality glass with smooth surfaces and requires no additional finishing. The glass is then annealed to relieve internal stresses before being cut into desired sizes. The float process is widely used today because of its ability to produce large volumes of flat glass with consistent thickness and optical clarity.","Reheating is sometimes required between blowing steps.

Smaller lenses  are usually made by pressing, discussed above.  

# 12.2.2  SHAPING OF FLAT AND TUBULAR GLASS  

Two methods for making plate glass and one method for producing tube stock are  described here. They are continuous processes, in which long sections of ﬂ  at window  glass or glass tubing are made and later cut into appropriate sizes and lengths. They  are modern technologies in contrast to the ancient method described in Historical  Note 12.1.  

# Historical Note 12.1  Ancient methods of making ﬂ  at glass  [7]  

Glass windows have been used in buildings for many  centuries. The oldest process for making ﬂ  at window  glass was by manual glass blowing. The procedure  consisted of the following: (1) a glass globe was blown  on a blowpipe; (2) a portion of the globe was made  to stick to the end of a “punty, ” a metal rod used by  glassblowers, and then detached from the blowpipe;  and (3) after reheating the glass, the punty was rotated  with sufﬁ  cient speed for centrifugal force to shape the  open globe into a ﬂ  at disk. The disk, whose maximum  possible size was only about  $1\,\mathrm{~m~}$  (3 ft), was later cut  into small panes for windows.  

At the center of the disk, where the glass was  attached to the punty during the third step in the  process, a lump would tend to form that had the ap- pearance of a crown. The name “crown glass” was  derived from this resemblance. Lenses for spectacles  were ground from glass made by this method. Today,  the name crown glass is still used for certain types  of optical and ophthalmic glass, even though the an- cient method has been replaced by modern produc- tion technology.  

Rolling of Flat Plate  Flat plate glass can be produced by rolling, as illustrated in  Figure 12.6. The starting glass, in a suitably plastic condition from the furnace, is  squeezed through opposing rolls whose separation determines the thickness of the  sheet. The rolling operation is usually set up so that the ﬂ  at glass is moved directly  into an annealing furnace. The rolled glass sheet must later be ground and polished  for parallelism and smoothness.

Describe the Danner process?,"Answer. In the Danner process, molten glass flows around a rotating hollow mandrel through which air is blown while the glass is being drawn. The temperature of the air and its volumetric flow rate as well as the drawing velocity determine the diameter and wall thickness of the tubular cross-section. During hardening, the glass tube is supported by a series of rollers extending beyond the mandrel.","The Danner process is a method used in the manufacturing of glass tubing. It involves drawing molten glass through a rotating inclined tube, known as the Danner mandrel. Here’s a detailed explanation of the process:

1. **Introduction of Molten Glass**: Molten glass flows onto the Danner mandrel, which rotates at a controlled speed. The mandrel is slightly inclined and has a central air supply to aid in shaping the tube.

2. **Formation of Glass Tube**: As the mandrel rotates, the molten glass spreads and forms a continuous, tubular shape. The rotation ensures uniform thickness and even distribution of the glass material.

3. **Control of Dimensions**: The diameter and thickness of the glass tube are controlled by adjusting the speed of rotation, the inclination of the mandrel, and the rate of air supply through the mandrel.

4. **Drawing and Cooling**: The newly formed glass tube is drawn out and allowed to cool gradually. Controlled cooling is crucial to prevent thermal stress and ensure structural integrity.

5. **Cutting and Finishing**: Once the glass tube reaches the desired length, it is cut and subjected to further finishing processes, such as annealing, to relieve internal stresses.

The Danner process is advantageous for producing long, continuous lengths of glass tubing with a consistent diameter, making it ideal for applications like laboratory glassware, thermometers, and fluorescent lamp envelopes.","The advantage of the Guerin process is the relatively low cost of the tooling.  The form block can be made of wood, plastic, or other materials that are easy to  shape, and the rubber pad can be used with different form blocks. These factors

make rubber forming attractive in small-quantity production, such as the aircraft  industry, where the process was developed.  

Hydroforming  Hydroforming is similar to the Guerin process; the difference  is that it substitutes a rubber diaphragm ﬁ  lled with hydraulic ﬂ  uid in place of the  thick rubber pad, as illustrated in Figure 19.29. This allows the pressure that forms  the work part to be increased—to around  $100\;\mathrm{MPa}$  ( $\cdot15{,}000\ \mathrm{lb/in}^{2}\$ ) —thus prevent- ing wrinkling in deep formed parts. In fact, deeper draws can be achieved with the  hydroform process than with conventional deep drawing. This is because the uni- form pressure in hydroforming forces the work to contact the punch throughout its  length, thus increasing friction and reducing the tensile stresses that cause tearing at  the base of the drawn cup.  

#  Dies and Presses for Sheet-Metal Processes  

This section examines the punch-and-die tooling and production equipment used in  conventional sheet-metal processing.  

# 19.5.1  DIES  

Nearly all of the preceding pressworking operations are performed with conventional  punch-and-die tooling. The tooling is referred to as a  die . It is custom-  designed for  the particular part to be produced. The term  stamping die  is sometimes used for high- production dies. Typical materials for stamping dies are tool steel types D, A, O, and  S (Table 6.5).  

Components of a Stamping Die  The components of a stamping die to perform  a simple blanking operation are illustrated in Figure 19.30. The working components  are the  punch  and  die , which perform the cutting operation. They are attached to

the upper and lower portions of the  die set , respectively called the  punch holder  (or  upper shoe ) and  die holder  ( lower shoe ). The die set also includes guide pins and  bushings to ensure proper alignment between the punch and die during the stamping  operation. The die holder is attached to the base of the press, and the punch holder is  attached to the ram. Actuation of the ram accomplishes the pressworking operation.  

In addition to these components, a die used for blanking or hole-punching must  include a means of preventing the sheet metal from sticking to the punch when it is  retracted upward after the operation. The newly created hole in the stock is the same  size as the punch, and it tends to cling to the punch on its withdrawal. The device  in the die that strips the sheet metal from the punch is called a  stripper . It is often  a simple plate attached to the die as in Figure 19.30, with a hole slightly larger than  the punch diameter.  

For dies that process strips or coils of sheet metal, a device is required to stop the  sheet metal as it advances through the die between press cycles.

Two processes for forming glass fibers are discussed in the text. Name and briefly describe one of them.,"Answer. The two processes in the text are: (1) drawing, in which fine glass fibers are pulled through small orifices in a heated plate; and (2) centrifugal spraying, in which molten glass is forced to flow through small orifices in a rapidly rotating bowl to form glass fibers.","One common process for forming glass fibers is the ""Continuous Filament Process."" In this method, molten glass is extruded through small holes in a bushing made of precious metals. As the threads of glass emerge, they are rapidly cooled and solidified. The continuous filaments are then gathered into strands and wound onto spools for further processing. This method is efficient for producing large volumes of glass fibers that are uniform in diameter and is widely used in applications such as fiberglass insulation and reinforced composite materials.","# Glassworking

12.4 Product Design Considerations  

Glass products are commercially manufactured in an  almost unlimited variety of shapes. Many are produced  in very large quantities, such as light bulbs, beverage  bottles, and window glass. Others, such as giant tele- scope lenses, are made individually.  

Glass is one of three basic types of ceramics (Chap- ter 7). It is distinguished by its noncrystalline (vitreous)  structure, whereas the other ceramic materials have  a crystalline structure. The methods by which glass is  shaped into useful products are quite different from  those used for the other types. In glassworking, the  principal starting material is silica  $(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ ; this is usually  combined with other oxide ceramics that form glasses.  The starting material is heated to transform it from a  hard solid into a viscous liquid; it is then shaped into  the desired geometry while in this highly plastic or ﬂ  uid  condition. When cooled and hard, the material remains  in the glassy state rather than crystallizing.  

The typical manufacturing sequence in glassworking  consists of the steps pictured in Figure 12.1. Shaping is  accomplished by various processes, including casting,  pressing-and-blowing (to produce bottles and other  containers), and rolling (to make plate glass). A ﬁ  nish- ing step is required for certain products.

# Raw Materials  Preparation and  Melting  

The main component in nearly all glasses is silica, the  primary source of which is natural quartz in sand. The  sand must be washed and classiﬁ  ed. Washing removes  impurities such as clay and certain minerals that would  cause undesirable coloring of the glass.  Classifying  the  sand means grouping the grains according to size. The  most desirable particle size for glassmaking is in the  range of 0.1 to $0.6\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.004–0.025 in) [3]. The various  other components, such as soda ash (source of  $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{l}$ ),  limestone (source of  $\mathrm{CaO}$ ), aluminum oxide, potash

(source of  $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ ), and other minerals are added in the proper proportions to achieve  the desired composition. The mixing is usually done in batches, in amounts that are  compatible with the capacities of available melting furnaces.  

Recycled glass is usually added to the mixture in modern practice. In addition  to preserving the environment, recycled glass facilitates melting. Depending on the  amount of waste glass available and the speciﬁ  cations of the ﬁ  nal composition, the  proportion of recycled glass may be up to $100\%$ .  

The batch of starting materials to be melted is referred to as a  charge , and the pro- cedure of loading it into the melting furnace is called  charging  the furnace. Glass- melting furnaces can be divided into the following types [3]: (1)  pot furnaces —  ceramic pots of limited capacity in which melting occurs by heating the walls of the  pot; (2)  day tanks —larger capacity vessels for batch production in which heating is  done by burning fuels above the charge; (3)  continuous tank furnaces —long tank  furnaces in which raw materials are fed in one end, and melted as they move to the  other end where molten glass is drawn out for high production; and (4)  electric fur- naces  of various designs for a wide range of production rates.

What is the purpose of annealing in glassworking?,Answer. Annealing is performed on glass to remove internal stresses that result from shaping and solidification.,"The purpose of annealing in glassworking is to relieve internal stresses in glass products that form during the manufacturing process. These internal stresses can weaken the glass, making it more prone to cracking or breaking under pressure. Annealing involves heating the glass to an elevated temperature, typically around \(500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) (or \(900^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\)), and holding it at that temperature to allow for stress relaxation. The glass is then slowly cooled to suppress the formation of new stresses, followed by a more rapid cooling to room temperature.

This controlled process of heating and cooling helps to eliminate temperature gradients and internal stress, thereby improving the strength and structural integrity of the glass. In modern glass factories, annealing is typically performed in lehrs, which are tunnel-like furnaces where glass products move slowly through a controlled thermal environment. The annealing process is crucial for producing high-quality glass products with enhanced durability.","Drawing of Continuous Filaments  In this process, illustrated in Figure 12.9,  continuous glass ﬁ  bers of small diameter (lower size limit is around  $0.0025~\mathrm{mm}$  or  0.0001 in) are produced by drawing strands of molten glass through small oriﬁ  ces in  

![](images/e1e4c821dae73b6f342df55b4ed2db4a27612da7df8041b383997d82deaa4389.jpg)  

a heated plate made of a platinum alloy. The plate may have several hundred holes,  each making one ﬁ  ber. The individual ﬁ  bers are collected into a strand by reeling  them onto a spool. Before spooling, the ﬁ  bers are coated with various chemicals  to lubricate and protect them. Drawing speeds of around  $50\;\mathrm{m/s}$   $(10{,}000\;\mathrm{ft/min})$ ) or  more are not unusual.  

#  Heat Treatment and Finishing  

Heat treatment of the glass product is the third step in the glassworking sequence.  For some products, additional ﬁ  nishing operations are performed.  

# 12.3.1  HEAT TREATMENT  

Glass-ceramics were discussed in Section 7.4.3. This unique material is made by a  special heat treatment that transforms most of the vitreous state into a polycrys- talline ceramic. Other heat treatments performed on glass cause changes that are  less dramatic technologically but perhaps more important commercially; examples  include annealing and tempering.  

Annealing  Glass products usually have undesirable internal stresses after form- ing, which reduce their strength. Annealing is done to relieve these stresses; the  treatment therefore has the same function in glassworking as it does in metalwork- ing.  Annealing  involves heating the glass to an elevated temperature and holding  it for a certain period to eliminate stresses and temperature gradients, then slowly  cooling the glass to suppress stress formation, followed by more rapid cooling to  room temperature. Common annealing temperatures are around $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\left(900^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\right)$ . The  length of time the product is held at the temperature, as well as the heating and cool- ing rates during the cycle, depend on thickness of the glass, the usual rule being that  the required annealing time varies with the square of thickness.  

Annealing in modern glass factories is performed in tunnel-like furnaces, called  lehrs , in which the products ﬂ  ow slowly through the hot chamber on conveyors.  Burners are located only at the front end of the chamber, so that the glass experi- ences the required heating and cooling cycle.  

Tempered Glass and Related Products  A beneﬁ  cial internal stress pattern can be  developed in glass products by a heat treatment known as  tempering , and the result- ing material is called  tempered glass . As in the treatment of hardened steel, tempering  increases the toughness of glass. The process involves heating the glass to a tempera- ture somewhat above its annealing temperature and into the plastic range, followed by  quenching of the surfaces, usually with air jets. When the surfaces cool, they contract  and harden while the interior is still plastic and compliant. As the internal glass slowly  cools, it contracts, thus putting the hard surfaces in compression. Like other ceramics,  glass is much stronger when subjected to compressive stresses than tensile stresses. Ac- cordingly, tempered glass is much more resistant to scratching and breaking because  of the compressive stresses on its surfaces. Applications include windows for tall build- ings, all-glass doors, safety glasses, and other products requiring toughened glass.  

When tempered glass fails, it does so by shattering into numerous small frag- ments that are less likely to cut someone than conventional (annealed) window  glass.   Interestingly, automobile windshields are not made of tempered glass, because  

of the danger posed to the driver by this fragmentation. Instead, conventional glass  is used; however, it is fabricated by sandwiching two pieces of glass on either side of  a tough polymer sheet. Should this  laminated glass  fracture, the glass splinters are  retained by the polymer sheet and the windshield remains relatively transparent.

Describe how a piece of glass is heat treated to produce tempered glass.,"Answer. The glass is heated to a temperature above the annealing temperature and the surfaces are then quenched by air jets to cool and harden them while the interior of the piece remains plastic; as the interior cools and contracts, it puts the previously hardened surfaces in compression, which strengthens it.","To produce tempered glass, a piece of glass undergoes a specific heat treatment process designed to enhance its strength and toughness. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Heating**: The glass is heated to a temperature just above its annealing point, typically in the range where the glass becomes plastic but not fluid. This is higher than the typical annealing temperature, allowing the entire thickness of the glass to heat uniformly and soften slightly.

2. **Quenching**: The heated glass is then rapidly cooled or quenched, usually using high-pressure air jets directed at its surfaces. This rapid cooling primarily affects the surfaces of the glass, causing them to harden quickly while the interior remains more pliable.

3. **Internal Stress Development**: As the interior of the glass eventually cools and contracts, it creates a compressive stress layer on the surfaces of the glass. This stress pattern is beneficial because glass is significantly stronger under compression than tension.

The result of this process is tempered glass, which has improved resistance to impact, scratching, and thermal stress compared to untreated glass. Additionally, tempered glass is safer upon failure as it breaks into small, less dangerous fragments, minimizing the risk of injury. This makes it ideal for applications like building windows, glass doors, and safety glass.","Drawing of Continuous Filaments  In this process, illustrated in Figure 12.9,  continuous glass ﬁ  bers of small diameter (lower size limit is around  $0.0025~\mathrm{mm}$  or  0.0001 in) are produced by drawing strands of molten glass through small oriﬁ  ces in

In the event of a fracture, the polymer layer holds the glass shards together, allowing the windshield to remain largely intact and relatively transparent. This design minimizes the risk of injury from flying glass fragments, unlike tempered glass, which shatters into small pieces. The polymer layer also provides additional strength and safety features, crucial for automotive applications.","Applications include windows for tall build- ings, all-glass doors, safety glasses, and other products requiring toughened glass.  

When tempered glass fails, it does so by shattering into numerous small frag- ments that are less likely to cut someone than conventional (annealed) window  glass.   Interestingly, automobile windshields are not made of tempered glass, because  

of the danger posed to the driver by this fragmentation. Instead, conventional glass  is used; however, it is fabricated by sandwiching two pieces of glass on either side of  a tough polymer sheet. Should this  laminated glass  fracture, the glass splinters are  retained by the polymer sheet and the windshield remains relatively transparent.  

# 12.3.2  FINISHING  

Finishing operations are sometimes required for glassware products. These sec- ondary operations include grinding, polishing, and cutting. When glass sheets are  produced by drawing and rolling, the opposite sides are not necessarily parallel, and  the surfaces contain defects and scratch marks caused by the use of hard tooling on  soft glass. The glass sheets must be ground and polished for most commercial ap- plications. In pressing and blowing operations when split dies are used, polishing is  often required to remove the seam marks from the container product.  

In continuous glassworking processes, such as plate and tube production, the con- tinuous sections must be cut into smaller pieces. This is accomplished by ﬁ  rst scoring  the glass with a glass-cutting wheel or cutting diamond and then breaking the section  along the score line. Cutting is generally done as the glass exits the annealing lehr.  

Decorative and surface processes are performed on certain glassware products.  These processes include mechanical cutting and polishing operations; sandblasting;  chemical etching (with hydroﬂ  uoric acid, often in combination with other chemi- cals); and coating (for example, coating of plate glass with aluminum or silver to  produce mirrors).

What are some of the design recommendations for glass parts?,"Answer. The guidelines are: (1) subject ceramic parts to compressive, not tensile loads; (2) ceramics are brittle, so avoid impact loading; (3) use large radii on inside and outside corners; (4) screw threads should be course.","The design recommendations for glass parts include:

1. **Optical Properties**: Glass is transparent and possesses unique optical properties such as light transmittance and magnification. Therefore, it is ideal for applications requiring transparency and other optical characteristics.

2. **Strength in Compression**: Glass is significantly stronger in compression than in tension. When designing glass components, they should be subjected to compressive stresses rather than tensile stresses to prevent fracture.

3. **Brittleness**: Given the brittle nature of glass, it should not be used in applications involving impact loading or high stresses that can lead to fractures.

4. **Thermal Expansion**: Certain glass compositions have very low thermal expansion coefficients, making them resistant to thermal shock. These should be selected for applications where thermal stability is critical, like cookware.

5. **Stress Concentration**: Edges and corners on glass parts should have large radii or chamfers to reduce stress concentration points, which can lead to cracks.

6. **Thread Inclusion**: Glass parts can include threads, especially with press-and-blow shaping processes. However, these threads should be coarse to maintain structural integrity.

Integrated circuits constitute the brains of an electronic  system, but the complete system consists of much more  than packaged ICs. The ICs and other components are  mounted and interconnected on printed circuit boards,  which in turn are interconnected and contained in a  chassis or cabinet. Chip packaging (Section 33.6) is  only part of the total electronic package. This chapter  considers the remaining levels of packaging and how  the packages are manufactured and assembled.  

# Electronics  Packaging  

The electronics package is the physical means by which  the components in a system are electrically inter- connected and interfaced to external devices; it includes  the mechanical structure that holds and protects the  circuitry. A well-designed electronics package serves  the following functions: (1) power distribution and sig- nal interconnection, (2) structural support, (3) circuit  protection from physical and chemical hazards in the  environment, (4) dissipation of heat generated by the  circuits, and (5) minimum delays in signal transmission  within the system.  

For complex systems containing many components  and interconnections, the electronics package is organ- ized into levels that comprise a  packaging hierarchy ,  illus  trated in Figure 34.1 and summarized in Table 34.1.  The lowest level is the  zero level , which refers to the  intra connections on the semiconductor chip. The pack- aged chip (chip carrier), consisting of the IC in a plas- tic or ceramic enclosure and connected to the package  leads, constitutes the  ﬁ  rst level of packaging .  

Packaged chips and other components are assembled  to a printed circuit board (PCB) using two technologies  (Section 33.6.1): (1)  surface-mount technology  (SMT)  

![](images/1e20e72922781b4cf2ccd18b84212143ea7a904759ad35c3b86dcb235827b20d.jpg)  

and (2)  through-hole technology , also known as  pin-in-hole  (PIH) technology. Today,  SMT is much more widely used in industry, especially for mass-produced products.  The chip package styles and assembly techniques are different for SMT and PIH. In  many cases, both assembly technologies are employed in the same board. Printed cir- cuit board assembly represents the  second level of packaging . Figure 34.2 shows two  PCB assemblies, illustrating both PIH and SMT types. Note the smaller component  sizes of the SMT board.

Identify the levels of packaging hierarchy in electronics.,"Answer. The levels are: (0) chip intraconnections, (1) chip to package, (2) component to PCB, (3) PCB to rack or chassis, and (4) wiring and cabling inside a cabinet.","The levels of packaging hierarchy in electronics are:

1. **Level 0**: Intraconnections on the semiconductor chip itself. This includes all the tiny interconnections within the integrated circuit (IC) on the chip.

2. **Level 1**: Chip-to-package interconnections, where the IC is connected to a chip carrier or package. The package may be made of plastic or ceramic, and it connects the chip to external circuitry via its leads.

3. **Level 2**: IC package to circuit board interconnections. This level involves assembling packaged chips and other components onto a printed circuit board (PCB) using technologies such as surface-mount technology (SMT) and through-hole technology (PIH).

4. **Level 3**: Circuit board to rack or chassis interconnections. Assembled PCBs are installed into a larger structure, like a rack, often by using a backplane for further interconnections between boards.

5. **Level 4**: Wiring and cabling connections within a cabinet or system, involving the mechanical framework that houses and protects the assembled electronic components.

These hierarchical levels are critical in ensuring effective electrical interconnection, structural support, protection, and heat dissipation within electronic systems.","# Electronics  Assembly and  Packaging

What is the difference between a track and a land on a printed circuit board?,"Answer. A track is a copper conducting path on a PCB, while a land is a small copper area for electrically attaching components.","On a printed circuit board (PCB), the main difference between a track and a land lies in their functions and locations:

1. **Track**: A track is a thin conducting path made of copper that runs across the surface of the PCB. Its primary function is to electrically connect various components on the board by providing a route for electrical signals. Tracks are essentially the ""wiring"" on the PCB, allowing current to flow between different parts.

2. **Land**: A land, on the other hand, is a larger copper area on the board. Lands are used to attach and electrically connect components to the PCB. They provide the surface onto which components are soldered. Lands are essential for maintaining physical and electrical contacts between the component leads and the board.

Both tracks and lands are crucial for the effective functioning of a PCB, with tracks forming the circuit pathways and lands serving as the connection points for components.","As track  widths became ﬁ  ner and ﬁ  ner, photolithography was  substituted for screen printing.  

Initial techniques to design the circuit masks involved  a manual inking procedure, in which the designer at- tempted to route the conducting tracks to provide the  required connections and avoid short circuits on a large  sheet of paper or vellum. This became more difﬁ  cult as  the number of components on the board increased and  the conducting lines interconnecting the components  became ﬁ  ner. Computer programs were developed to  aid the designer in solving the routing problem. How- ever, in many cases, it was impossible to ﬁ  nd a solu- tion with no intersecting tracks (short circuits). To solve  the problem, jumper wires were hand-soldered to the  board to make these connections. As the number of  jumper wires increased, the problem of human error  again appeared.

# 34.2.1  STRUCTURES, TYPES, AND MATERIALS FOR PCBs  

A  printed circuit board  (PCB), also called a  printed wiring board  (PWB), is a  laminated ﬂ  at panel of insulating material designed to provide electrical intercon- nections between electronic components attached to it. Interconnections are made  by thin conducting paths on the surface of the board or in alternating layers sand- wiched between layers of insulating material. The conducting paths are made of  copper and are called  tracks . Other copper areas, called  lands , are also available  on the board surface for attaching and electrically connecting components.  

Insulation materials in PCBs are usually polymer composites reinforced with  glass fabrics or paper. Polymers include epoxy (most widely used), phenolic, and  polyimide. E-glass is the usual ﬁ  ber in glass-reinforcing fabrics, especially in epoxy  PCBs; cotton paper is a common reinforcing layer for phenolic boards. The usual  thickness of the substrate layer is 0.8 to  $3.2~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.031–0.125 in), and copper foil  thickness is around  $0.04~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.0015 in).

A PCB is a laminated flat panel of insulating material to which electronic components are attached and electrically interconnected.,"A printed circuit board (PCB), also known as a printed wiring board (PWB), is a laminated flat panel made of insulating material. It is engineered to facilitate electrical connections between electronic components mounted onto it. The interconnections are established via thin copper conducting paths, referred to as tracks, which can be located on the surface of the board or embedded within alternating layers between insulating material. 

In addition to tracks, other copper areas known as lands are available on the board for the attachment and electrical connection of components. The insulating materials often involve polymer composites, typically reinforced with glass fabrics or paper. Common polymers include epoxy (the most widely used), phenolic, and polyimide, often using glass fibers like E-glass for reinforcement.

PCBs are categorized into three main types based on construction:

1. **Single-sided:** Featuring copper foil on one side of the insulating substrate.
2. **Double-sided:** Incorporating copper foil on both sides of the substrate.
3. **Multilayer:** Comprising multiple layers of conducting foils and insulating substrates, which accommodate more complex circuits by offering numerous conducting paths within the board.

These substrate layers are constructed with laminates bonded together for strength, rigidity, and to ensure resistance to warpage, maintain dimensional stability, and offer heat and flame resistance.","As track  widths became ﬁ  ner and ﬁ  ner, photolithography was  substituted for screen printing.

Name the three principal types of printed circuit board?,"Answer. The three types are: (1) single -sided board, (2) double -sided board, and (3) multilayer board.","The three principal types of printed circuit boards (PCBs) are:

1. **Single-Sided Board**: Copper foil is on only one side of the insulation substrate.
2. **Double-Sided Board**: Copper foil is on both sides of the substrate, allowing for more complex circuits.
3. **Multilayer Board**: Consists of alternating layers of copper and insulation, used for complex circuits requiring numerous interconnections. 

These structures are constructed using laminates of materials such as epoxy-glass sheets, ensuring they are strong, rigid, and capable of supporting the required electrical paths.","As track  widths became ﬁ  ner and ﬁ  ner, photolithography was  substituted for screen printing.

This became more difﬁ  cult as  the number of components on the board increased and  the conducting lines interconnecting the components  became ﬁ  ner. Computer programs were developed to  aid the designer in solving the routing problem. How- ever, in many cases, it was impossible to ﬁ  nd a solu- tion with no intersecting tracks (short circuits). To solve  the problem, jumper wires were hand-soldered to the  board to make these connections. As the number of  jumper wires increased, the problem of human error  again appeared.

# 34.2.1  STRUCTURES, TYPES, AND MATERIALS FOR PCBs  

A  printed circuit board  (PCB), also called a  printed wiring board  (PWB), is a  laminated ﬂ  at panel of insulating material designed to provide electrical intercon- nections between electronic components attached to it. Interconnections are made  by thin conducting paths on the surface of the board or in alternating layers sand- wiched between layers of insulating material. The conducting paths are made of  copper and are called  tracks . Other copper areas, called  lands , are also available  on the board surface for attaching and electrically connecting components.  

Insulation materials in PCBs are usually polymer composites reinforced with  glass fabrics or paper. Polymers include epoxy (most widely used), phenolic, and  polyimide. E-glass is the usual ﬁ  ber in glass-reinforcing fabrics, especially in epoxy  PCBs; cotton paper is a common reinforcing layer for phenolic boards. The usual  thickness of the substrate layer is 0.8 to  $3.2~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.031–0.125 in), and copper foil  thickness is around  $0.04~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.0015 in). The materials forming the PCB structure  must be electrically insulating, strong and rigid, resistant to warpage, dimensionally

stable, heat resistant, and ﬂ  ame retardant. Chemicals are often added to the polymer  composite to obtain the last two characteristics.  

There are three principal types of printed circuit board, shown in Figure 34.3:  (a)  single-sided  board, in which copper foil is only on one side of the insulation  substrate; (b)  double-sided  board, in which the copper foil is on both sides of the  substrate; and (c)  multilayer  board, consisting of alternating layers of conducting  foil and insulation. In all three structures, the insulation layers are constructed of  multiple laminates of epoxy-glass sheets (or other composite) bonded together to  form a strong and rigid structure. Multilayer boards are used for complex circuit  assemblies in which a large number of components must be interconnected with  many track routings, thus requiring more conducting paths than can be accommo- dated in one or two copper layers. Four layers is the most common multilayer con- ﬁ  guration, but boards with up to 24 conducting layers are produced.  

# 34.2.2  PRODUCTION OF THE STARTING BOARDS  

Single- and double-sided boards can be purchased from suppliers that specialize  in mass producing them in standard sizes. The boards are then custom-processed  by a circuit fabricator to create the speciﬁ  ed circuit pattern and board size for  a given application.

What is a via hole in a printed circuit board?,Answer. A via hole is a hole in the printed circuit board whose sides are plated with copper to serve as a conducting path from one side of a PCB to the other or between intermediate layers in a multilayer board.,"A via hole in a printed circuit board (PCB) is a small opening drilled and plated with conductive material, typically copper, that allows electrical connections between different layers of the PCB. In multilayer PCBs, via holes play a critical role in inter-layer connectivity, enabling the transfer of signals and power.

Vias are categorized into three main types:
1. **Through-hole vias:** These extend through the entire board, connecting the top and bottom layers and any intermediate layers.
2. **Blind vias:** These connect an outer layer to one or more inner layers but do not span the entire thickness of the PCB.
3. **Buried vias:** These are located entirely within the inner layers and do not reach the outer surfaces.

The process of creating via holes involves drilling and electroplating to ensure reliable electrical conductivity. Vias are essential for maintaining the compactness and functionality of modern electronic devices by facilitating complex routing of connections across multiple circuit layers.","Upper PCB  assembly is through- hole technology  (pin-in-hole) whereas  lower assembly is  mostly surface-mount  technology.

The assembled PCBs are, in turn, connected to a chassis or other framework; this  is the  third level of packaging . This third level may consist of a  rack  that holds the  boards, using wire cables to make the interconnections. In major electronic systems,  such as large computers, the PCBs are typically mounted onto a larger printed cir- cuit board called a  back plane , which has conduction paths to permit interconnec- tion between the smaller boards attached to it. This latter conﬁ  guration is known as  card-on-board  (COB) packaging, in which the smaller PCBs are called cards and  the back plane is the board.  

The  fourth level of packaging  consists of wiring and cabling inside the cabinet  that contains the electronic system. For systems of relatively low complexity, the  packaging may not include all of the possible levels in the hierarchy.  

A printed circuit board consists of one or more thin sheets of insulating material,  with thin copper lines on one or both surfaces that interconnect the components  attached to the board. In boards consisting of more than one layer, copper conduct- ing paths are interleaved between the layers. PCBs are used in packaged electronic  systems to hold components, provide electrical interconnections among them, and  make connections to external circuits. They have become standard building blocks  in virtually all electronic systems that contain packaged ICs and other components  (Historical Note 34.1). PCBs are so important and widely used because (1) they  provide a convenient structural platform for the components; (2) a board with cor- rectly routed interconnections can be mass produced consistently, without the varia- bility usually associated with hand wiring; (3) nearly all of the soldering connections  between components and the PCB can be accomplished in a one-step mechanized  

# Historical Note 34.1  Printed circuit boards  

Before printed circuit boards, electrical and electronic  components were manually fastened to a sheet-metal  chassis (usually aluminum) and then hand wired and  soldered to form the desired circuit. This was called  point-to-point construction. In the late 1950s, various  plastic boards became commercially available. These  boards, which provided electrical insulation, gradually  replaced the aluminum chassis.  The ﬁ  rst plastics were  phenolics, followed by glass-ﬁ  ber-reinforced epoxies.  The boards came with predrilled holes spaced at  standard intervals in both directions. This motivated  the use of electronic components that matched these  hole spacings.  The dual-in-line package evolved during  this period.  

The components in these circuit boards were hand- wired, which proved increasingly difﬁ  cult and prone to  human error as component densities increased and cir- cuits became more complex. The printed circuit board,  with etched copper foil on its surface to form the wiring  interconnections, was developed in the 1950s to solve  these problems with manual wiring. The printed circuit  boards during that period used through-hole technology,  and PCBs had to be drilled to accommodate the com- ponent leads.

What are the two basic resist coating methods for printed circuit boards?,"Answer. The two methods are: (1) screening, such as silk screening, and (2) photolithography.","The two basic resist coating methods for printed circuit boards (PCBs) are:

1. **Spin Coating**:
   - This method involves applying a liquid photoresist onto the center of the PCB and spinning the board at high speed. The centrifugal force spreads the resist evenly across the surface to achieve a uniform thickness. Spin coating is well-suited for achieving thin and consistent layers, typically used in semiconductor wafer processing.

2. **Curtain Coating**:
   - In curtain coating, a continuous curtain of liquid photoresist falls onto the moving PCB, coating it evenly. This method is efficient for mass production, especially for larger panels, as it can quickly cover a large surface area with minimal waste.

Each method has its advantages: spin coating provides excellent control over film thickness, critical for achieving high-resolution patterns, while curtain coating is more suitable for large-scale production and uniform coverage.","Two types of photoresists are available: positive and negative. A  positive resist   becomes more soluble in developing solutions after exposure to light. A  negative  resist  becomes less soluble (the polymer cross-links and hardens) when exposed  to light. Figure 33.9 illustrates the operation of both resist types. Negative resists  have better adhesion to  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  and metal surfaces and good etch resistance. However,  positive resists achieve better resolution, which has made it the more widely used  technique as IC feature sizes have become smaller and smaller.  

Exposure Techniques   The resists are exposed through the mask by one of three  exposure techniques: (a) contact printing, (b) proximity printing, and (c) projection  printing, illustrated in Figure 33.10. In  contact printing , the mask is pressed against  the resist coating during exposure. This results in high resolution of the pattern onto  the wafer surface; an important disadvantage is that physical contact with the wafers  gradually wears out the mask. In  proximity printing , the mask is separated from the  resist coating by a distance of 10 to $25\ \mu\mathrm{m}$  (0.0004–0.001 in). This eliminates mask  wear, but resolution of the image is slightly reduced.  Projection printing  involves  the use of a high-quality lens (or mirror) system to project the image through the

FIGURE 33.10  Optical  lithography exposure  techniques: (a) contact  printing, (b) proximity  printing, and  (c) projection printing.  

mask onto the wafer. This has become the preferred technique because it is non- contact (thus, no mask wear), and the mask pattern can be reduced through optical  projection to obtain high resolution.  

Processing Sequence in Optical lithography  A typical processing sequence  begins with surface of the silicon having just been oxidized to form a thin ﬁ  lm of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   on the wafer. It is desired to remove the  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  ﬁ  lm in certain regions as deﬁ  ned by  the mask pattern. The sequence for a positive resist proceeds as follows, illustrated  in Figure 33.11. (1)  Prepare surface . The wafer is properly cleaned to promote wett- ing and adhesion of the resist. (2)  Apply photoresist . In semiconductor processing,  photoresists are applied by feeding a metered amount of liquid resist onto the center  of the wafer and then spinning the wafer to spread the liquid and achieve a uni- form coating thickness. Desired thickness is around  $1\ \mu\mathrm{m}$  (0.00004 in), which gives  good resolution yet minimizes pinhole defects. (3)  Soft-bake . The purpose of this

pre-exposure bake is to remove solvents, promote adhesion, and harden the resist.  Typical soft-bake temperatures are around $90^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(190^{\mathrm{o}}\mathrm{F})$  for 10 to $20\,\mathrm{{min}}$ . (4)  Align  mask and expose . The pattern mask is aligned relative to the wafer and the resist  is exposed through the mask by one of the methods described above. Alignment  must be accomplished with very high precision, using optical-mechanical equipment  designed speciﬁ  cally for the purpose. If the wafer has been previously processed by  lithography so that a pattern has already been formed in the wafer, then sub  sequent  masks must be accurately registered relative to the existing pattern.

What is etching used for in PCB fabrication?,Answer. Etching is used to remove copper cladding on the PCB surface to define the tracks and lands of the circuit.,"In PCB fabrication, etching is used to remove the unwanted copper cladding from the unprotected areas of a board, leaving behind the desired circuit pattern. This process is essential for creating the electrical interconnections (tracks and lands) that define the circuit. During etching, a chemical etchant is applied to the surface of the board, dissolving the copper in areas that are not covered by a protective resist layer. This subtractive method of circuitization transforms the solid copper film into specific paths for electrical connections, ensuring that only the necessary copper remains on the board.","Etching  removes the copper cladding in the unprotected regions from the board  surface, usually by means of a chemical etchant. Etching is the step that transforms  the solid copper ﬁ  lm into the interconnections for an electrical circuit.  

Etching is done in an etching chamber in which the etchant is sprayed onto the  surface of the board that is now partially coated with resist. Various etchants are  used to remove copper, including ammonium persulfate  $\mathrm{((NH_{4})_{2}S_{2}O_{4})}$ , ammonium  hydroxide  $\mathrm{(NH_{4}O H)}$ , cupric chloride  $\left(\operatorname{CuCl}_{2}\right)$ , and ferric chloride  $\left(\mathrm{{FeCl}}_{3}\right)$ . Each has  its relative advantages and disadvantages. Process parameters (e.g., temperature,  etchant concentration, and duration) must be closely controlled to avoid over- or  under-etching, as in IC fabrication. After etching, the board must be rinsed and the  remaining resist chemically stripped from the surface.  

Plating   In printed circuit boards, plating is needed on the hole surfaces to provide  conductive paths from one side to the other in double-sided boards, or between layers  in multilayer boards. Two types of plating process are used in PCB fabrication: electro- plating and electroless plating (Section 27.3). Electroplating has a higher deposition  rate than electroless plating but requires that the coated surface be metallic (conduc- tive). Electroless plating is slower but does not require a conductive surface.  

After drilling of the via holes and insertion holes, the walls of the holes consist  of epoxy-glass insulation material, which is nonconductive. Accordingly, electroless  plating must be used initially to provide a thin coating of copper on the hole walls.  Once the thin ﬁ  lm of copper has been applied, electrolytic plating is then used to  increase coating thickness on the hole surfaces to between 0.025 and $0.05\,\mathrm{mm}$  (0.001  and 0.002 in).  

Gold is another metal sometimes plated onto printed circuit boards. It is used as  a very thin coating on PCB edge connectors to provide superior electrical contact.  Coating thickness is only about $2.5\;\mu\mathrm{m}$  (0.0001 in).

# 34.2.4  PCB FABRICATION SEQUENCE  

This section describes the processing sequence for various board types. The sequence  is concerned with transforming a copper-clad board of reinforced polymer into a  printed circuit board, a procedure called  circuitization . The desired result is illus- trated in Figure 34.4 for a double-sided board.  

Circuitization   Three methods of circuitization can be used to determine which  regions of the board will be coated with copper [13]: (1) subtractive, (2) additive, and  (3) semiadditive.  

In the  subtractive method , open portions of the copper cladding on the starting  board are etched away from the surface, so that the tracks and lands of the desired  circuit remain. The process is called “subtractive” because copper is removed from  the board surface. The steps in the subtractive method are described in Figure 34.5.  

The  additive method  starts with a board surface that is not copper clad, such  as the uncoated surface of a single-sided board. However, the uncoated surface is  treated with a chemical, called a  buttercoat , which acts as the catalyst for electroless  plating. The steps in the method are outlined in Figure 34.6.

"What is continuity testing, and when is it performed in the PCB fabrication sequence?","Answer. Continuity testing is an electrical test in which contact probes are brought into contact with track and land areas to insure the existence of electrical conduction paths. Continuity tests are generally used: (1) after the bare board has been fabricated, and (2) after the board has been populated with components.","Continuity testing is a process used to verify that electrical connections in a printed circuit board (PCB) are correctly established without any interruptions or shorts. This is done by bringing contact probes into simultaneous contact with track and land areas on the board's surface. The setup consists of an array of probes that are gently pressed to specified points on the board to check electrical connections quickly.

Continuity testing is typically performed after the circuit has been fabricated on the board surface, as part of the testing and finishing operations. It ensures that the PCB functions according to design specifications and contains no quality defects. This testing helps to identify open and short circuits, ensuring the reliability of the completed board before any assembly processes that might involve soldering components onto the board.","The interconnection is accomplished by means of copper-plated via holes that run  from lands on one surface of the board to lands on the opposite surface, as shown  in Figure 34.4. A typical fabrication sequence for a double-sided board (copper- clad on both sides) uses the semiadditive method. After hole drilling, electroless  plating is used to initially plate the holes, followed by electroplating to increase  plating thickness.  

A  multilayer board  is structurally the most complex of the three types, and this  complexity is reﬂ  ected in its manufacturing sequence. The laminated construction can  be seen in Figure 34.8, which highlights some of the features of a multilayer PCB.  The fabrication steps for the individual layers are basically the same as those used  for single- and double-sided boards. What makes multilayer board fabrication more  complicated is that (1) all of the layers, each with its own circuit design, must ﬁ  rst be  processed; then (2) the layers must be joined together to form one integral board; and  ﬁ  nally (3) the assembled board must itself be put through its own processing sequence.  

A multilayer board consists of  logic layers , which carry electrical signals between  components on the board, and  voltage layers , which are used to distribute power.  Logic layers are generally fabricated from double-sided boards, whereas voltage  layers are usually made from single-sided boards. Thinner insulating substrates  are used for multi  layer boards than for their standalone single- and double-sided  counter  parts, so that a suitable thickness of the ﬁ  nal board can be achieved.  

In the second stage, the individual layers are assembled together. The procedure  starts with copper foil on the bottom outside, and then adds the individual layers,  separating one from the next by one or more sheets of glass fabric impregnated with  partially cured epoxy. After all layers have been sandwiched together, a ﬁ  nal copper  foil is placed on the stack to form the top outer layer. Layers are then bonded into a  single board by heating the assembly under pressure to cure the epoxy. After curing,  any excess resin squeezed out of the sandwich around the edges is trimmed away.  

At the start of the third stage of fabrication, the board consists of multiple layers  bonded together, with copper foil cladded on its outer surfaces. Its construction can  therefore be likened to that of a double-sided board; and its processing is likewise  similar. The sequence consists of drilling additional through-holes, plating the holes  to establish conduction paths between the two exterior copper ﬁ  lms as well as cer- tain internal copper layers, and the use of photolithography and etching to form the  circuit pattern on the outer copper surfaces.  

Testing and Finishing Operations  After a circuit has been fabricated on the  board surface, it must be inspected and tested to ensure that it functions according  to design speciﬁ  cations and contains no quality defects. Two procedures are com- mon: (1) visual inspection and (2) continuity testing. In  visual inspection , the board  is examined visually to detect open and short circuits, errors in drilled hole loca- tions, and other faults that can be observed without applying electrical power to the  board. Visual inspections, performed not only after fabrication but also at various  critical stages during production, are accomplished by human eye or machine vision  (Section 40.6.3).  

Continuity testing  involves the use of contact probes brought simultaneously into  contact with track and land areas on the board surface. The setup consists of an array  of probes that are forced under light pressure to make contact with speciﬁ  ed points  on the board surface. Electrical connections between contact points can be quickly  checked in this procedure.  

Several additional processing steps must be performed on the bare board to pre- pare it for assembly. The ﬁ  rst of these ﬁ  nishing operations is the application of a thin  solder layer on the track and land surfaces. This layer serves to protect the copper  from oxidation and contamination. It is carried out either by electroplating or by  bringing the copper side into contact with rotating rollers that are partially sub- mersed in molten solder.  

A second operation involves application of a coating of solder resist to all areas of  the board surface except the lands that are to be subsequently soldered in assembly.

1. **Through-Hole Technology (THT):** 
   - In this method, the components have leads that are inserted into holes drilled into the PCB. 
   - These leads are then soldered to pads on the opposite side of the board. 
   - Through-hole technology provides strong mechanical bonds, making it suitable for components that must withstand mechanical stress. It is traditionally considered more reliable for connections that might experience significant physical stress or high heat.

2. **Surface-Mount Technology (SMT):** 
   - This method involves directly mounting components onto the surface of the board.
   - Components have small metal tabs or ""gull-wing"" leads that are soldered to pads on the surface of the PCB.
   - SMT allows for a higher density of components and is usually more cost-effective for mass production. It supports smaller and lighter electronic assemblies, making it ideal for modern, compact electronics.

Both technologies play critical roles in electronic manufacturing, with THT often used in applications where durability is prioritized and SMT employed for efficiency and compactness.","Upper PCB  assembly is through- hole technology  (pin-in-hole) whereas  lower assembly is  mostly surface-mount  technology.

As track  widths became ﬁ  ner and ﬁ  ner, photolithography was  substituted for screen printing.  

Initial techniques to design the circuit masks involved  a manual inking procedure, in which the designer at- tempted to route the conducting tracks to provide the  required connections and avoid short circuits on a large  sheet of paper or vellum. This became more difﬁ  cult as  the number of components on the board increased and  the conducting lines interconnecting the components  became ﬁ  ner. Computer programs were developed to  aid the designer in solving the routing problem. How- ever, in many cases, it was impossible to ﬁ  nd a solu- tion with no intersecting tracks (short circuits). To solve  the problem, jumper wires were hand-soldered to the  board to make these connections.

What are some of the reasons and defects that make rework an integral step in the PCB fabrication sequence?,"Answer. Rework is required to correct the following types of defects: (1) replace defective components, (2) insert missing components, (3) repair faulty solder joints, and (4) repair of copper film that has lifted from the substrate surface.","In the PCB fabrication sequence, rework is an integral step due to several reasons and potential defects:

1. **Defective Solder Joints**: Surface Mount Technology (SMT) often results in smaller and more densely packed solder joints compared to through-hole technology. The smaller size can lead to issues like cold solder joints, insufficient solder, or excess solder forming bridges between pads, causing short circuits.

2. **Component Misalignment**: During the soldering process, surface-mount components are primarily held in place by solder paste or adhesive, which may not securely fix them at high temperatures. This can lead to components shifting and becoming misaligned, ultimately affecting circuit functionality.

3. **Missing or Damaged Components**: During assembly, components might get damaged or missed entirely. Environmental factors, handling errors, or equipment malfunctions can contribute to these issues, necessitating rework to replace or add the missing components.

4. **Board Substrate Damage**: The PCB substrate can suffer from scratches, burns, or delamination during assembly processes, which could affect the performance and reliability of the board.

5. **Copper Film Issues**: Lifting or peeling copper film can result in connectivity issues. Repairing or replacing these films is essential to maintain circuit integrity.

6. **Design and Layout Challenges**: SMT involves densely packed components, leaving minimal space for additional test points or rework. Errors in design or unexpected defects in functionality often require rework for correction.

Rework involves manual intervention using tools like small-bit soldering irons and magnifying devices to correct these issues. This process allows the manufacturer to salvage and repair faulty boards, minimizing waste and reducing costs associated with scrapping defective units, thus making rework a crucial part of the PCB assembly process.","Inspection  After cleaning, the PCB assembly is inspected for defective solder  joints. Inspection of soldering quality is somewhat more difﬁ  cult for surface-mount  circuits (SMCs) because these assemblies are generally more densely packed, the  solder joints are smaller, and joint geometries are different from those in through- hole assemblies. One of the problems is the way surface mount components are held  in place during soldering. In through-hole assembly, the components are mechani- cally fastened in place by clinched leads. In SMT assembly, components are held by  solder paste or adhesive. At soldering temperatures this method of attachment is not  as secure, and components sometimes shift. Another problem with the smaller sizes  in SMT is a greater likelihood of solder bridges forming between adjacent leads,  resulting in short circuits.  

Visual inspection is used to detect for board substrate damage, missing or damaged  components, soldering faults, and similar quality defects that can be observed by eye.  Machine vision systems are being used to perform these inspections automatically in  a growing number of installations.  

Testing  Test procedures must be performed on the completed assembly to verify  its functionality. The board design must allow for this testing by including test points  in the circuit layout. These test points are convenient locations in the circuit where  probes can make contact for testing. Individual components in the circuit are tested  by contacting the component leads, applying input test signals, and measuring the  output signals. More sophisticated procedures include digital function tests, in which  the entire circuit or major subcircuits are tested using a programmed sequence of  input signals and measuring the corresponding output signals to simulate operating  conditions.  

Another test used for printed circuit board assemblies is the substitution test,  in which a production unit is plugged into a mock-up of the working system and  energized to perform its functions. If the assembly performs in a satisfactory way, it  is deemed as passing the test. It is then unplugged, and the next production unit is  substituted in the mock-up.  

Finally, a burn-in test is performed on certain types of PCB assemblies that may  be subject to “infant mortality.” Some boards contain defects that are not revealed in  normal functional tests but which are likely to cause failure of the circuit during early  service. Burn-in tests operate the assemblies under power for a certain period of time,  such as 24 or 72 hours, sometimes at elevated temperatures, such as $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(100^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ , to  force these defects to manifest their failures during the testing period. Boards not  subject to infant mortality will survive this test and provide long service life.  

The smaller scale of SMT poses problems in circuit testing because less space is  available around each component. Contact probes must be physically smaller and  more probes are required because SMT assemblies are more densely populated.  One way of dealing with this issue is to design the circuit layout with extra lands  whose only purpose is to provide a test probe contact site. Unfortunately, including  these test lands runs counter to the goal of achieving higher packing densities on the  SMT board.  

Rework  When inspection and testing indicate that one or more components on  the board are defective, or certain solder joints are faulty, it usually makes sense  to try to repair the assembly rather than discard it together with all of the other  components that are not defective. This repair step is an integral part of electronic  assembly plant operations. Common rework tasks include touchup (repair of solder  faults), replacement of defective or missing components, and repair of copper ﬁ  lm  that has lifted from the substrate surface. These tasks are manual operations, requir- ing skilled workers using soldering irons. Rework of surface-mount assemblies is  more difﬁ  cult than in conventional PIH assemblies, again because of the smaller  component sizes. Special tools are required, such as small-bit soldering irons, magni- fying devices, and instruments for grasping and manipulating the small parts.  

#  Electrical Connector Technology  

PCB assemblies must be connected to back planes, and into racks and cabinets, and  these cabinets must be connected to other cabinets and systems by means of cables.  The growing use of electronics in so many types of products has made electrical  connections an important technology. The performance of any electronic system  depends on the reliability of the individual connections linking the components of  the system together. This section is concerned with connector technology that is  usually applied at the third and higher levels of electronics packaging.

Identify some of the advantages of surface mount technology over conventional through-hole technology.,"Answer. Advantages of SMT include: (1) smaller components, (2) higher packing densities, (3) components can be mounted on both sides of the board, (4) smaller PCBs are possible for the same function, (5) reduced number of holes drilled in the board, and (6) certain undesirable electrical effects are reduced, such as spurious surface capacitances and inductances.","Surface mount technology (SMT) offers several advantages over conventional through-hole technology:

1. **Increased Component Density:**
   - SMT allows components to be mounted on both sides of the printed circuit board (PCB), effectively doubling the component density.
   - The reduced size of SMT components enables more components to be packed into the same area, further increasing circuit densities.

2. **Smaller and Lighter Assemblies:**
   - SMT components are generally smaller and lighter than through-hole components, leading to more compact and lighter electronic assemblies.
   - This miniaturization is crucial for modern electronics, allowing for more portable and efficient devices.

3. **Reduced Production Costs:**
   - SMT supports automated assembly processes, reducing the need for manual soldering and handling, which can lower labor costs and improve production rates.
   - The technology facilitates faster assembly line speeds and increased throughput.

4. **Improved Electrical Performance:**
   - Shorter lead lengths in SMT reduce parasitic inductance and capacitance, potentially improving high-frequency performance.
   - This can be beneficial in achieving better signal integrity and faster signal transmission.

5. **Enhanced Reliability:**
   - Having no leads protruding through the board reduces the chances of mechanical damage.
   - Lower mechanical stress on solder joints as components are soldered directly onto board pads, reducing the likelihood of joint failure due to thermal expansion.

These advantages make SMT a preferred choice for many applications, despite some of its challenges with manual handling and inspection.","# Historical Note 34.2  Surface-mount technology

However, there are several limitations and disadvantages associated with SMT:

1. **Handling and Assembly Challenges**: 
   - SMT components are often much smaller than those used in through-hole technology, making them more difficult to handle and place accurately by hand. This necessitates more sophisticated and sometimes costly automated assembly processes.

2. **Inspection and Rework Difficulties**: 
   - The smaller size of SMT components makes it more challenging to inspect, test, and rework the assemblies. Specialized equipment and techniques are required to ensure quality and to repair any defects.

3. **Component Availability**: 
   - Not all electronic components are available in surface-mount configurations. Some larger or specific components may only be available in through-hole form, necessitating mixed-technology assemblies.

4. **Thermal and Mechanical Stress**:
   - Surface-mounted components can be more susceptible to mechanical stress and may have less tolerance for thermal cycling compared to through-hole components. This can affect the reliability of the solder joints, especially in environments with significant temperature changes or mechanical vibrations.

5. **Design Complexity**:
   - The design and layout of SMT boards can be more complex, requiring precise planning to accommodate densely packed components and the need for effective heat dissipation.

Overall, while SMT allows for innovative and compact electronic designs, its adoption involves addressing these challenges to maintain manufacturing efficiency and product reliability.","# Historical Note 34.2  Surface-mount technology

1. **Solder Paste and Reflow Soldering:**
   - **Process:** In this method, a solder paste is applied to the designated land areas on the PCB. Components are then placed onto the board. The assembly is heated to cause the solder paste to melt and create a permanent solder joint upon cooling. 
   - **Functionality:** The solder paste acts as the solder, the flux, and the adhesive, which temporarily holds the components in place until the reflow process is complete.
   - **Suitable Components:** This method is ideal for components that can withstand the thermal profile of the reflow oven.

2. **Adhesive Bonding and Wave Soldering:**
   - **Process:** Components are first attached to the PCB using adhesives. The assembly is then passed through a wave soldering machine, where solder is applied.

What is a solder paste?,Answer. A solder paste is a suspension of solder powders in a flux binder. The flux binder includes an adhesive that attaches the SMT components to the board surface. The solder constitutes about 85% of the total volume of the paste.,"A solder paste is a material used in surface mount technology (SMT) for attaching components to the surface of a circuit board. It is a mixture or suspension of solder powders within a flux binder. Solder paste serves three primary functions:

1. **Solder**: The solder particles typically make up 80% to 90% of the total paste volume. When heated during the reflow soldering process, the solder particles melt to create a mechanical and electrical connection between the component leads and the circuit board.

2. **Flux**: The flux in the solder paste facilitates the soldering process by removing oxides from the soldering surfaces, improving the wetting properties and ensuring a better bond between the solder and the components.

3. **Adhesive**: The paste temporarily holds the components in place before soldering, allowing for precise positioning on the board.

The application of solder paste on circuit boards can be achieved through screen printing or syringe dispensing, and it must have properties that allow it to maintain its shape without spreading beyond desired areas.","It turns out that certain types of SMT compo- nents are more suited to one method whereas other types are more suited to the  other method.

Methods of applying the solder paste to the board surface  include screen printing and syringe dispensing. Properties of the paste must be com- patible with these application methods; the paste must ﬂ  ow yet not be so liquid that  it spreads beyond the localized area where it is applied.  

After solder paste application, the components are placed onto the board surface  by automated placement machines or semiautomatic placement machines. The auto- matic machines operate under computer numerical control (Section 37.3). Compo- nents (e.g., chip carriers, capacitors, resistors) to be placed are usually supplied in  magazines or attached to tape in reels that can be loaded into feeders on the auto- mated machines. The starting blank PCB is moved and positioned under the pick- and-place work head that places the components at speciﬁ  ed locations on the board  using a high-speed  $x$ - y  positioning system. The work head uses suction nozzles to  retrieve and handle components. Automated machines operate at cycle rates of up  to 30,000 components per hour [20]. For mass production, they are frequently inte- grated into production lines, so that most or all of the processes performed on the  board during assembly are completed in one automated sequence.  

The semiautomatic machines assist a worker in the placement operation using a  high-resolution vision system. Components to be placed are presented to the opera- tor in the correct placement sequence by a turret mechanism, and then the operator  picks the component and is guided by the vision monitor to place it at the target

2. **Pressure Connections**: This method uses mechanical force to establish electrical continuity between components. Pressure connections can be further divided into permanent and separable types. Permanent connections involve methods like crimping, where the terminal barrel is mechanically deformed around a wire. Press fit technology, another form, uses interference fitting to connect terminal pins into plated holes in PCBs, ensuring electrical contact through mechanical deformation or spring-loading of the pins.","These tasks are manual operations, requir- ing skilled workers using soldering irons. Rework of surface-mount assemblies is  more difﬁ  cult than in conventional PIH assemblies, again because of the smaller  component sizes. Special tools are required, such as small-bit soldering irons, magni- fying devices, and instruments for grasping and manipulating the small parts.  

#  Electrical Connector Technology  

PCB assemblies must be connected to back planes, and into racks and cabinets, and  these cabinets must be connected to other cabinets and systems by means of cables.  The growing use of electronics in so many types of products has made electrical  connections an important technology. The performance of any electronic system  depends on the reliability of the individual connections linking the components of  the system together. This section is concerned with connector technology that is  usually applied at the third and higher levels of electronics packaging.  

To begin, there are two basic methods of making electrical connections: (1) solder- ing and (2) pressure connections. Soldering was discussed in Section 30.2 and through- out the current chapter. It is the most widely used technology in electronics.  Pressure  connections  are electrical connections in which mechanical forces are used to estab- lish electrical continuity between components. They can be divided into two types:  permanent and separable.  

# 34.4.1  PERMANENT CONNECTIONS  

A permanent connection involves high-pressure contact between two metal sur- faces, in which one or both parts are mechanically deformed during the assembly  process. Permanent connection methods include crimping, press ﬁ  t technology, and  insulation displacement.  

Crimping of Connector Terminals  This connection method is used to assemble  wire to electrical terminals. Although assembly of the wire to the terminal forms a  permanent joint, the terminal itself is designed to be connected and disconnected  to its mating component. There are a variety of terminal styles, some of which are  shown in Figure 34.14, and they are available in various sizes. They all must be con- nected to conductor wire, and crimping is the operation for doing this.  Crimping involves the mechanical deformation of the terminal barrel to form a permanent  connection with the stripped end of a wire inserted into it. The crimping operation  squeezes and closes the barrel around the bare wire. Crimping is performed by hand  tools or crimping machines. The terminals are supplied either as individual pieces or  on long strips that can be fed into a crimping machine. Properly accomplished, the  crimped joint will have low electrical resistance and high mechanical strength.

Define crimping in the context of electrical connections?,Answer. Crimping involves the mechanical forming of a terminal barrel to form a permanent connection with the stripped end of a conductor wire.,"Crimping in the context of electrical connections refers to the process of mechanically deforming a metal terminal barrel to form a permanent connection with the stripped end of a wire. This is achieved by squeezing and closing the terminal barrel around the bare wire. The crimped joint provides a low electrical resistance pathway and ensures high mechanical strength. Crimping can be performed using hand tools or crimping machines, and is a widely used technique for making reliable, permanent joints in electrical assemblies. The terminals can be designed in various styles, such as slotted tongue, ring tongue, or flanged spade, to fit different application needs.","These tasks are manual operations, requir- ing skilled workers using soldering irons.

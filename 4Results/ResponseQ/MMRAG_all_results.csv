We have classified glass as a ceramic material; yet glass is different from the traditional and new ceramics. What is the difference?,"Answer. Glass is vitreous - it is in the glassy state, whereas traditional and new ceramics are, by and large, polycrystalline materials.","Glass is classified as a ceramic because it is an inorganic, non-metallic material. However, it differs significantly from traditional and new ceramics due to its structure and processing.

1. **Structure**: 
   - **Glass** typically has an amorphous structure, meaning its atoms are not arranged in a regular, repeating pattern. This lack of crystallinity differentiates it from traditional ceramics, which are generally crystalline.
   - **Traditional and New Ceramics** have a crystalline structure with defined patterns, contributing to their distinct physical properties.

2. **Processing**:
   - **Glass** is formed by melting and cooling processes that do not involve crystallization. This process allows glass to be shaped easily into various forms.
   - **Traditional Ceramics** involve shaping powders and then firing them at high temperatures to obtain a solid form. This includes processes like pressing and sintering.
   
3. **Properties**:
   - Due to its amorphous structure, glass is usually more transparent than crystalline ceramics and can be used in applications requiring optical clarity.
   - Traditional ceramics tend to be more opaque and are valued for their hardness, high melting points, and electrical insulation properties.

In summary, while glass shares the inorganic and non-metallic nature of ceramics, it is distinguished by its amorphous structure, unique processing methods, and varied optical properties.","Another glass fiber material is S- glass, which has higher strength but is not as economical as E-glass. Compositions are  indicated in the table.  

Insulating fiberglass wool can be manufactured from regular soda-lime-silica  glasses. The glass product for fiber optics consists of a long, continuous core of glass  with high refractive index surrounded by a sheath of lower refractive glass. The in-  side glass must have a very high transmittance for light in order to accomplish long  distance communication.  

Optical Glasses  Applications for these glasses include lenses for eyeglasses and  optical instruments such as cameras, microscopes, and telescopes. To achieve their  function, the glasses must have different refractive indices, but each lens must be  homogenous in composition. Optical glasses are generally divided into: crowns and  flints.  Crown glass  has a low index of refraction, while  flint glass  contains lead oxide  (PbO) that gives it a high index of refraction.  

# 7.4.3  GLASS- CERAMICS  

Glass-ceramics are a class of ceramic material produced by conversion of glass into   a  polycrystalline structure through heat treatment. The proportion of crystalline phase  in the final product typically ranges between $90\%$  and $98\%$ , with the remain- der being  unconverted vitreous material. Grain size is usually between 0.1 and  $1.0\ m\mathrm{m}$  (4 and 40  $m$ -in), significantly smaller than the grain size of conventional ceramics. This fine  crystal microstructure makes glass-ceramics much stronger than the glasses from  which they are derived. Also, due to their crystal structure, glass-ceramics are opaque  (usually gray or white) rather than clear.  

The processing sequence for glass-ceramics is as follows: (1) The first step in-  volves heating and forming operations used in glassworking (Section 12.2) to create  the desired product geometry. Glass shaping methods are generally more economi- cal  than pressing and sintering to shape traditional and new ceramics made from powders.  (2) The product is cooled. (3) The glass is reheated to a temperature suf- ficient to cause  a dense network of crystal nuclei to form throughout the material. It is the high density  of nucleation sites that inhibits grain growth of individual crystals, thus leading  ultimately to the fine grain size in the glass-ceramic material. The key to the propensity  for nucleation is the presence of small amounts of nucleating agents in the glass  composition. Common nucleating agents are  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ ,  $\mathrm{P}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{5}$ , and  $\mathrm{ZrO}_{2}$ . (4) Once  nucleation is initiated, the heat treatment is continued at a higher temperature to cause  growth of the crystalline phases.  

Several examples of glass-ceramic systems and typical compositions are listed  in Table 7.5. The  $\mathrm{Li}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{-}\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\mathrm{-}\mathrm{SiO}$ 2  system is the most important commercially; it  includes Corning Ware (Pyroceram), the familiar product of the Corning Glass Works.

The significant advantages of glass-ceramics include (1) efficiency of processing  in the glassy state, (2) close dimensional control over the final product shape, and (3)  good  mechanical and physical properties. Properties include high strength (stronger than  glass), absence of porosity, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and high re-  sistance to thermal shock. These properties have resulted in applications in cooking  ware, heat exchangers, and missile radomes. Certain systems (e.g.,  $\mathrm{MgO-Al_{2}O_{3}-S i O}$ 2 system) are also characterized by high electrical resistance, suitable for electrical  and electronics applications.

# Some   Important   Elements   Related   to   Ceramics  

In this section, several elements of engineering importance are discussed: carbon,  silicon, and boron. These materials are encountered occasionally in subsequent  chapters. Although they are not ceramic materials according to the definition, they  sometimes compete for applications with ceramics. And they have important appli-  cations of their own. Basic data on these elements are presented in Table 7.6.  

# 7.5.1  CARBON  

Carbon occurs in two alternative forms of engineering and commercial impor-  tance: graphite and diamond. They compete with ceramics in various applications:  graphite  in situations where its refractory properties are important, and diamond

in industrial applications where hardness is the critical factor (such as cutting and  grinding tools).  

Graphite  Graphite has a high content of crystalline carbon in the form of layers.  Bonding between atoms in the layers is covalent and therefore strong, but the par-  allel layers are bonded to each other by weak van der Waals forces. This structure  makes graphite quite anisotropic; strength and other properties vary significantly  with direction. It explains why graphite can be used both as a lubricant and as a fiber  in advanced composite materials. In powder form, graphite possesses low frictional  characteristics due to the ease with which it shears between the layers; in this form,  graphite is valued as a lubricant. In fiber form, graphite is oriented in the hexagonal  planar direction to produce a filament material of very high strength and elastic  modulus. These graphite fibers are used in structural composites ranging from tennis  rackets to fighter aircraft components.  

Graphite exhibits certain high temperature properties that are both useful and  unusual. It is resistant to thermal shock, and its strength actually increases with tem-  perature. Tensile strength at room temperature is about  $100\;\mathrm{MPa}$   $\{15{,}000\ 1{\tt b}/\mathrm{in}^{2}\}$ ), but  increases to about twice this value at $2500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(4500^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  [5].  Theoretical density of carbon  is $2.22~\mathrm{gm}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , but apparent density of bulk graphite is lower due to porosity (around  $1.7\;\mathrm{{gm}/\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}}$ ).  This is increased through compacting and heating. It is electrically conduc-  tive, but its conductivity is not as high as most metals.  A disadvantage of graphite is that  it oxidizes in air above around $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(900^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ). In a reducing atmosphere it can be used  up to around $3000^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(5400^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ), not far below its sublimation point of $3727^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(6740^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  

The traditional form of graphite is polycrystalline with a certain amount of amor-  phous carbon in the mixture. # Ceramics

Metals are usually thought to be the most important  class of engineering materials. However, it is of interest  to note that ceramic materials are actually more abun-  dant and widely used. Included in this category are clay  products (e.g., bricks and pottery), glass, cement, and  more modern ceramic materials such as tungsten car-  bide and cubic boron nitride. This is the class of materi-  als discussed in this chapter. Several elements related to  ceramics are also covered because they are sometimes  used in similar applications. These elements are carbon,  silicon, and boron.  

The importance of ceramics as engineering materi- als  derives from their abundance in nature and their  mechanical and physical properties, which are quite  different from those of metals. A  ceramic  material is  an inorganic compound consisting of a metal (or semi-  metal) and one or more nonmetals. The word  ceramic  traces from the Greek  keramos  meaning potter’s clay  or wares made from fired clay. Important examples of  ceramic materials are  silica , or silicon dioxide  $(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ , the  main ingredient in most glass products;  alumina , or  aluminum oxide  $\left(\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$ , used in applications rang- ing  from abrasives to artificial bones; and more com- plex  compounds  such  as  hydrous  aluminum  silicate  $(\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{Si}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{5}(\mathrm{OH})_{4})$ ), known as  kaolinite , the principal in-  gredient in most clay products. The elements in these  compounds are the most common in Earth’s crust; see  Table 7.1. The group includes many additional com-  pounds, some of which occur naturally while others are  manufactured.  

The general properties that make ceramics useful in  engineered products are high hardness, good electrical  and thermal insulating characteristics, chemical stabil-  ity, and high melting temperatures. Some ceramics are  translucent—window glass being the clearest example.  They are also brittle and possess virtually no ductility,  which can cause problems in both processing and per-  formance of ceramic products.

The commercial and technological importance of ceramics is best demonstrated  by the variety of products and applications that are based on this class of material.

What is the predominant chemical compound in almost all glass products?,Answer. Silica - SiO2.,"The predominant chemical compound in almost all glass products is silica (SiO₂). It typically comprises 50% to 75% of the total chemistry in glass compositions. Silica is favored for its ability to easily form a glassy state upon cooling from liquid, unlike most ceramics which tend to crystallize.","Other simple tools  rigidity had been attained in the product, a cup-shaped were utilized to add the stem and/or base to the object.  vessel.

# 7.4.1 CHEMISTRY AND PROPERTIES OF GLASS  

The principal ingredient in virtually all glasses is  silica  $(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ ), most commonly found  as the mineral quartz in sandstone and silica sand. Quartz occurs naturally as a crys-  talline substance; but when melted and then cooled, it forms vitreous silica. Silica glass  has a very low thermal expansion coefficient and is therefore quite resistant to  thermal shock. These properties are ideal for elevated temperature applications;  accordingly, Pyrex and chemical glassware designed for heating are made with high  proportions of silica glass.  

In order to reduce the melting point of glass for easier processing, and to con-  trol properties, the composition of most commercial glasses includes other oxides  as well as silica. Silica remains as the main component in these glass products, usu-  ally comprising  $50\%$  to  $75\%$  of total chemistry. The reason  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  is used so widely  in these compositions is because it is the best  glass former . It naturally transforms into  a glassy state upon cooling from the liquid, whereas most ceramics crystallize upon  solidification. Table 7.4 lists typical chemistries for some common glasses. The  additional ingredients are contained in a solid solution with  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ , and each has a  function: (1) acting as flux (promoting fusion) during heating; (2) increasing fluidity  in the molten glass for processing; (3) retarding  devitrification —the tendency to  crystallize from the glassy state; (4) reducing thermal expansion in the final product;   (5) improving the chemical resistance against attack by acids, basic substances, or  water; (6) adding color to the glass; and (7) altering the index of refraction for opti-  cal applications (e.g., lenses).  

# 7.4.2  GLASS  PRODUCTS  

Following is a list of the major categories of glass products. The roles played by the  different ingredients are examined in Table 7.4 as these products are discussed.  

Window Glass  This glass is represented by two chemistries in Table 7.4: (1) soda-  lime glass and (2) window glass. The soda-lime formula dates back to the glass-blow-  ing industry of the 1800s and earlier. It was (and is) made by mixing soda  $\mathrm{(Na_{2}O)}$  and  lime (CaO) with silica $\left(\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\right)$  as the major ingredient. The blending of ingredients has  evolved empirically to achieve a balance between avoiding crystallization during

cooling and achieving chemical durability of the final product. Modern window glass  and the techniques for making it have required slight adjustments in composition  and closer control over its variation. Magnesia  $\mathrm{(MgO)}$ ) has been added to help re- duce  devitrification.  

Containers  In previous times, the same basic soda-lime composition was used for  manual glass-blowing to make bottles and other containers. Modern processes for  shaping glass containers cool the glass more rapidly than older methods. Also, the  importance of chemical stability in container glass is better understood today. Re-  sulting changes in composition have attempted to optimize the proportions of lime  (CaO) and soda  $\left(\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$ . Lime promotes fluidity. It also increases devitrification,  but since cooling is more rapid, this effect is not as important as in prior processing  techniques with slower cooling rates. Soda reduces chemical instability and solubil- ity  of the container glass.  

Light Bulb Glass   Glass used in light bulbs and other thin glass items (e.g., drinking  glasses, Christmas ornaments) is high in soda and low in lime; it also contains small  amounts of magnesia and alumina. The chemistry is dictated largely by the econom-  ics of large volumes involved in light bulb manufacture. The raw materials are inex-  pensive and suited to the continuous melting furnaces used today.  

Laboratory Glassware  These products include containers for chemicals (e.g.,  flasks, beakers, glass tubing). The glass must be resistant to chemical attack and ther-  mal shock. Glass that is high in silica is suitable because of its low thermal expan-  sion. The trade name “Vicor” is used for this high-silica glass. This product is very  insoluble in water and acids. Additions of boric oxide also produce a glass with low  coefficient of thermal expansion, so some glass for laboratory ware contains  $\mathrm{B}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$  in  amounts of around  $13\%$ . The trade name “Pyrex” is used for the borosilicate glass   developed by the Corning Glass Works. Both Vicor and Pyrex are included in the  listing as examples of this product category.  

Glass Fibers  Glass fibers are manufactured for a number of important applica- tions,  including fiberglass reinforced plastics, insulation wool, and fiber optics. The  compositions vary according to function. The most commonly used glass reinforcing  fibers in plastics are E-glass. It is high in CaO and ${\mathrm{Al}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$  content, it is economical, and  it possesses good tensile strength in fiber form. Another glass fiber material is S- glass, which has higher strength but is not as economical as E-glass. Compositions are  indicated in the table.  

Insulating fiberglass wool can be manufactured from regular soda-lime-silica  glasses. The glass product for fiber optics consists of a long, continuous core of glass  with high refractive index surrounded by a sheath of lower refractive glass. The in-  side glass must have a very high transmittance for light in order to accomplish long  distance communication.  

Optical Glasses  Applications for these glasses include lenses for eyeglasses and  optical instruments such as cameras, microscopes, and telescopes. To achieve their  function, the glasses must have different refractive indices, but each lens must be  homogenous in composition. Optical glasses are generally divided into: crowns and  flints.

What are the three basic steps in the glassworking sequence?,"Answer. (1) raw materials preparation and melting, (2) shaping, and (3) heat treatment. Finishing operations (e.g., grinding, polishing, etching) are performed on some glass products, if needed.","The three basic steps in the glassworking sequence are:

1. **Preparation of Raw Materials and Melting**: In this initial step, raw materials—primarily silica from sand—are cleaned, sorted by size, and mixed with other components like soda ash and limestone. This mixture, often including recycled glass to aid melting, is loaded into different types of furnaces (pot, day tank, continuous tank, or electric) to be melted at high temperatures (around 1500–1600°C) into a clear molten glass ready for shaping.

2. **Shaping**: The molten glass is formed into the desired product shape through various processes. These include:
   - **Casting**: Pouring the fluid glass into molds, used for large objects like lenses.
   - **Pressing**: Using a plunger to shape the glass in a mold, suitable for flat items such as dishes.
   - **Blowing**: Creating hollow shapes by inflating the glass in a mold. This is accomplished by press-and-blow or blow-and-blow methods, commonly used for bottles and jars.
   - **Spinning**: Centrifugal force used to shape funnel-like components from a molten gob of glass.

3. **Heat Treatment and Finishing**: After shaping, the glass undergoes heat treatment to relieve stresses. This step might involve processes like annealing, which gradually cools the glass to prevent brittleness and cracking. Finishing operations, such as polishing, grinding, or coating, are performed to enhance the product's appearance and usability or to meet specific functional requirements. 

Each step is crucial to ensure the final product is of high quality and meets the intended design specifications.","# Glassworking

12.4 Product Design Considerations  

Glass products are commercially manufactured in an  almost unlimited variety of shapes. Many are produced  in very large quantities, such as light bulbs, beverage  bottles, and window glass. Others, such as giant tele- scope lenses, are made individually.  

Glass is one of three basic types of ceramics (Chap- ter 7). It is distinguished by its noncrystalline (vitreous)  structure, whereas the other ceramic materials have  a crystalline structure. The methods by which glass is  shaped into useful products are quite different from  those used for the other types. In glassworking, the  principal starting material is silica  $(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ ; this is usually  combined with other oxide ceramics that form glasses.  The starting material is heated to transform it from a  hard solid into a viscous liquid; it is then shaped into  the desired geometry while in this highly plastic or ﬂ  uid  condition. When cooled and hard, the material remains  in the glassy state rather than crystallizing.  

The typical manufacturing sequence in glassworking  consists of the steps pictured in Figure 12.1. Shaping is  accomplished by various processes, including casting,  pressing-and-blowing (to produce bottles and other  containers), and rolling (to make plate glass). A ﬁ  nish- ing step is required for certain products.

# Raw Materials  Preparation and  Melting  

The main component in nearly all glasses is silica, the  primary source of which is natural quartz in sand. The  sand must be washed and classiﬁ  ed. Washing removes  impurities such as clay and certain minerals that would  cause undesirable coloring of the glass.  Classifying  the  sand means grouping the grains according to size. The  most desirable particle size for glassmaking is in the  range of 0.1 to $0.6\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.004–0.025 in) [3].

(source of  $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ ), and other minerals are added in the proper proportions to achieve  the desired composition. The mixing is usually done in batches, in amounts that are  compatible with the capacities of available melting furnaces.  

Recycled glass is usually added to the mixture in modern practice. In addition  to preserving the environment, recycled glass facilitates melting. Depending on the  amount of waste glass available and the speciﬁ  cations of the ﬁ  nal composition, the  proportion of recycled glass may be up to $100\%$ .  

The batch of starting materials to be melted is referred to as a  charge , and the pro- cedure of loading it into the melting furnace is called  charging  the furnace. Glass- melting furnaces can be divided into the following types [3]: (1)  pot furnaces —  ceramic pots of limited capacity in which melting occurs by heating the walls of the  pot; (2)  day tanks —larger capacity vessels for batch production in which heating is  done by burning fuels above the charge; (3)  continuous tank furnaces —long tank  furnaces in which raw materials are fed in one end, and melted as they move to the  other end where molten glass is drawn out for high production; and (4)  electric fur- naces  of various designs for a wide range of production rates. A gob of molten glass is dropped into  a conical mold made of steel. The mold is rotated so that centrifugal force causes  the glass to ﬂ  ow upward and spread itself on the mold surface. The faceplate (i.e.,  the front viewing screen) is later assembled to the funnel using a sealing glass of low  melting point.  

Pressing  This is a widely used process for mass producing glass pieces such as dishes,  bake ware, headlight lenses, TV tube faceplates, and similar items that are relatively  ﬂ  at. The process is illustrated and described in Figure 12.3. The large quantities of most  pressed products justify a high level of automation in this production sequence.  

Blowing  Several shaping sequences include blowing as one or more of the steps.  Instead of a manual operation, blowing is performed on highly automated equip- ment. The two sequences described here are the press-and-blow and blow-and-blow  methods.  

As the name indicates, the  press-and-blow  method is a pressing operation fol- lowed by a blowing operation, as portrayed in Figure 12.4. The process is suited to

the production of wide-mouth containers. A split mold is used in the blowing opera- tion for part removal. The  blow-and-blow  method is used to produce smaller-mouthed bottles. The se- quence is similar to the preceding, except that two (or more) blowing operations are  used rather than pressing and blowing. There are variations to the process, depend- ing on the geometry of the product, with one possible sequence shown in Figure 12.5.

Reheating is sometimes required between blowing steps. Duplicate and triplicate  molds are sometimes used along with matching gob feeders to increase production  rates. Press-and-blow and blow-and-blow methods are used to make jars, beverage  bottles, incandescent light bulb enclosures, and similar geometries.  

Casting  If the molten glass is sufﬁ  ciently ﬂ  uid, it can be poured into a mold. Rela- tively massive objects, such as astronomical lenses and mirrors, are made by this  method. These pieces must be cooled very slowly to avoid internal stresses and pos- sible cracking owing to temperature gradients that would otherwise be set up in  the glass. After cooling and solidifying, the piece must be ﬁ  nished by lapping and  polishing. Casting is not much used in glassworking except for these kinds of special  jobs. The batch of starting materials to be melted is referred to as a  charge , and the pro- cedure of loading it into the melting furnace is called  charging  the furnace. Glass- melting furnaces can be divided into the following types [3]: (1)  pot furnaces —  ceramic pots of limited capacity in which melting occurs by heating the walls of the  pot; (2)  day tanks —larger capacity vessels for batch production in which heating is  done by burning fuels above the charge; (3)  continuous tank furnaces —long tank  furnaces in which raw materials are fed in one end, and melted as they move to the  other end where molten glass is drawn out for high production; and (4)  electric fur- naces  of various designs for a wide range of production rates.  

Glass melting is generally carried out at temperatures around  $1500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to  $1600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ $(2700^{\circ}\mathrm{F}{-}2900^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ). The melting cycle for a typical charge takes 24 to 48 hours. This  is the time required for all of the sand grains to become a clear liquid and for the  molten glass to be reﬁ  ned and cooled to the appropriate temperature for working.  Molten glass is a viscous liquid, the viscosity being inversely related to temperature.  Because the shaping operation immediately follows the melting cycle, the tempera- ture at which the glass is tapped from the furnace depends on the viscosity required  for the subsequent process.  

#  Shaping Processes in Glassworking  

The major categories of glass products were identiﬁ  ed in Section 7.4.2 as window  glass, containers, light bulbs, laboratory glassware, glass ﬁ  bers, and optical glass. De- spite the variety represented by this list, the shaping processes to fabricate these  products can be grouped into only three categories: (1) discrete processes for piece  ware, which includes bottles, light bulbs, and other individual items; (2) continuous  processes for making ﬂ  at glass (sheet and plate glass for windows) and tubing (for  laboratory ware and ﬂ  uorescent lights); and (3) ﬁ  ber-making processes to produce  ﬁ  bers for insulation, ﬁ  berglass composite materials, and ﬁ  ber optics.

12.4 Product Design Considerations  

Glass products are commercially manufactured in an  almost unlimited variety of shapes. Many are produced  in very large quantities, such as light bulbs, beverage  bottles, and window glass. Others, such as giant tele- scope lenses, are made individually.  

Glass is one of three basic types of ceramics (Chap- ter 7). It is distinguished by its noncrystalline (vitreous)  structure, whereas the other ceramic materials have  a crystalline structure. The methods by which glass is  shaped into useful products are quite different from  those used for the other types. In glassworking, the  principal starting material is silica  $(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ ; this is usually  combined with other oxide ceramics that form glasses.  The starting material is heated to transform it from a  hard solid into a viscous liquid; it is then shaped into  the desired geometry while in this highly plastic or ﬂ  uid  condition. When cooled and hard, the material remains  in the glassy state rather than crystallizing.  

The typical manufacturing sequence in glassworking  consists of the steps pictured in Figure 12.1. Shaping is  accomplished by various processes, including casting,  pressing-and-blowing (to produce bottles and other  containers), and rolling (to make plate glass). A ﬁ  nish- ing step is required for certain products.

# Raw Materials  Preparation and  Melting  

The main component in nearly all glasses is silica, the  primary source of which is natural quartz in sand. The  sand must be washed and classiﬁ  ed. Washing removes  impurities such as clay and certain minerals that would  cause undesirable coloring of the glass.  Classifying  the  sand means grouping the grains according to size. The  most desirable particle size for glassmaking is in the  range of 0.1 to $0.6\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.004–0.025 in) [3]. The various  other components, such as soda ash (source of  $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{l}$ ),  limestone (source of  $\mathrm{CaO}$ ), aluminum oxide, potash

(source of  $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ ), and other minerals are added in the proper proportions to achieve  the desired composition. The mixing is usually done in batches, in amounts that are  compatible with the capacities of available melting furnaces.  

Recycled glass is usually added to the mixture in modern practice. In addition  to preserving the environment, recycled glass facilitates melting. Depending on the  amount of waste glass available and the speciﬁ  cations of the ﬁ  nal composition, the  proportion of recycled glass may be up to $100\%$ .  

The batch of starting materials to be melted is referred to as a  charge , and the pro- cedure of loading it into the melting furnace is called  charging  the furnace. Glass- melting furnaces can be divided into the following types [3]: (1)  pot furnaces —  ceramic pots of limited capacity in which melting occurs by heating the walls of the  pot; (2)  day tanks —larger capacity vessels for batch production in which heating is  done by burning fuels above the charge; (3)  continuous tank furnaces —long tank  furnaces in which raw materials are fed in one end, and melted as they move to the  other end where molten glass is drawn out for high production; and (4)  electric fur- naces  of various designs for a wide range of production rates. The roof of the furnace assists the heating action by reﬂ  ecting the ﬂ  ame  down against the charge. Typical fuel is natural gas, and the combustion products  exit the furnace through a stack. At the bottom of the hearth is a tap hole to release  the molten metal. Direct fuel-ﬁ  red furnaces are generally used in casting for melting  nonferrous metals such as copper-base alloys and aluminum.  

Crucible Furnaces   These furnaces melt the metal without direct contact with a  burning fuel mixture. For this reason, they are sometimes called  indirect fuel-ﬁ  red  furnaces . Three types of crucible furnaces are used in foundries: (a) lift-out type, (b)  stationary, and (c) tilting, illustrated in Figure 11.21. They all utilize a container (the  crucible) made out of a suitable refractory material (e.g., a clay–graphite mixture) or  

![](images/21b29484849a3c5cdb1f1a033c8f21cf44d7dfd2b59bac98b59966df0a7aa1f6.jpg)  
FIGURE 11.21  Three types of crucible furnaces: (a) lift-out crucible, (b) stationary pot, and (c) tilting-pot furnace.  

high-temperature steel alloy to hold the charge. In the  lift-out crucible furnace , the  crucible is placed in a furnace and heated sufﬁ  ciently to melt the metal charge. Oil, gas,  or powdered coal are typical fuels for these furnaces. When the metal is melted, the  crucible is lifted out of the furnace and used as a pouring ladle. The other two types,  sometimes referred to as  pot furnaces , have the heating furnace and container as one  integral unit. In the  stationary pot furnace , the furnace is stationary and the molten  metal is ladled out of the container. In the  tilting-pot furnace , the entire assembly can  be tilted for pouring. Crucible furnaces are used for nonferrous metals such as bronze,  brass, and alloys of zinc and aluminum. Furnace capacities are generally limited to  several hundred pounds.  

Electric-Arc Furnaces   In this furnace type, the charge is melted by heat gener- ated from an electric arc. Various conﬁ  gurations are available, with two or three  electrodes (Figure 6.9). Power consumption is high, but electric-arc furnaces can be  designed for high melting capacity  $(23\mathrm{,}000{-}45\mathrm{,}000\;\mathrm{kg/hr}$  or 25–50 tons/hr), and they  are used primarily for casting steel.  

Induction Furnaces   An induction furnace uses alternating current passing  through a coil to develop a magnetic ﬁ  eld in the metal, and the resulting induced  current causes rapid heating and melting of the metal. Features of an induction  furnace for foundry operations are illustrated in Figure 11.22. The electromagnetic  

![](images/ce6a41b92b31743bce32a581227fea81f50746a2c3e4088f97f66bd629e5b4b6.jpg)  

force ﬁ  eld causes a mixing action to occur in the liquid metal. Also, since the metal  does not come in direct contact with the heating elements, the environment in which  melting takes place can be closely controlled. All of this results in molten metals of  high quality and purity, and induction furnaces are used for nearly any casting alloy  when these requirements are important. Melting steel, cast iron, and aluminum al- loys are common applications in foundry work.  

# 11.4.2  POURING, CLEANING, AND HEAT TREATMENT  

Moving the molten metal from the melting furnace to the mold is sometimes done  using crucibles. More often, the transfer is accomplished by  ladles  of various kinds.  These ladles receive the metal from the furnace and allow for convenient pouring  into the molds. Two common ladles are illustrated in Figure 11.23, one for handling  large volumes of molten metal using an overhead crane, and the other a “two-man  ladle” for manually moving and pouring smaller amounts.  

One of the problems in pouring is that oxidized molten metal can be introduced  into the mold.

Describe the spinning process in glassworking.,"Answer. Spinning in glassworking is similar to centrifugal casting in metalworking. A gob of molten glass is dropped in to a conical mold which spins, causing centrifugal force to spread the glass upward onto the mold surface.","The spinning process in glassworking involves forming funnel-shaped glass components using a method similar to centrifugal casting. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Gob Insertion**: A gob of molten glass is deposited into a steel conical mold. This mold is specially designed to facilitate the spreading of the glass material.

2. **Rotation**: The mold is rotated at high speeds. The centrifugal force generated by this rotation causes the molten glass to flow upward and spread evenly along the mold's inner surface.

3. **Shaping**: As the glass spreads, it assumes the shape of the mold, resulting in a uniformly formed funnel-like structure. The rotation ensures even distribution and thickness of the glass.

4. **Cooling**: Once the desired shape and thickness are achieved, the glass is cooled to solidify and maintain its shape. This may occur naturally or be assisted by controlled cooling processes to prevent internal stresses and ensure integrity.

The spinning process is efficient for producing large volumes of uniformly shaped glass components, and it is extensively used for items such as the back sections of cathode ray tubes for televisions and computer monitors. This method ensures precision and consistency, critical for high-quality glass products.","The rolled glass sheet must later be ground and polished  for parallelism and smoothness.

FIGURE 12.7  The ﬂ  oat  process for producing  sheet glass.  

Float Process  This process was developed in the late 1950s. Its advantage over  other methods such as rolling is that it obtains smooth surfaces that need no sub- sequent ﬁ  nishing. In the  ﬂ  oat process , illustrated in Figure 12.7, the glass ﬂ  ows di- rectly from its melting furnace onto the surface of a molten tin bath. The highly ﬂ  uid  glass spreads evenly across the molten tin surface, achieving a uniform thickness and  smoothness. After moving into a cooler region of the bath, the glass hardens and  travels through an annealing furnace, after which it is cut to size.  

Drawing of Glass Tubes  Glass tubing is manufactured by a drawing process  known as the  Danner process , illustrated in Figure 12.8. Molten glass ﬂ  ows around a  rotating hollow mandrel through which air is blown while the glass is being drawn.  The air temperature and its volumetric ﬂ  ow rate, as well as the drawing velocity,

determine the diameter and wall thickness of the tubular cross section. During hard- ening, the glass tube is supported by a series of rollers extending about  $30\:\mathrm{m}$  (100 ft)  beyond the mandrel. The continuous tubing is then cut into standard lengths.  Tubular glass products include laboratory glassware, ﬂ  uorescent light tubes, and  thermometers.  

# 12.2.3  FORMING OF GLASS FIBERS  

Glass ﬁ  bers are used in applications ranging from insulation wool to ﬁ  ber optics  communications lines (Section 7.4.2). Glass ﬁ  ber products can be divided into two  categories [6]: (1) ﬁ  brous glass for thermal insulation, acoustical insulation, and air  ﬁ  ltration, in which the ﬁ  bers are in a random, wool-like condition; and (2) long, con- tinuous ﬁ  laments suitable for ﬁ  ber-reinforced plastics, yarns and fabrics, and ﬁ  ber  optics. Different production methods are used for the two categories. Two methods  are described in the following paragraphs, representing each of the product catego- ries, respectively.  

Centrifugal Spraying  In a typical process for making glass wool, molten glass  ﬂ  ows into a rotating bowl with many small oriﬁ  ces around its periphery. Centrifugal  force causes the glass to ﬂ  ow through the holes to become a ﬁ  brous mass suitable for  thermal and acoustical insulation.  

Drawing of Continuous Filaments  In this process, illustrated in Figure 12.9,  continuous glass ﬁ  bers of small diameter (lower size limit is around  $0.0025~\mathrm{mm}$  or  0.0001 in) are produced by drawing strands of molten glass through small oriﬁ  ces in  

![](images/e1e4c821dae73b6f342df55b4ed2db4a27612da7df8041b383997d82deaa4389.jpg)  

a heated plate made of a platinum alloy. The plate may have several hundred holes,  each making one ﬁ  ber. The individual ﬁ  bers are collected into a strand by reeling  them onto a spool. The batch of starting materials to be melted is referred to as a  charge , and the pro- cedure of loading it into the melting furnace is called  charging  the furnace. Glass- melting furnaces can be divided into the following types [3]: (1)  pot furnaces —  ceramic pots of limited capacity in which melting occurs by heating the walls of the  pot; (2)  day tanks —larger capacity vessels for batch production in which heating is  done by burning fuels above the charge; (3)  continuous tank furnaces —long tank  furnaces in which raw materials are fed in one end, and melted as they move to the  other end where molten glass is drawn out for high production; and (4)  electric fur- naces  of various designs for a wide range of production rates.  

Glass melting is generally carried out at temperatures around  $1500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to  $1600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ $(2700^{\circ}\mathrm{F}{-}2900^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ). The melting cycle for a typical charge takes 24 to 48 hours. This  is the time required for all of the sand grains to become a clear liquid and for the  molten glass to be reﬁ  ned and cooled to the appropriate temperature for working.  Molten glass is a viscous liquid, the viscosity being inversely related to temperature.  Because the shaping operation immediately follows the melting cycle, the tempera- ture at which the glass is tapped from the furnace depends on the viscosity required  for the subsequent process.  

#  Shaping Processes in Glassworking  

The major categories of glass products were identiﬁ  ed in Section 7.4.2 as window  glass, containers, light bulbs, laboratory glassware, glass ﬁ  bers, and optical glass. De- spite the variety represented by this list, the shaping processes to fabricate these  products can be grouped into only three categories: (1) discrete processes for piece  ware, which includes bottles, light bulbs, and other individual items; (2) continuous  processes for making ﬂ  at glass (sheet and plate glass for windows) and tubing (for  laboratory ware and ﬂ  uorescent lights); and (3) ﬁ  ber-making processes to produce  ﬁ  bers for insulation, ﬁ  berglass composite materials, and ﬁ  ber optics.  

# 12.2.1  SHAPING OF PIECE WARE  

The ancient methods of hand-working glass, such as glass blowing, were brieﬂ  y  described in Historical Note 7.3. Handicraft methods are still employed today for  making glassware items of high value in small quantities. Most of the processes

discussed in this section are highly mechanized technologies for producing discrete  pieces such as jars, bottles, and light bulbs in high quantities.  

Spinning  Glass spinning is similar to  centrifugal casting  of metals, and is also  known by that name in glassworking. It is used to produce funnel-shaped compo- nents such as the back sections of cathode ray tubes for televisions and computer  monitors. The setup is pictured in Figure 12.2. A gob of molten glass is dropped into  a conical mold made of steel. The mold is rotated so that centrifugal force causes  the glass to ﬂ  ow upward and spread itself on the mold surface. The faceplate (i.e.,  the front viewing screen) is later assembled to the funnel using a sealing glass of low  melting point.  

Pressing  This is a widely used process for mass producing glass pieces such as dishes,  bake ware, headlight lenses, TV tube faceplates, and similar items that are relatively  ﬂ  at. The process is illustrated and described in Figure 12.3. The large quantities of most  pressed products justify a high level of automation in this production sequence.

What is the main difference between the press-and-blow and the blow-and-blow shaping processes in glassworking?,"Answer. In the press-and-blow process, the initial forming step is pressing of the part, while the first step in the blow-and-blow process is blowing.","The main difference between the press-and-blow and the blow-and-blow processes in glassworking lies in their initial forming steps:

1. **Press-and-Blow Process**:
   - This method starts with a **pressing operation**. A molten gob of glass is fed into a mold cavity, and a plunger is used to press the gob into a parison (a preliminary shape).
   - After the initial pressing, the parison is transferred to a blow mold where air is blown into it, expanding the glass to its final shape.
   - This process is primarily used for producing wide-mouth containers.

2. **Blow-and-Blow Process**:
   - This method uses blowing operations for both forming steps. Initially, a molten gob is dropped into a mold and partially inflated using air to form a preliminary shape.
   - The partially formed piece is then transferred to a second blow mold, where it undergoes a second blowing operation to achieve the final shape.
   - The blow-and-blow process is typically used for making containers with narrower mouths.

In summary, the distinction lies in the initial forming technique: pressing followed by blowing in the press-and-blow method, versus two sequential blowing operations in the blow-and-blow method.","A gob of molten glass is dropped into  a conical mold made of steel.

# 12.2.2  SHAPING OF FLAT AND TUBULAR GLASS  

Two methods for making plate glass and one method for producing tube stock are  described here. They are continuous processes, in which long sections of ﬂ  at window  glass or glass tubing are made and later cut into appropriate sizes and lengths. They  are modern technologies in contrast to the ancient method described in Historical  Note 12.1.  

# Historical Note 12.1  Ancient methods of making ﬂ  at glass  [7]  

Glass windows have been used in buildings for many  centuries. The oldest process for making ﬂ  at window  glass was by manual glass blowing. The procedure  consisted of the following: (1) a glass globe was blown  on a blowpipe; (2) a portion of the globe was made  to stick to the end of a “punty, ” a metal rod used by  glassblowers, and then detached from the blowpipe;  and (3) after reheating the glass, the punty was rotated  with sufﬁ  cient speed for centrifugal force to shape the  open globe into a ﬂ  at disk. The disk, whose maximum  possible size was only about  $1\,\mathrm{~m~}$  (3 ft), was later cut  into small panes for windows.  

At the center of the disk, where the glass was  attached to the punty during the third step in the  process, a lump would tend to form that had the ap- pearance of a crown. The name “crown glass” was  derived from this resemblance. Lenses for spectacles  were ground from glass made by this method. Today,  the name crown glass is still used for certain types  of optical and ophthalmic glass, even though the an- cient method has been replaced by modern produc- tion technology.  

Rolling of Flat Plate  Flat plate glass can be produced by rolling, as illustrated in  Figure 12.6. The starting glass, in a suitably plastic condition from the furnace, is  squeezed through opposing rolls whose separation determines the thickness of the  sheet. The rolling operation is usually set up so that the ﬂ  at glass is moved directly  into an annealing furnace. The rolled glass sheet must later be ground and polished  for parallelism and smoothness.

FIGURE 12.7  The ﬂ  oat  process for producing  sheet glass.  

Float Process  This process was developed in the late 1950s. Its advantage over  other methods such as rolling is that it obtains smooth surfaces that need no sub- sequent ﬁ  nishing. # 13.8.1 BLOW MOLDING  

Blow molding is a molding process in which air pressure is used to inﬂ  ate soft plas- tic inside a mold cavity. It is an important industrial process for making one-piece  hollow plastic parts with thin walls, such as bottles and similar containers. Because  many of these items are used for consumer beverages for mass markets, production  is typically organized for very high quantities. The technology is borrowed from the  glass industry (Section 12.2.1) with which plastics compete in the disposable and  recyclable bottle market.  

Blow molding is accomplished in two steps: (1) fabrication of a starting tube of  molten plastic, called a  parison  (same as in glass-blowing); and (2) inﬂ  ation of the  

![](images/715928aa8fb1e2fac218ff93a8ba54f9c51528ef8323c47925d6aea9647302c8.jpg)

tube to the desired ﬁ  nal shape. Forming the parison is accomplished by either extru- sion or injection molding.  

Extrusion Blow Molding   This form of blow molding consists of the cycle illus- trated in Figure 13.31. In most cases, the process is organized as a very high pro- duction operation for making plastic bottles. The sequence is automated and often  integrated with downstream operations such as bottle ﬁ  lling and labeling.  

It is usually a requirement that the blown container be rigid, and rigidity depends  on wall thickness among other factors. The wall thickness of the blown container  can be related to the starting extruded parison [12], assuming a cylindrical shape for  the ﬁ  nal product. The effect of die swell on the parison is shown in Figure 13.32. The  mean diameter of the tube as it exits the die is determined by the mean die diameter  

![](images/e2f251c70e61842f0e9efd6c250dbefc76ef3c9c4066e40347c32df1a6116c5b.jpg)  
FIGURE 13.32  (1) Dimensions of  extrusion die, showing  parison after die swell;  and (2) ﬁ  nal blow-molded  container in extrusion  blow molding.  

$D_{d}$ . Die swell causes expansion to a mean parison diameter  $D_{p}$ . At the same time,  wall thickness swells from $t_{d}$  to $t_{p}$ . The swell ratio of the parison diameter and wall  thickness is given by  

$$
r_{s}=\frac{D_{p}}{D_{d}}=\frac{t_{p}}{t_{d}}
$$  

When the parison is inﬂ  ated to the blow mold diameter $D_{m}$ , there is a corresponding  reduction in wall thickness to  $t_{m}$ . Assuming constant volume of cross section,  

$$
{\pi}D_{p}t_{p}={\pi}D_{m}t_{m}
$$  

Solving for  $t_{m}$  

$$
t_{m}={\frac{D_{p}t_{p}}{D_{m}}}
$$  

Substituting Equation (13.20) into this equation,  

$$
t_{m}=\frac{r_{s}^{2}t_{d}D_{d}}{D_{m}}
$$  

The amount of die swell in the initial extrusion process can be measured by direct  observation; and the dimensions of the die are known. Thus, the wall thickness on  the blow-molded container can be determined.  

Injection Blow Molding   In this process, the starting parison is injection molded  rather than extruded. A simpliﬁ  ed sequence is outlined in Figure 13.33.

There are several ways of shaping plate or sheet glass. Name and briefly describe one of them.,"Answer. The methods described in this test are: (1) rolling, in which the hot glass is squeezed between opposing cylindrical rolls; and (2) the float process, in which the melted glass flows onto a molten tin surface to achieve uniform thickness and smoothness.","One method for shaping plate or sheet glass is the **float process**. Developed in the late 1950s, this method involves floating a continuous ribbon of molten glass over a bath of molten tin. The glass spreads out and forms a smooth surface under the influence of gravity and surface tension. The ribbon then passes through a controlled atmosphere for cooling before being cut into desired lengths. The float process produces glass with high optical quality and uniform thickness without the need for subsequent grinding or polishing, making it the preferred method for manufacturing window glass.","Reheating is sometimes required between blowing steps.

the production of wide-mouth containers. A split mold is used in the blowing opera- tion for part removal. The  blow-and-blow  method is used to produce smaller-mouthed bottles. The se- quence is similar to the preceding, except that two (or more) blowing operations are  used rather than pressing and blowing. There are variations to the process, depend- ing on the geometry of the product, with one possible sequence shown in Figure 12.5.

Reheating is sometimes required between blowing steps. Duplicate and triplicate  molds are sometimes used along with matching gob feeders to increase production  rates. Press-and-blow and blow-and-blow methods are used to make jars, beverage  bottles, incandescent light bulb enclosures, and similar geometries.  

Casting  If the molten glass is sufﬁ  ciently ﬂ  uid, it can be poured into a mold. Rela- tively massive objects, such as astronomical lenses and mirrors, are made by this  method. These pieces must be cooled very slowly to avoid internal stresses and pos- sible cracking owing to temperature gradients that would otherwise be set up in  the glass. After cooling and solidifying, the piece must be ﬁ  nished by lapping and  polishing. Casting is not much used in glassworking except for these kinds of special  jobs. # Glassworking

12.4 Product Design Considerations  

Glass products are commercially manufactured in an  almost unlimited variety of shapes. Many are produced  in very large quantities, such as light bulbs, beverage  bottles, and window glass. Others, such as giant tele- scope lenses, are made individually.  

Glass is one of three basic types of ceramics (Chap- ter 7). It is distinguished by its noncrystalline (vitreous)  structure, whereas the other ceramic materials have  a crystalline structure. The methods by which glass is  shaped into useful products are quite different from  those used for the other types. In glassworking, the  principal starting material is silica  $(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ ; this is usually  combined with other oxide ceramics that form glasses.  The starting material is heated to transform it from a  hard solid into a viscous liquid; it is then shaped into  the desired geometry while in this highly plastic or ﬂ  uid  condition. When cooled and hard, the material remains  in the glassy state rather than crystallizing.  

The typical manufacturing sequence in glassworking  consists of the steps pictured in Figure 12.1. Shaping is  accomplished by various processes, including casting,  pressing-and-blowing (to produce bottles and other  containers), and rolling (to make plate glass). A ﬁ  nish- ing step is required for certain products.

# Raw Materials  Preparation and  Melting  

The main component in nearly all glasses is silica, the  primary source of which is natural quartz in sand. The  sand must be washed and classiﬁ  ed. Washing removes  impurities such as clay and certain minerals that would  cause undesirable coloring of the glass.  Classifying  the  sand means grouping the grains according to size. The  most desirable particle size for glassmaking is in the  range of 0.1 to $0.6\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.004–0.025 in) [3]. The various  other components, such as soda ash (source of  $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{l}$ ),  limestone (source of  $\mathrm{CaO}$ ), aluminum oxide, potash

(source of  $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ ), and other minerals are added in the proper proportions to achieve  the desired composition. The mixing is usually done in batches, in amounts that are  compatible with the capacities of available melting furnaces.  

Recycled glass is usually added to the mixture in modern practice. In addition  to preserving the environment, recycled glass facilitates melting. Depending on the  amount of waste glass available and the speciﬁ  cations of the ﬁ  nal composition, the  proportion of recycled glass may be up to $100\%$ .  

The batch of starting materials to be melted is referred to as a  charge , and the pro- cedure of loading it into the melting furnace is called  charging  the furnace. Glass- melting furnaces can be divided into the following types [3]: (1)  pot furnaces —  ceramic pots of limited capacity in which melting occurs by heating the walls of the  pot; (2)  day tanks —larger capacity vessels for batch production in which heating is  done by burning fuels above the charge; (3)  continuous tank furnaces —long tank  furnaces in which raw materials are fed in one end, and melted as they move to the  other end where molten glass is drawn out for high production; and (4)  electric fur- naces  of various designs for a wide range of production rates.

Describe the Danner process?,"Answer. In the Danner process, molten glass flows around a rotating hollow mandrel through which air is blown while the glass is being drawn. The temperature of the air and its volumetric flow rate as well as the drawing velocity determine the diameter and wall thickness of the tubular cross-section. During hardening, the glass tube is supported by a series of rollers extending beyond the mandrel.","The Danner process is a method used in the manufacturing of glass tubing. In this process, molten glass is drawn through a rotating hollow mandrel and subsequently elongated to form thin tubes. This is achieved by precisely controlling the speed at which the glass is drawn and the temperature of the molten glass, ensuring uniform wall thickness and diameter. The process allows for high production rates and the creation of tubes with consistent dimensional tolerances, which are essential in various applications such as laboratory glassware, pharmaceutical containers, and other industrial uses. The Danner process is notable for its efficiency and the high-quality outcomes it produces.","The advantage of the Guerin process is the relatively low cost of the tooling.  The form block can be made of wood, plastic, or other materials that are easy to  shape, and the rubber pad can be used with different form blocks. These factors

make rubber forming attractive in small-quantity production, such as the aircraft  industry, where the process was developed.  

Hydroforming  Hydroforming is similar to the Guerin process; the difference  is that it substitutes a rubber diaphragm ﬁ  lled with hydraulic ﬂ  uid in place of the  thick rubber pad, as illustrated in Figure 19.29. This allows the pressure that forms  the work part to be increased—to around  $100\;\mathrm{MPa}$  ( $\cdot15{,}000\ \mathrm{lb/in}^{2}\$ ) —thus prevent- ing wrinkling in deep formed parts. In fact, deeper draws can be achieved with the  hydroform process than with conventional deep drawing. This is because the uni- form pressure in hydroforming forces the work to contact the punch throughout its  length, thus increasing friction and reducing the tensile stresses that cause tearing at  the base of the drawn cup.  

#  Dies and Presses for Sheet-Metal Processes  

This section examines the punch-and-die tooling and production equipment used in  conventional sheet-metal processing.  

# 19.5.1  DIES  

Nearly all of the preceding pressworking operations are performed with conventional  punch-and-die tooling. The tooling is referred to as a  die . It is custom-  designed for  the particular part to be produced. The term  stamping die  is sometimes used for high- production dies. Typical materials for stamping dies are tool steel types D, A, O, and  S (Table 6.5).  

Components of a Stamping Die  The components of a stamping die to perform  a simple blanking operation are illustrated in Figure 19.30. The working components  are the  punch  and  die , which perform the cutting operation. They are attached to  

![](images/ad5b406287c0422b07a6d716257e3ef4107701464a4c80568af0eb44e00268ea.jpg)  
FIGURE 19.30  Components of a punch  and die for a blanking  operation.  

the upper and lower portions of the  die set , respectively called the  punch holder  (or  upper shoe ) and  die holder  ( lower shoe ). The die set also includes guide pins and  bushings to ensure proper alignment between the punch and die during the stamping  operation. The die holder is attached to the base of the press, and the punch holder is  attached to the ram. Actuation of the ram accomplishes the pressworking operation.  

In addition to these components, a die used for blanking or hole-punching must  include a means of preventing the sheet metal from sticking to the punch when it is  retracted upward after the operation. The newly created hole in the stock is the same  size as the punch, and it tends to cling to the punch on its withdrawal. The device  in the die that strips the sheet metal from the punch is called a  stripper . It is often  a simple plate attached to the die as in Figure 19.30, with a hole slightly larger than  the punch diameter.  

For dies that process strips or coils of sheet metal, a device is required to stop the  sheet metal as it advances through the die between press cycles. ![](images/5aa7ac66afbfc2792b72b072765bfb8fd1b4f83eea01f6cd05dccc580d60c825.jpg)  
FIGURE 14.16  Coating  of fabric with rubber  using a calendering  process.  

Alternatives to calendering include skimming, dipping, and spraying. In the  skimming  process, a thick solution of rubber compound in an organic solvent is  applied to the fabric as it is unreeled from a supply spool. The coated fabric passes  under a doctor blade that skims the solvent to the proper thickness, and then moves  into a steam chamber where the solvent is driven off by heat. As its name suggests,  dipping  involves temporary immersion of the fabric into a highly ﬂ  uid solution of  rubber, followed by drying. In  spraying , a spray gun is used to apply the rubber  solution.  

Molding and Casting  Molded articles include shoe soles and heels, gaskets and  seals, suction cups, and bottle stops. Many foamed rubber parts are produced by  molding. In addition, molding is an important process in tire production. Principal  molding processes for rubber are (1) compression molding, (2) transfer molding,  and (3) injection molding. Compression molding is the most important technique  because of its use in tire manufacture. Curing (vulcanizing) is accomplished in the  mold in all three processes, this representing a departure from the shaping methods  already discussed, which require a separate vulcanizing step. With injection mold- ing of rubber, there are risks of premature curing similar to those faced in the same  process when applied to thermosetting plastics. Advantages of injection molding  over traditional methods for producing rubber parts include better dimensional  control, less scrap, and shorter cycle times. In addition to its use in the molding of  conventional rubbers, injection molding is also applied for thermoplastic elastom- ers. Because of high mold costs, large production quantities are required to justify  injection molding.  

A form of casting, called  dip casting , is used for producing rubber gloves and  overshoes. It involves submersion of a positive mold in a liquid polymer (or a heated  form into plastisol) for a certain duration (the process may involve repeated dip- pings) to form the desired thickness. The coating is then stripped from the form and  cured to cross-link the rubber.  

# 14.5.4  VULCANIZATION  

Vulcanization is the treatment that accomplishes cross-linking of elastomer mol- ecules, so that the rubber becomes stiffer and stronger but retains extensibility. It  is a critical step in the rubber processing sequence. On a submicroscopic scale, the  process can be pictured as in Figure 14.17, in which the long-chain molecules of  

![](images/6be5e72653c45e94acf0058dcfb12a9d2d63bb9d8583d61e584030ca73c863d9.jpg)  
FIGURE 14.17  Effect  of vulcanization on the  rubber   molecules: (1) raw  rubber; (2)   vulcanized  (cross-linked) rubber.  Variations of (2) include  (a) soft rubber, low  degree of cross-linking;  and (b) hard rubber, high  degree of cross-linking.  

the rubber become joined at certain tie points, the effect of which is to reduce the  ability of the elastomer to ﬂ  ow. A typical soft rubber has one or two cross-links per  thousand units (mers). As the number of cross-links increases, the polymer becomes  stiffer and behaves more like a thermosetting plastic (hard rubber).  

Vulcanization, as it was ﬁ  rst invented by Charles Goodyear in 1839, involved the  use of sulfur (about 8 parts by weight of S mixed with 100 parts of natural rubber) at  a temperature of $140^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\left(280^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\right)$  for about 5 hours. No other chemicals were included  in the process. Vulcanization with sulfur alone is no longer used as a commercial  treatment today, because of the long curing times. DPN can be used to “write” patterns of molecules onto  a surface, in which the patterns are of submicron dimension. Line widths as small as  10 to $15\,\mathrm{nm}$  are reported [27]. In addition, DPN can be used to deposit different types  of molecules at different locations on the substrate surface.

FIGURE 36.5  Dip-pen nano- lithography, in which the tip of  an atomic force microscope  is used to deposit molecules  through the water meniscus  that forms naturally between  the tip and the substrate.  

Self-Assembly  Self-assembly is a fundamental process in nature. The natural for- mation of a crystalline structure during the slow cooling of molten minerals is an  example of nonliving self-assembly. The growth of living organisms is an example  of biological self-assembly. In both instances, entities at the atomic and molecular  level combine on their own into larger entities, proceeding in a constructive manner  toward the creation of some deliberate thing. If the thing is a living organism, the  inter  mediate entities are biological cells, and the organism is grown through an addi- tive process that exhibits massive replication of individual cell formations, yet the ﬁ  nal  result is often remarkably intricate and complex (e.g., a human being).  

One of the promising bottom-up approaches in nanotechnology involves the  emulation of nature’s self-assembly process to produce materials and systems that  have nanometer-scale features or building blocks, but the ﬁ  nal product may be  larger than nanoscale. It may be of micro- or macro-scale size, at least in some  of its dimensions. The term  biomimetics  describes this process of building arti- ﬁ  cial, nonbiological entities by imitating nature’s methods. Desirable attributes  of atomic or molecular self-assembly processes in nanotechnology include the  following: (1) they can be carried out rapidly; (2) they occur automatically and do  not require any central control; (3) they exhibit massive replication; and (4) they  can be performed under mild environmental conditions (at or near atmospheric  pressure and room temperature). Self-assembly is likely to be the most important  of the nanofabrication processes because of its low cost, its capacity for producing  structures over a range of sizes (from nanoscale to macroscale), and its general  applicability to a wide variety of products [19].  

An underlying principle behind self-assembly is the principle of minimum energy.  Physical entities such as atoms and molecules seek out a state that minimizes the total  energy of the system of which they are components. This principle has the following  implications for self-assembly:  

1.  There must be some mechanism for the movement of the entities (e.g., atoms,  molecules, ions) in the system, thus causing the entities to come into close proxi- mity with one another. Possible mechanisms for this movement include diffu- sion, convection in a ﬂ  uid, and electric ﬁ  elds.

 2.  There must be some form of molecular recognition among the entities. Molecular  recognition refers to the tendency of one molecule (or atom or ion) to be attracted  to and bind with another molecule (or atom or ion), for example, the way sodium  and chlorine are attracted to each other to form table salt.

 3.  The molecular recognition among the entities causes them to join in such a way  that the resulting physical arrangement of the entities achieves a state of mini- mum energy. The joining process involves chemical bonding, usually the weaker  secondary types (e.g., van der Waals bonds).  

At least two instances of molecular-level self-assembly have previously been  encountered in this book: (1) crystal formation and (2) polymerization. Crystal for- mation in metals, ceramics, and certain polymers is a form of self-assembly. Growing  silicon boules in the Czochralski process (Section 33.2.2) for fabrication of integrated  circuits is a good illustration. Using a starting seed crystal, very pure molten silicon  is formed into a large cylindrical solid whose repeating lattice structure matches that  of the seed throughout its volume. The lattice spacing in the crystal structure is of  nanometer proportions, but the replication exhibits long-range order.

Two processes for forming glass fibers are discussed in the text. Name and briefly describe one of them.,"Answer. The two processes in the text are: (1) drawing, in which fine glass fibers are pulled through small orifices in a heated plate; and (2) centrifugal spraying, in which molten glass is forced to flow through small orifices in a rapidly rotating bowl to form glass fibers.","One of the processes for forming glass fibers discussed in the text is ""Centrifugal Spraying."" In this process, molten glass is introduced into a rotating bowl equipped with numerous small orifices around its periphery. The centrifugal force pushes the molten glass through these holes, forming a fibrous mass. This mass is suitable for applications like thermal and acoustical insulation. The result is a glass wool structure, which is characterized by its random, wool-like condition. This method is efficient for creating fibrous glass products used in insulation.","# Glassworking

The rolled glass sheet must later be ground and polished  for parallelism and smoothness.

FIGURE 12.7  The ﬂ  oat  process for producing  sheet glass.  

Float Process  This process was developed in the late 1950s. Its advantage over  other methods such as rolling is that it obtains smooth surfaces that need no sub- sequent ﬁ  nishing. In the  ﬂ  oat process , illustrated in Figure 12.7, the glass ﬂ  ows di- rectly from its melting furnace onto the surface of a molten tin bath. The highly ﬂ  uid  glass spreads evenly across the molten tin surface, achieving a uniform thickness and  smoothness. After moving into a cooler region of the bath, the glass hardens and  travels through an annealing furnace, after which it is cut to size.  

Drawing of Glass Tubes  Glass tubing is manufactured by a drawing process  known as the  Danner process , illustrated in Figure 12.8. Molten glass ﬂ  ows around a  rotating hollow mandrel through which air is blown while the glass is being drawn.

determine the diameter and wall thickness of the tubular cross section. During hard- ening, the glass tube is supported by a series of rollers extending about  $30\:\mathrm{m}$  (100 ft)  beyond the mandrel. The continuous tubing is then cut into standard lengths.  Tubular glass products include laboratory glassware, ﬂ  uorescent light tubes, and  thermometers.  

# 12.2.3  FORMING OF GLASS FIBERS  

Glass ﬁ  bers are used in applications ranging from insulation wool to ﬁ  ber optics  communications lines (Section 7.4.2). Glass ﬁ  ber products can be divided into two  categories [6]: (1) ﬁ  brous glass for thermal insulation, acoustical insulation, and air  ﬁ  ltration, in which the ﬁ  bers are in a random, wool-like condition; and (2) long, con- tinuous ﬁ  laments suitable for ﬁ  ber-reinforced plastics, yarns and fabrics, and ﬁ  ber  optics. Different production methods are used for the two categories. Two methods  are described in the following paragraphs, representing each of the product catego- ries, respectively.  

Centrifugal Spraying  In a typical process for making glass wool, molten glass  ﬂ  ows into a rotating bowl with many small oriﬁ  ces around its periphery. Centrifugal  force causes the glass to ﬂ  ow through the holes to become a ﬁ  brous mass suitable for  thermal and acoustical insulation.

Reheating is sometimes required between blowing steps. Duplicate and triplicate  molds are sometimes used along with matching gob feeders to increase production  rates. Press-and-blow and blow-and-blow methods are used to make jars, beverage  bottles, incandescent light bulb enclosures, and similar geometries.  

Casting  If the molten glass is sufﬁ  ciently ﬂ  uid, it can be poured into a mold. Rela- tively massive objects, such as astronomical lenses and mirrors, are made by this  method. These pieces must be cooled very slowly to avoid internal stresses and pos- sible cracking owing to temperature gradients that would otherwise be set up in  the glass. After cooling and solidifying, the piece must be ﬁ  nished by lapping and  polishing. Casting is not much used in glassworking except for these kinds of special  jobs. Not only is cooling and cracking a problem, but also molten glass is relatively  viscous at normal working temperatures, and does not ﬂ  ow through small oriﬁ  ces or  into small sections as well as molten metals or heated thermoplastics. Smaller lenses  are usually made by pressing, discussed above.  

# 12.2.2  SHAPING OF FLAT AND TUBULAR GLASS  

Two methods for making plate glass and one method for producing tube stock are  described here. They are continuous processes, in which long sections of ﬂ  at window  glass or glass tubing are made and later cut into appropriate sizes and lengths. They  are modern technologies in contrast to the ancient method described in Historical  Note 12.1.  

# Historical Note 12.1  Ancient methods of making ﬂ  at glass  [7]  

Glass windows have been used in buildings for many  centuries. The oldest process for making ﬂ  at window  glass was by manual glass blowing. The procedure  consisted of the following: (1) a glass globe was blown  on a blowpipe; (2) a portion of the globe was made  to stick to the end of a “punty, ” a metal rod used by  glassblowers, and then detached from the blowpipe;  and (3) after reheating the glass, the punty was rotated  with sufﬁ  cient speed for centrifugal force to shape the  open globe into a ﬂ  at disk. The disk, whose maximum  possible size was only about  $1\,\mathrm{~m~}$  (3 ft), was later cut  into small panes for windows.  

At the center of the disk, where the glass was  attached to the punty during the third step in the  process, a lump would tend to form that had the ap- pearance of a crown. The name “crown glass” was  derived from this resemblance. Lenses for spectacles  were ground from glass made by this method. Today,  the name crown glass is still used for certain types  of optical and ophthalmic glass, even though the an- cient method has been replaced by modern produc- tion technology.  

Rolling of Flat Plate  Flat plate glass can be produced by rolling, as illustrated in  Figure 12.6. The starting glass, in a suitably plastic condition from the furnace, is  squeezed through opposing rolls whose separation determines the thickness of the  sheet. The rolling operation is usually set up so that the ﬂ  at glass is moved directly  into an annealing furnace. The rolled glass sheet must later be ground and polished  for parallelism and smoothness.

What is the purpose of annealing in glassworking?,Answer. Annealing is performed on glass to remove internal stresses that result from shaping and solidification.,"The purpose of annealing in glassworking is to relieve undesirable internal stresses that are introduced during the forming process. These stresses, if not alleviated, can significantly reduce the strength of the glass, making it more prone to cracking or breaking. 

Annealing involves heating the glass to an elevated temperature, typically around \(500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\), and maintaining it there to allow the stresses to gradually dissipate. The glass is then slowly cooled to room temperature to suppress the formation of new stresses and ensure a uniform temperature gradient within the material. This controlled cooling process allows the glass to stabilize without developing tension that could lead to defects.

In modern glass factories, annealing is done in tunnel-like furnaces called lehrs, where the glass products are conveyed through a controlled heating and cooling cycle. This process ensures that the final glass products possess enhanced mechanical properties, such as increased strength and reliability.","Drawing of Continuous Filaments  In this process, illustrated in Figure 12.9,  continuous glass ﬁ  bers of small diameter (lower size limit is around  $0.0025~\mathrm{mm}$  or  0.0001 in) are produced by drawing strands of molten glass through small oriﬁ  ces in

a heated plate made of a platinum alloy. The plate may have several hundred holes,  each making one ﬁ  ber. The individual ﬁ  bers are collected into a strand by reeling  them onto a spool. Before spooling, the ﬁ  bers are coated with various chemicals  to lubricate and protect them. Drawing speeds of around  $50\;\mathrm{m/s}$   $(10{,}000\;\mathrm{ft/min})$ ) or  more are not unusual.  

#  Heat Treatment and Finishing  

Heat treatment of the glass product is the third step in the glassworking sequence.  For some products, additional ﬁ  nishing operations are performed.  

# 12.3.1  HEAT TREATMENT  

Glass-ceramics were discussed in Section 7.4.3. This unique material is made by a  special heat treatment that transforms most of the vitreous state into a polycrys- talline ceramic. Other heat treatments performed on glass cause changes that are  less dramatic technologically but perhaps more important commercially; examples  include annealing and tempering.  

Annealing  Glass products usually have undesirable internal stresses after form- ing, which reduce their strength. Annealing is done to relieve these stresses; the  treatment therefore has the same function in glassworking as it does in metalwork- ing.  Annealing  involves heating the glass to an elevated temperature and holding  it for a certain period to eliminate stresses and temperature gradients, then slowly  cooling the glass to suppress stress formation, followed by more rapid cooling to  room temperature. Common annealing temperatures are around $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\left(900^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\right)$ . The  length of time the product is held at the temperature, as well as the heating and cool- ing rates during the cycle, depend on thickness of the glass, the usual rule being that  the required annealing time varies with the square of thickness.  

Annealing in modern glass factories is performed in tunnel-like furnaces, called  lehrs , in which the products ﬂ  ow slowly through the hot chamber on conveyors.  Burners are located only at the front end of the chamber, so that the glass experi- ences the required heating and cooling cycle.  

Tempered Glass and Related Products  A beneﬁ  cial internal stress pattern can be  developed in glass products by a heat treatment known as  tempering , and the result- ing material is called  tempered glass . As in the treatment of hardened steel, tempering  increases the toughness of glass. The process involves heating the glass to a tempera- ture somewhat above its annealing temperature and into the plastic range, followed by  quenching of the surfaces, usually with air jets. When the surfaces cool, they contract  and harden while the interior is still plastic and compliant. As the internal glass slowly  cools, it contracts, thus putting the hard surfaces in compression. Like other ceramics,  glass is much stronger when subjected to compressive stresses than tensile stresses. Ac- cordingly, tempered glass is much more resistant to scratching and breaking because  of the compressive stresses on its surfaces. Applications include windows for tall build- ings, all-glass doors, safety glasses, and other products requiring toughened glass.  

When tempered glass fails, it does so by shattering into numerous small frag- ments that are less likely to cut someone than conventional (annealed) window  glass.   Interestingly, automobile windshields are not made of tempered glass, because  

of the danger posed to the driver by this fragmentation. Instead, conventional glass  is used; however, it is fabricated by sandwiching two pieces of glass on either side of  a tough polymer sheet. Should this  laminated glass  fracture, the glass splinters are  retained by the polymer sheet and the windshield remains relatively transparent.  

# 12.3.2  FINISHING  

Finishing operations are sometimes required for glassware products. These sec- ondary operations include grinding, polishing, and cutting. Reheating is sometimes required between blowing steps. Duplicate and triplicate  molds are sometimes used along with matching gob feeders to increase production  rates. Press-and-blow and blow-and-blow methods are used to make jars, beverage  bottles, incandescent light bulb enclosures, and similar geometries.

# 12.3.2  FINISHING  

Finishing operations are sometimes required for glassware products. These sec- ondary operations include grinding, polishing, and cutting. When glass sheets are  produced by drawing and rolling, the opposite sides are not necessarily parallel, and  the surfaces contain defects and scratch marks caused by the use of hard tooling on  soft glass. The glass sheets must be ground and polished for most commercial ap- plications. In pressing and blowing operations when split dies are used, polishing is  often required to remove the seam marks from the container product.  

In continuous glassworking processes, such as plate and tube production, the con- tinuous sections must be cut into smaller pieces. This is accomplished by ﬁ  rst scoring  the glass with a glass-cutting wheel or cutting diamond and then breaking the section  along the score line. Cutting is generally done as the glass exits the annealing lehr.  

Decorative and surface processes are performed on certain glassware products.  These processes include mechanical cutting and polishing operations; sandblasting;  chemical etching (with hydroﬂ  uoric acid, often in combination with other chemi- cals); and coating (for example, coating of plate glass with aluminum or silver to  produce mirrors).  

# 12.4 12.4  Product Design Considerations  

Glass possesses special properties that make it desirable in certain applications. The  following design recommendations are compiled from Bralla [1] and other sources.  

$\gg$ Glass is transparent and has certain optical properties that are unusual if not  unique among engineering materials. For applications requiring transparency,  light transmittance, magniﬁ  cation, and similar optical properties, glass is likely  to be the material of choice. Certain polymers are transparent and may be com- petitive, depending on design requirements.

 $\gg$   Glass is several times stronger in compression than in tension; components  should be designed so that they are subjected to compressive stresses, not ten- sile stresses.

 $\gg$ Ceramics, including glass, are brittle. Glass parts should not be used in applica- tions that involve impact loading or high stresses which might cause fracture.

 $\gg$ Certain glass compositions have very low thermal expansion coefﬁ  cients and  are therefore tolerant of thermal shock. These glasses can be selected for appli- cations in which this characteristic is important (e.g., cookware).

 $\gg$ Outside edges and corners on glass parts should have large radii or chamfers;  likewise, inside corners should have large radii. Both outside and inside corners  are potential points of stress concentration.

 $\gg$ Unlike parts made of traditional and new ceramics, threads may be included in  the design of glass parts; they are technically feasible with the press-and-blow  shaping processes. However, the threads should be coarse.

Describe how a piece of glass is heat treated to produce tempered glass.,"Answer. The glass is heated to a temperature above the annealing temperature and the surfaces are then quenched by air jets to cool and harden them while the interior of the piece remains plastic; as the interior cools and contracts, it puts the previously hardened surfaces in compression, which strengthens it.","To produce tempered glass, a specific heat treatment process is followed:

1. **Heating**: The glass is heated to a temperature above its annealing point but below its softening point, typically in the range of 600°C to 650°C. This temperature is sufficient to make the glass pliable without melting.

2. **Rapid Cooling (Quenching)**: The heated glass is then rapidly cooled using a process called quenching. This is often done by blasting both surfaces of the glass with high-pressure air jets. The rapid cooling causes the external surfaces of the glass to solidify first and contract, while the inner layers remain warmer and more flexible.

3. **Internal Stress Development**: As the inner layers eventually cool and contract, they pull inward against the already solidified layers, creating a state of compression on the surface and tension within the interior. This imparted stress pattern enhances the strength of the glass.

The resultant tempered glass is stronger and more resistant to impact and thermal stress compared to annealed glass. If broken, it shatters into small, blunt pieces, reducing the risk of injury.","Drawing of Continuous Filaments  In this process, illustrated in Figure 12.9,  continuous glass ﬁ  bers of small diameter (lower size limit is around  $0.0025~\mathrm{mm}$  or  0.0001 in) are produced by drawing strands of molten glass through small oriﬁ  ces in

12.4 Product Design Considerations  

Glass products are commercially manufactured in an  almost unlimited variety of shapes. Many are produced  in very large quantities, such as light bulbs, beverage  bottles, and window glass. Others, such as giant tele- scope lenses, are made individually.  

Glass is one of three basic types of ceramics (Chap- ter 7). It is distinguished by its noncrystalline (vitreous)  structure, whereas the other ceramic materials have  a crystalline structure. The methods by which glass is  shaped into useful products are quite different from  those used for the other types. In glassworking, the  principal starting material is silica  $(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ ; this is usually  combined with other oxide ceramics that form glasses.  The starting material is heated to transform it from a  hard solid into a viscous liquid; it is then shaped into  the desired geometry while in this highly plastic or ﬂ  uid  condition. When cooled and hard, the material remains  in the glassy state rather than crystallizing.  

The typical manufacturing sequence in glassworking  consists of the steps pictured in Figure 12.1. Shaping is  accomplished by various processes, including casting,  pressing-and-blowing (to produce bottles and other  containers), and rolling (to make plate glass). A ﬁ  nish- ing step is required for certain products.

# Raw Materials  Preparation and  Melting  

The main component in nearly all glasses is silica, the  primary source of which is natural quartz in sand. The  sand must be washed and classiﬁ  ed. Washing removes  impurities such as clay and certain minerals that would  cause undesirable coloring of the glass.  Classifying  the  sand means grouping the grains according to size. The  most desirable particle size for glassmaking is in the  range of 0.1 to $0.6\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.004–0.025 in) [3]. The various  other components, such as soda ash (source of  $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{l}$ ),  limestone (source of  $\mathrm{CaO}$ ), aluminum oxide, potash

(source of  $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ ), and other minerals are added in the proper proportions to achieve  the desired composition. The mixing is usually done in batches, in amounts that are  compatible with the capacities of available melting furnaces.  

Recycled glass is usually added to the mixture in modern practice. In addition  to preserving the environment, recycled glass facilitates melting. Depending on the  amount of waste glass available and the speciﬁ  cations of the ﬁ  nal composition, the  proportion of recycled glass may be up to $100\%$ .  

The batch of starting materials to be melted is referred to as a  charge , and the pro- cedure of loading it into the melting furnace is called  charging  the furnace. Glass- melting furnaces can be divided into the following types [3]: (1)  pot furnaces —  ceramic pots of limited capacity in which melting occurs by heating the walls of the  pot; (2)  day tanks —larger capacity vessels for batch production in which heating is  done by burning fuels above the charge; (3)  continuous tank furnaces —long tank  furnaces in which raw materials are fed in one end, and melted as they move to the  other end where molten glass is drawn out for high production; and (4)  electric fur- naces  of various designs for a wide range of production rates.

Describe the type of material that is commonly used to make windshields for automobiles.,"Answer. Laminated glass, in which two sheets of glass are laminated on either side of a polymer sheet. This has good impact resistance and does not splinter when broken.","Automobile windshields are commonly made from laminated glass. This type of glass is produced by sandwiching a tough polymer sheet, typically polyvinyl butyral (PVB), between two layers of annealed glass. The lamination process ensures that if the glass fractures, the polymer sheet holds the splinters in place, maintaining a level of transparency and significantly reducing the risk of injury due to flying glass shards.

The choice of laminated glass over tempered glass for windshields is primarily due to safety considerations. Tempered glass, while strong, shatters into small fragments upon impact, which can pose a danger to vehicle occupants. In contrast, laminated glass combines the safety features of impact resistance and retention of shards, making it the preferred material for windshields where protecting the driver and passengers is crucial.","Applications include windows for tall build- ings, all-glass doors, safety glasses, and other products requiring toughened glass.  

When tempered glass fails, it does so by shattering into numerous small frag- ments that are less likely to cut someone than conventional (annealed) window  glass.   Interestingly, automobile windshields are not made of tempered glass, because  

of the danger posed to the driver by this fragmentation. Instead, conventional glass  is used; however, it is fabricated by sandwiching two pieces of glass on either side of  a tough polymer sheet. Should this  laminated glass  fracture, the glass splinters are  retained by the polymer sheet and the windshield remains relatively transparent.  

# 12.3.2  FINISHING  

Finishing operations are sometimes required for glassware products. These sec- ondary operations include grinding, polishing, and cutting. When glass sheets are  produced by drawing and rolling, the opposite sides are not necessarily parallel, and  the surfaces contain defects and scratch marks caused by the use of hard tooling on  soft glass. The glass sheets must be ground and polished for most commercial ap- plications. In pressing and blowing operations when split dies are used, polishing is  often required to remove the seam marks from the container product.  

In continuous glassworking processes, such as plate and tube production, the con- tinuous sections must be cut into smaller pieces. This is accomplished by ﬁ  rst scoring  the glass with a glass-cutting wheel or cutting diamond and then breaking the section  along the score line. Cutting is generally done as the glass exits the annealing lehr.  

Decorative and surface processes are performed on certain glassware products.  These processes include mechanical cutting and polishing operations; sandblasting;  chemical etching (with hydroﬂ  uoric acid, often in combination with other chemi- cals); and coating (for example, coating of plate glass with aluminum or silver to  produce mirrors).  

# 12.4 12.4  Product Design Considerations  

Glass possesses special properties that make it desirable in certain applications. The  following design recommendations are compiled from Bralla [1] and other sources.  

$\gg$ Glass is transparent and has certain optical properties that are unusual if not  unique among engineering materials. For applications requiring transparency,  light transmittance, magniﬁ  cation, and similar optical properties, glass is likely  to be the material of choice. Certain polymers are transparent and may be com- petitive, depending on design requirements.

 $\gg$   Glass is several times stronger in compression than in tension; components  should be designed so that they are subjected to compressive stresses, not ten- sile stresses.

 $\gg$ Ceramics, including glass, are brittle. Glass parts should not be used in applica- tions that involve impact loading or high stresses which might cause fracture.

 $\gg$ Certain glass compositions have very low thermal expansion coefﬁ  cients and  are therefore tolerant of thermal shock. These glasses can be selected for appli- cations in which this characteristic is important (e.g., cookware).

 $\gg$ Outside edges and corners on glass parts should have large radii or chamfers;  likewise, inside corners should have large radii. Both outside and inside corners  are potential points of stress concentration.

 $\gg$ Unlike parts made of traditional and new ceramics, threads may be included in  the design of glass parts; they are technically feasible with the press-and-blow  shaping processes. However, the threads should be coarse. Another glass fiber material is S- glass, which has higher strength but is not as economical as E-glass. Compositions are  indicated in the table.  

Insulating fiberglass wool can be manufactured from regular soda-lime-silica  glasses. The glass product for fiber optics consists of a long, continuous core of glass  with high refractive index surrounded by a sheath of lower refractive glass. The in-  side glass must have a very high transmittance for light in order to accomplish long  distance communication.  

Optical Glasses  Applications for these glasses include lenses for eyeglasses and  optical instruments such as cameras, microscopes, and telescopes. To achieve their  function, the glasses must have different refractive indices, but each lens must be  homogenous in composition. Optical glasses are generally divided into: crowns and  flints.  Crown glass  has a low index of refraction, while  flint glass  contains lead oxide  (PbO) that gives it a high index of refraction.  

# 7.4.3  GLASS- CERAMICS  

Glass-ceramics are a class of ceramic material produced by conversion of glass into   a  polycrystalline structure through heat treatment. The proportion of crystalline phase  in the final product typically ranges between $90\%$  and $98\%$ , with the remain- der being  unconverted vitreous material. Grain size is usually between 0.1 and  $1.0\ m\mathrm{m}$  (4 and 40  $m$ -in), significantly smaller than the grain size of conventional ceramics. This fine  crystal microstructure makes glass-ceramics much stronger than the glasses from  which they are derived. Also, due to their crystal structure, glass-ceramics are opaque  (usually gray or white) rather than clear.  

The processing sequence for glass-ceramics is as follows: (1) The first step in-  volves heating and forming operations used in glassworking (Section 12.2) to create  the desired product geometry. Glass shaping methods are generally more economi- cal  than pressing and sintering to shape traditional and new ceramics made from powders.  (2) The product is cooled. (3) The glass is reheated to a temperature suf- ficient to cause  a dense network of crystal nuclei to form throughout the material. It is the high density  of nucleation sites that inhibits grain growth of individual crystals, thus leading  ultimately to the fine grain size in the glass-ceramic material. The key to the propensity  for nucleation is the presence of small amounts of nucleating agents in the glass  composition. Common nucleating agents are  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ ,  $\mathrm{P}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{5}$ , and  $\mathrm{ZrO}_{2}$ . (4) Once  nucleation is initiated, the heat treatment is continued at a higher temperature to cause  growth of the crystalline phases.  

Several examples of glass-ceramic systems and typical compositions are listed  in Table 7.5. The  $\mathrm{Li}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{-}\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\mathrm{-}\mathrm{SiO}$ 2  system is the most important commercially; it  includes Corning Ware (Pyroceram), the familiar product of the Corning Glass Works.

The significant advantages of glass-ceramics include (1) efficiency of processing  in the glassy state, (2) close dimensional control over the final product shape, and (3)  good  mechanical and physical properties.

# 7.4.1 CHEMISTRY AND PROPERTIES OF GLASS  

The principal ingredient in virtually all glasses is  silica  $(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ ), most commonly found  as the mineral quartz in sandstone and silica sand. Quartz occurs naturally as a crys-  talline substance; but when melted and then cooled, it forms vitreous silica. Silica glass  has a very low thermal expansion coefficient and is therefore quite resistant to  thermal shock. These properties are ideal for elevated temperature applications;  accordingly, Pyrex and chemical glassware designed for heating are made with high  proportions of silica glass.  

In order to reduce the melting point of glass for easier processing, and to con-  trol properties, the composition of most commercial glasses includes other oxides  as well as silica. Silica remains as the main component in these glass products, usu-  ally comprising  $50\%$  to  $75\%$  of total chemistry. The reason  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  is used so widely  in these compositions is because it is the best  glass former . It naturally transforms into  a glassy state upon cooling from the liquid, whereas most ceramics crystallize upon  solidification. Table 7.4 lists typical chemistries for some common glasses. The  additional ingredients are contained in a solid solution with  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ , and each has a  function: (1) acting as flux (promoting fusion) during heating; (2) increasing fluidity  in the molten glass for processing; (3) retarding  devitrification —the tendency to  crystallize from the glassy state; (4) reducing thermal expansion in the final product;   (5) improving the chemical resistance against attack by acids, basic substances, or  water; (6) adding color to the glass; and (7) altering the index of refraction for opti-  cal applications (e.g., lenses).  

# 7.4.2  GLASS  PRODUCTS  

Following is a list of the major categories of glass products. The roles played by the  different ingredients are examined in Table 7.4 as these products are discussed.  

Window Glass  This glass is represented by two chemistries in Table 7.4: (1) soda-  lime glass and (2) window glass. The soda-lime formula dates back to the glass-blow-  ing industry of the 1800s and earlier. It was (and is) made by mixing soda  $\mathrm{(Na_{2}O)}$  and  lime (CaO) with silica $\left(\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\right)$  as the major ingredient. The blending of ingredients has  evolved empirically to achieve a balance between avoiding crystallization during

What are some of the design recommendations for glass parts?,"Answer. The guidelines are: (1) subject ceramic parts to compressive, not tensile loads; (2) ceramics are brittle, so avoid impact loading; (3) use large radii on inside and outside corners; (4) screw threads should be course.","Glass parts have unique properties and design considerations. Here are some key recommendations:

1. **Compression Over Tension**: Glass is much stronger in compression than tension. Design glass components to be subjected to compressive stresses to enhance their strength and durability.

2. **Brittleness**: Glass is inherently brittle. Avoid using glass in applications involving high impact or stress that could lead to fracture.

3. **Thermal Shock Resistance**: Some glass compositions have low thermal expansion coefficients, making them suitable for applications needing thermal shock resistance, such as cookware.

4. **Stress Concentration**: Use large radii or chamfers on outside edges and corners, and also on inside corners. This design minimizes points of stress concentration that can lead to cracking or breaking.

5. **Thread Design**: Threads can be incorporated into glass parts using press-and-blow processes, but they should be coarse to ensure durability.

By following these recommendations, designers can effectively utilize glass's unique properties while minimizing potential weaknesses.","Applications include windows for tall build- ings, all-glass doors, safety glasses, and other products requiring toughened glass.  

When tempered glass fails, it does so by shattering into numerous small frag- ments that are less likely to cut someone than conventional (annealed) window  glass.   Interestingly, automobile windshields are not made of tempered glass, because

Chip packaging (Section 33.6) is  only part of the total electronic package. This chapter  considers the remaining levels of packaging and how  the packages are manufactured and assembled.  

# Electronics  Packaging  

The electronics package is the physical means by which  the components in a system are electrically inter- connected and interfaced to external devices; it includes  the mechanical structure that holds and protects the  circuitry. A well-designed electronics package serves  the following functions: (1) power distribution and sig- nal interconnection, (2) structural support, (3) circuit  protection from physical and chemical hazards in the  environment, (4) dissipation of heat generated by the  circuits, and (5) minimum delays in signal transmission  within the system.  

For complex systems containing many components  and interconnections, the electronics package is organ- ized into levels that comprise a  packaging hierarchy ,  illus  trated in Figure 34.1 and summarized in Table 34.1.  The lowest level is the  zero level , which refers to the  intra connections on the semiconductor chip. The pack- aged chip (chip carrier), consisting of the IC in a plas- tic or ceramic enclosure and connected to the package  leads, constitutes the  ﬁ  rst level of packaging .  

Packaged chips and other components are assembled  to a printed circuit board (PCB) using two technologies  (Section 33.6.1): (1)  surface-mount technology  (SMT)

and (2)  through-hole technology , also known as  pin-in-hole  (PIH) technology. Today,  SMT is much more widely used in industry, especially for mass-produced products.  The chip package styles and assembly techniques are different for SMT and PIH. In  many cases, both assembly technologies are employed in the same board. Printed cir- cuit board assembly represents the  second level of packaging . Figure 34.2 shows two  PCB assemblies, illustrating both PIH and SMT types. Note the smaller component  sizes of the SMT board.

The assembled PCBs are, in turn, connected to a chassis or other framework; this  is the  third level of packaging . This third level may consist of a  rack  that holds the  boards, using wire cables to make the interconnections. In major electronic systems,  such as large computers, the PCBs are typically mounted onto a larger printed cir- cuit board called a  back plane , which has conduction paths to permit interconnec- tion between the smaller boards attached to it. #  IC Packaging  

After all of the processing steps on the wafer have been completed, a ﬁ  nal series of  operations must be accomplished to transform the wafer into individual chips, ready  to connect to external circuits and prepared to withstand the harsh environment of  the world outside the clean room. These ﬁ  nal steps are referred to as IC packaging.  

Packaging of integrated circuits is concerned with design issues such as (1) electrical  connections to external circuits; (2) materials to encase the chip and protect it from the  environment (humidity, corrosion, temperature, vibration, mechanical shock); (3) heat  dissipation; (4) performance, reliability, and service life; and (5) cost.  

There are also manufacturing issues in packaging, including: (1) chip separation— cutting the wafer into individual chips, (2) connecting it to the package, (3) encapsulat- ing the chip, and (4) circuit testing. The manufacturing issues are the ones of greatest  interest in this section. Although most of the design issues are properly left to other  texts [8], [11], [13], and [15], some of the engineering aspects of IC packages, also known  as  chip carriers , and the types of packages are discussed here, before describing the  processing steps to make them.  

# 33.6.1  IC PACKAGE DESIGN  

This section considers three topics related to the design of an integrated circuit  package: (1) the number of input/output terminals required for an IC of a given size,  (2) the materials used in IC packages, and (3) package styles.  

Determining the Number of Input/Output Terminals   The basic engineering  problem in IC packaging is to connect the many internal circuits to input/output  (I/O) terminals so that the appropriate electrical signals can be communicated

between the IC and the outside world. As the number of devices in an IC in- creases, the required number of I/O terminals (leads) also increases. The problem  is of course aggravated by trends in semiconductor technology that have led to  decreases in device size and increases in the number of devices that can be packed  into an IC. Fortunately, the number of I/O terminals does not have to equal the  number of devices in the IC. The dependency between the two values is given by  Rent’s rule, named after the IBM engineer (E. F. Rent) who deﬁ  ned the following  relationship around 1960:  

$$
n_{i o}=C\,n_{i c}{}^{m}
$$  

where $n_{i o}=$  the required number of input/output terminals or external signal connec- tions; $n_{i c}=$  the number of internal circuits in the IC, usually taken to be the number  of logic gates; and  $C$  and $m$  are parameters in the equation.  

The parameters in Rent’s rule depend on the type of circuit and the design of the  IC. Memory devices require far fewer  $\mathrm{I}/\mathrm{O}$  terminals than microprocessors due to  their column and row structures. Typical values of the Constant  $C$  and exponent $m$ for several common integrated circuit devices are listed in Table 33.4.  

# Example 33.2  Rent’s rule  

The $18{\mathrm{-mm}}$  square chips from Example 33.1 have a processable area of $17\,\mathrm{mm}$   by $17\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The density of circuits (e.g., transistors) within each chip’s processable  area is 500 circuits per $\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ . Determine (a) the number of circuits (transistors)  that can be placed on each chip and (b) the number of input/output terminals  that would be required in the packaged microprocessor using Rent’s rule.  (c) If the packaged IC were a static random access memory devise instead of a  microprocessor, how many input/output terminals would be required? However, as a practical matter, the center area of the package has  no terminals because this region contains the IC chip.  

# 33.6.2  PROCESSING STEPS IN IC PACKAGING  

The packaging of an IC chip in manufacturing can be divided into the following  steps: (1) wafer testing, (2) chip separation, (3) die bonding, (4) wire bonding, and  (5) package sealing. After packaging, a ﬁ  nal functional test is performed on each  packaged IC.  

Wafer Testing   Current semiconductor processing techniques provide many  indivi  dual ICs per wafer. It is convenient to perform certain functional tests on  the ICs while they are still together on the wafer—before chip separation. Testing  is accomplished by computer-controlled test equipment that uses a set of needle  probes conﬁ  gured to match the connecting pads on the surface of the chip;  multi- probe  is the term used for this testing procedure. When the probes contact the pads,  a series of DC tests are carried out to indicate short circuits and other faults; this is  followed by a functional test of the IC. Chips that fail the test are marked with an  ink dot; these defects are not packaged. Each IC is positioned in its turn beneath  the probes for testing, using a high precision $x$ - y  table to index the wafer from one  chip site to the next.  

Chip Separation  The next step after testing is to cut the wafer into individual  chips (dice). A thin diamond-impregnated saw blade is used to perform the cut- ting operation. The sawing machine is highly automatic and its alignment with the  “streets” between circuits is very accurate. The wafer is attached to a piece of adhe- sive tape that is mounted in a frame. The adhesive tape holds the individual chips in  place during and after sawing; the frame is a convenience in subsequent handling of  the chips. Chips with ink dots are now discarded.  

Die Bonding   The individual chips must next be attached to their individual pack- ages, a procedure called die bonding. Owing to the miniature size of the chips, auto- mated handling systems are used to pick the separated chips from the tape frame and  place them for die bonding.  Various techniques have been developed to bond the chip  to the packaging substrate; two methods are described here: eutectic die bonding  and epoxy die bonding.  Eutectic die bonding , used for ceramic packages, consists of  (1) depositing a thin ﬁ  lm of gold on the bottom surface of the chip; (2) heating the  base of the ceramic package to a temperature above $370^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(\sim\!700^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ , the eutectic  temperature of the Au—Si system; and (3) bonding the chip to the metallization  pattern on the heated base. In  epoxy die bonding , used for plastic VLSI packaging,  a small amount of epoxy is dispensed on the package base (the lead frame), and  the chip is positioned on the epoxy; the epoxy is then cured, bonding the chip to  the surface.  

Wire Bonding   After the die is bonded to the package, electrical connections are  made between the contact pads on the chip surface and the package leads. The  connections are generally made using small-diameter wires of aluminum or gold,  as illustrated in Figure 33.22. Typical wire diameters for aluminum are  $0.05\ \mathrm{mm}$   (0.002 in), and gold wire diameters are about half that diameter (Au has higher

electrical conductivity than Al, but is more expensive). Aluminum wires are bonded  by ultrasonic bonding, whereas gold wires are bonded by thermo compression,  thermosonic, or ultrasonic means.  Ultrasonic bonding  uses ultrasonic energy to  weld the wire to the pad surface.  Thermo  compression bonding  involves heating  the end of the wire to form a molten ball, and then the ball is pressed into the pad  to form the bond.  Thermosonic bonding  combines ultrasonic and thermal energies  to form the bond.

Identify the levels of packaging hierarchy in electronics.,"Answer. The levels are: (0) chip intraconnections, (1) chip to package, (2) component to PCB, (3) PCB to rack or chassis, and (4) wiring and cabling inside a cabinet.","The levels of packaging hierarchy in electronics are as follows:

1. **Level 0**: Intra-connections on the semiconductor chip.
   - This level involves the connections within the IC itself, such as the interconnections of transistors and other devices on the chip die.

2. **Level 1**: Chip-to-package interconnections.
   - Here, the IC is encapsulated in a package (chip carrier) and connected to the package leads. It involves methods like wire bonding or flip-chip technology.

3. **Level 2**: IC package to circuit board interconnections.
   - At this level, packaged chips and other components are mounted and connected onto a printed circuit board (PCB). This can involve surface-mount technology (SMT) or through-hole technology.

4. **Level 3**: Circuit board to rack or card-on-board packaging.
   - This involves connecting assembled PCBs to a larger framework, often using racks or backplanes which interconnect multiple boards and allow for signal distribution among them.

5. **Level 4**: Wiring and cabling within a cabinet.
   - The highest level, involving the cabling and connections required to link the packaging system within an electronic device or system enclosure, which might include entire computer systems, telecommunications equipment, etc.

Each level serves the purpose of functional integration and connectivity from the micro scale on chips up through larger system architectures.","# Electronics  Assembly and  Packaging

This latter conﬁ  guration is known as  card-on-board  (COB) packaging, in which the smaller PCBs are called cards and  the back plane is the board.  

The  fourth level of packaging  consists of wiring and cabling inside the cabinet  that contains the electronic system. For systems of relatively low complexity, the  packaging may not include all of the possible levels in the hierarchy.  

A printed circuit board consists of one or more thin sheets of insulating material,  with thin copper lines on one or both surfaces that interconnect the components  attached to the board. In boards consisting of more than one layer, copper conduct- ing paths are interleaved between the layers. PCBs are used in packaged electronic  systems to hold components, provide electrical interconnections among them, and  make connections to external circuits. They have become standard building blocks  in virtually all electronic systems that contain packaged ICs and other components  (Historical Note 34.1). PCBs are so important and widely used because (1) they  provide a convenient structural platform for the components; (2) a board with cor- rectly routed interconnections can be mass produced consistently, without the varia- bility usually associated with hand wiring; (3) nearly all of the soldering connections  between components and the PCB can be accomplished in a one-step mechanized  

# Historical Note 34.1  Printed circuit boards  

Before printed circuit boards, electrical and electronic  components were manually fastened to a sheet-metal  chassis (usually aluminum) and then hand wired and  soldered to form the desired circuit. This was called  point-to-point construction. In the late 1950s, various  plastic boards became commercially available. These  boards, which provided electrical insulation, gradually  replaced the aluminum chassis.  The ﬁ  rst plastics were  phenolics, followed by glass-ﬁ  ber-reinforced epoxies.  The boards came with predrilled holes spaced at  standard intervals in both directions. This motivated  the use of electronic components that matched these  hole spacings.  The dual-in-line package evolved during  this period.  

The components in these circuit boards were hand- wired, which proved increasingly difﬁ  cult and prone to  human error as component densities increased and cir- cuits became more complex. The printed circuit board,  with etched copper foil on its surface to form the wiring  interconnections, was developed in the 1950s to solve  these problems with manual wiring. The printed circuit  boards during that period used through-hole technology,  and PCBs had to be drilled to accommodate the com- ponent leads. The original technique for “printing” the  circuit pattern onto the copper-clad board was screen  printing. In the late 1980s, surface mount technology  began to replace through-hole construction. SMT did  not require lead holes, and the components were signi- ﬁ  cantly smaller, allowing much higher circuit densities  to be achieved on the printed circuit boards. As track  widths became ﬁ  ner and ﬁ  ner, photolithography was  substituted for screen printing.  

Initial techniques to design the circuit masks involved  a manual inking procedure, in which the designer at- tempted to route the conducting tracks to provide the  required connections and avoid short circuits on a large  sheet of paper or vellum. This became more difﬁ  cult as  the number of components on the board increased and  the conducting lines interconnecting the components  became ﬁ  ner. Computer programs were developed to  aid the designer in solving the routing problem. How- ever, in many cases, it was impossible to ﬁ  nd a solu- tion with no intersecting tracks (short circuits). To solve  the problem, jumper wires were hand-soldered to the  board to make these connections.

What is the difference between a track and a land on a printed circuit board?,"Answer. A track is a copper conducting path on a PCB, while a land is a small copper area for electrically attaching components.","Tracks and lands are both copper features on a printed circuit board (PCB) but serve different purposes in the design and construction of electronic circuits.

**Tracks:**
- Tracks are thin lines of copper that create pathways on the PCB.
- They are used to route electrical signals between different components.
- Tracks connect the lands where components are mounted, enabling electrical flow across the board.
- The width and length of tracks can vary depending on the current they need to carry and the design requirements.

**Lands:**
- Lands, also known as pads, are larger areas of copper.
- They provide the points of attachment for the component leads or terminals.
- Lands are designed to be the contact points where components, such as resistors, capacitors, or integrated circuits, are soldered onto the board.
- They need to be wide enough to ensure effective soldering and mechanical support for the components.

In summary, tracks are the conductive pathways that interconnect components, while lands are the connection points for mounting components on the PCB.","As track  widths became ﬁ  ner and ﬁ  ner, photolithography was  substituted for screen printing.

# 34.2.1  STRUCTURES, TYPES, AND MATERIALS FOR PCBs  

A  printed circuit board  (PCB), also called a  printed wiring board  (PWB), is a  laminated ﬂ  at panel of insulating material designed to provide electrical intercon- nections between electronic components attached to it. Interconnections are made  by thin conducting paths on the surface of the board or in alternating layers sand- wiched between layers of insulating material. The conducting paths are made of  copper and are called  tracks . Other copper areas, called  lands , are also available  on the board surface for attaching and electrically connecting components.  

Insulation materials in PCBs are usually polymer composites reinforced with  glass fabrics or paper. Polymers include epoxy (most widely used), phenolic, and  polyimide. E-glass is the usual ﬁ  ber in glass-reinforcing fabrics, especially in epoxy  PCBs; cotton paper is a common reinforcing layer for phenolic boards. The usual  thickness of the substrate layer is 0.8 to  $3.2~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.031–0.125 in), and copper foil  thickness is around  $0.04~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.0015 in). The materials forming the PCB structure  must be electrically insulating, strong and rigid, resistant to warpage, dimensionally

stable, heat resistant, and ﬂ  ame retardant. Chemicals are often added to the polymer  composite to obtain the last two characteristics.  

There are three principal types of printed circuit board, shown in Figure 34.3:  (a)  single-sided  board, in which copper foil is only on one side of the insulation  substrate; (b)  double-sided  board, in which the copper foil is on both sides of the  substrate; and (c)  multilayer  board, consisting of alternating layers of conducting  foil and insulation. In all three structures, the insulation layers are constructed of  multiple laminates of epoxy-glass sheets (or other composite) bonded together to  form a strong and rigid structure. Multilayer boards are used for complex circuit  assemblies in which a large number of components must be interconnected with  many track routings, thus requiring more conducting paths than can be accommo- dated in one or two copper layers. Four layers is the most common multilayer con- ﬁ  guration, but boards with up to 24 conducting layers are produced.  

# 34.2.2  PRODUCTION OF THE STARTING BOARDS  

Single- and double-sided boards can be purchased from suppliers that specialize  in mass producing them in standard sizes. The boards are then custom-processed  by a circuit fabricator to create the speciﬁ  ed circuit pattern and board size for  a given application. Multilayer boards are fabricated from standard single- and  double-sided boards. Upper PCB  assembly is through- hole technology  (pin-in-hole) whereas  lower assembly is  mostly surface-mount  technology. (Courtesy  of George E. Kane  Manufacturing  Technology Laboratory,  Lehigh University.)  

The assembled PCBs are, in turn, connected to a chassis or other framework; this  is the  third level of packaging . This third level may consist of a  rack  that holds the  boards, using wire cables to make the interconnections. In major electronic systems,  such as large computers, the PCBs are typically mounted onto a larger printed cir- cuit board called a  back plane , which has conduction paths to permit interconnec- tion between the smaller boards attached to it. This latter conﬁ  guration is known as  card-on-board  (COB) packaging, in which the smaller PCBs are called cards and  the back plane is the board.  

The  fourth level of packaging  consists of wiring and cabling inside the cabinet  that contains the electronic system. For systems of relatively low complexity, the  packaging may not include all of the possible levels in the hierarchy.  

A printed circuit board consists of one or more thin sheets of insulating material,  with thin copper lines on one or both surfaces that interconnect the components  attached to the board. In boards consisting of more than one layer, copper conduct- ing paths are interleaved between the layers. PCBs are used in packaged electronic  systems to hold components, provide electrical interconnections among them, and  make connections to external circuits. They have become standard building blocks  in virtually all electronic systems that contain packaged ICs and other components  (Historical Note 34.1). PCBs are so important and widely used because (1) they  provide a convenient structural platform for the components; (2) a board with cor- rectly routed interconnections can be mass produced consistently, without the varia- bility usually associated with hand wiring; (3) nearly all of the soldering connections  between components and the PCB can be accomplished in a one-step mechanized  

# Historical Note 34.1  Printed circuit boards  

Before printed circuit boards, electrical and electronic  components were manually fastened to a sheet-metal  chassis (usually aluminum) and then hand wired and  soldered to form the desired circuit. This was called  point-to-point construction. In the late 1950s, various  plastic boards became commercially available. These  boards, which provided electrical insulation, gradually  replaced the aluminum chassis.  The ﬁ  rst plastics were  phenolics, followed by glass-ﬁ  ber-reinforced epoxies.  The boards came with predrilled holes spaced at  standard intervals in both directions. This motivated  the use of electronic components that matched these  hole spacings.  The dual-in-line package evolved during  this period.  

The components in these circuit boards were hand- wired, which proved increasingly difﬁ  cult and prone to  human error as component densities increased and cir- cuits became more complex. The printed circuit board,  with etched copper foil on its surface to form the wiring  interconnections, was developed in the 1950s to solve  these problems with manual wiring. The printed circuit  boards during that period used through-hole technology,  and PCBs had to be drilled to accommodate the com- ponent leads. The original technique for “printing” the  circuit pattern onto the copper-clad board was screen  printing. In the late 1980s, surface mount technology  began to replace through-hole construction. SMT did  not require lead holes, and the components were signi- ﬁ  cantly smaller, allowing much higher circuit densities  to be achieved on the printed circuit boards. As track  widths became ﬁ  ner and ﬁ  ner, photolithography was  substituted for screen printing.  

Initial techniques to design the circuit masks involved  a manual inking procedure, in which the designer at- tempted to route the conducting tracks to provide the  required connections and avoid short circuits on a large  sheet of paper or vellum. This became more difﬁ  cult as  the number of components on the board increased and  the conducting lines interconnecting the components  became ﬁ  ner. Computer programs were developed to  aid the designer in solving the routing problem. How- ever, in many cases, it was impossible to ﬁ  nd a solu- tion with no intersecting tracks (short circuits). To solve  the problem, jumper wires were hand-soldered to the  board to make these connections. The setup consists of an array  of probes that are forced under light pressure to make contact with speciﬁ  ed points  on the board surface. Electrical connections between contact points can be quickly  checked in this procedure.  

Several additional processing steps must be performed on the bare board to pre- pare it for assembly. The ﬁ  rst of these ﬁ  nishing operations is the application of a thin  solder layer on the track and land surfaces. This layer serves to protect the copper  from oxidation and contamination. It is carried out either by electroplating or by  bringing the copper side into contact with rotating rollers that are partially sub- mersed in molten solder.  

A second operation involves application of a coating of solder resist to all areas of  the board surface except the lands that are to be subsequently soldered in assembly.  The solder resist coating is chemically formulated to resist adhesion of solder; thus,  in the subsequent soldering processes, solder adheres only to land areas. Solder resist  is usually applied by screen printing.  

Finally, an identiﬁ  cation legend is printed onto the surface, again by screen print- ing. The legend indicates where the different components are to be placed on the  board in ﬁ  nal assembly. In modern industrial practice, a bar code is also printed on  the board for production control purposes.  

#  Printed Circuit Board Assembly  

A printed circuit board assembly consists of electronic components (e.g., IC pack- ages, resistors, capacitors) as well as mechanical components (e.g., fasteners, heat  sinks) mounted on a printed circuit board. This is level 2 in electronic packaging  (Table 34.1). As indicated, PCB assembly is based on either surface-mount techno- logy (SMT) or through-hole technology (see Figure 34.2). Some PCB assemblies  include both SMT and through-hole components. The discussion in this section  covers both categories as well as combinations of the two. The scope of electronic  assembly also includes higher packaging levels such as assemblies of multiple  PCBs electrically connected and mechanically contained in a chassis or cabinet.  Section 34.4 explores the technologies by which electrical connections are made at  these higher levels.  

# 34.3.1  SURFACE MOUNT TECHNOLOGY  

Since the late 1980s, the use of surface mount technology has grown to the point  where it is now the dominant process in printed circuit board assembly. The earlier  through-hole technology has the following inherent limitations in terms of packing  density: (1) components can be mounted on only one side of the board, and (2) center- to-center distance between lead pins in leaded components must be a minimum of  $1.0\:\mathrm{mm}\:(0.04\:\mathrm{in})$  and is usually $2.5\,\mathrm{mm}\,(0.10\,\mathrm{in})$ .  

Surface-mount technology uses an assembly method in which component leads  are soldered to lands on the surface of the board rather than into holes running  through the board (Historical Note 34.2). By eliminating the need for leads inserted  into through holes in the board, several advantages are gained: (1) smaller compo- nents are available, with leads closer together; (2) circuit densities can be increased;  (3) components can be mounted on both sides of the board; (4) smaller PCBs can be  used for the same electronic system; and (5) drilling of the many through holes dur- ing board fabrication is eliminated although via holes to interconnect layers are still  required [6]. Typical areas on the board surface taken by SMT components range  between $20\%$  and $60\%$  compared to through-hole components.  

# Historical Note 34.2  Surface-mount technology  

Printed circuit board assemblies based on through- hole technology were the predominant electronics  packaging method from the 1950s through most of the  1980s, when surface-mount technology (SMT) started  to be widely used.  

SMT traces its origins to the electronic systems  in the aerospace and military industries of the 1960s,  with the IBM Corporation responsible for much of  the original development work. The ﬁ  rst components  were small, ﬂ  at ceramic packages with gull-wing  leads. The initial reason why these packages were  attrac  tive, compared with through-hole technology,  was the fact that they could be placed on both sides  of a printed circuit board—in effect, doubling the com- ponent density.

Integrated circuits constitute the brains of an electronic  system, but the complete system consists of much more  than packaged ICs. The ICs and other components are  mounted and interconnected on printed circuit boards,  which in turn are interconnected and contained in a  chassis or cabinet. Chip packaging (Section 33.6) is  only part of the total electronic package. This chapter  considers the remaining levels of packaging and how  the packages are manufactured and assembled.  

# Electronics  Packaging  

The electronics package is the physical means by which  the components in a system are electrically inter- connected and interfaced to external devices; it includes  the mechanical structure that holds and protects the  circuitry. A well-designed electronics package serves  the following functions: (1) power distribution and sig- nal interconnection, (2) structural support, (3) circuit  protection from physical and chemical hazards in the  environment, (4) dissipation of heat generated by the  circuits, and (5) minimum delays in signal transmission  within the system.  

For complex systems containing many components  and interconnections, the electronics package is organ- ized into levels that comprise a  packaging hierarchy ,  illus  trated in Figure 34.1 and summarized in Table 34.1.  The lowest level is the  zero level , which refers to the  intra connections on the semiconductor chip. The pack- aged chip (chip carrier), consisting of the IC in a plas- tic or ceramic enclosure and connected to the package  leads, constitutes the  ﬁ  rst level of packaging .  

Packaged chips and other components are assembled  to a printed circuit board (PCB) using two technologies  (Section 33.6.1): (1)  surface-mount technology  (SMT)  

![](images/1e20e72922781b4cf2ccd18b84212143ea7a904759ad35c3b86dcb235827b20d.jpg)  

and (2)  through-hole technology , also known as  pin-in-hole  (PIH) technology. Today,  SMT is much more widely used in industry, especially for mass-produced products.  The chip package styles and assembly techniques are different for SMT and PIH. In  many cases, both assembly technologies are employed in the same board. Printed cir- cuit board assembly represents the  second level of packaging . Figure 34.2 shows two  PCB assemblies, illustrating both PIH and SMT types. Note the smaller component  sizes of the SMT board.

This third level may consist of a  rack  that holds the  boards, using wire cables to make the interconnections. In major electronic systems,  such as large computers, the PCBs are typically mounted onto a larger printed cir- cuit board called a  back plane , which has conduction paths to permit interconnec- tion between the smaller boards attached to it. This latter conﬁ  guration is known as  card-on-board  (COB) packaging, in which the smaller PCBs are called cards and  the back plane is the board.  

The  fourth level of packaging  consists of wiring and cabling inside the cabinet  that contains the electronic system. For systems of relatively low complexity, the  packaging may not include all of the possible levels in the hierarchy.  

A printed circuit board consists of one or more thin sheets of insulating material,  with thin copper lines on one or both surfaces that interconnect the components  attached to the board. In boards consisting of more than one layer, copper conduct- ing paths are interleaved between the layers. PCBs are used in packaged electronic  systems to hold components, provide electrical interconnections among them, and  make connections to external circuits. They have become standard building blocks  in virtually all electronic systems that contain packaged ICs and other components  (Historical Note 34.1). PCBs are so important and widely used because (1) they  provide a convenient structural platform for the components; (2) a board with cor- rectly routed interconnections can be mass produced consistently, without the varia- bility usually associated with hand wiring; (3) nearly all of the soldering connections  between components and the PCB can be accomplished in a one-step mechanized  

# Historical Note 34.1  Printed circuit boards  

Before printed circuit boards, electrical and electronic  components were manually fastened to a sheet-metal  chassis (usually aluminum) and then hand wired and  soldered to form the desired circuit. This was called  point-to-point construction. In the late 1950s, various  plastic boards became commercially available. These  boards, which provided electrical insulation, gradually  replaced the aluminum chassis.  The ﬁ  rst plastics were  phenolics, followed by glass-ﬁ  ber-reinforced epoxies.  The boards came with predrilled holes spaced at  standard intervals in both directions. This motivated  the use of electronic components that matched these  hole spacings.  The dual-in-line package evolved during  this period.  

The components in these circuit boards were hand- wired, which proved increasingly difﬁ  cult and prone to  human error as component densities increased and cir- cuits became more complex. The printed circuit board,  with etched copper foil on its surface to form the wiring  interconnections, was developed in the 1950s to solve  these problems with manual wiring. The printed circuit  boards during that period used through-hole technology,  and PCBs had to be drilled to accommodate the com- ponent leads. The original technique for “printing” the  circuit pattern onto the copper-clad board was screen  printing. In the late 1980s, surface mount technology  began to replace through-hole construction. SMT did  not require lead holes, and the components were signi- ﬁ  cantly smaller, allowing much higher circuit densities  to be achieved on the printed circuit boards. As track  widths became ﬁ  ner and ﬁ  ner, photolithography was  substituted for screen printing.  

Initial techniques to design the circuit masks involved  a manual inking procedure, in which the designer at- tempted to route the conducting tracks to provide the  required connections and avoid short circuits on a large  sheet of paper or vellum. This became more difﬁ  cult as  the number of components on the board increased and  the conducting lines interconnecting the components  became ﬁ  ner. Computer programs were developed to  aid the designer in solving the routing problem. How- ever, in many cases, it was impossible to ﬁ  nd a solu- tion with no intersecting tracks (short circuits). To solve  the problem, jumper wires were hand-soldered to the  board to make these connections. # Electronics  Assembly and  Packaging

Integrated circuits constitute the brains of an electronic  system, but the complete system consists of much more  than packaged ICs. The ICs and other components are  mounted and interconnected on printed circuit boards,  which in turn are interconnected and contained in a  chassis or cabinet. Chip packaging (Section 33.6) is  only part of the total electronic package. This chapter  considers the remaining levels of packaging and how  the packages are manufactured and assembled.  

# Electronics  Packaging  

The electronics package is the physical means by which  the components in a system are electrically inter- connected and interfaced to external devices; it includes  the mechanical structure that holds and protects the  circuitry. A well-designed electronics package serves  the following functions: (1) power distribution and sig- nal interconnection, (2) structural support, (3) circuit  protection from physical and chemical hazards in the  environment, (4) dissipation of heat generated by the  circuits, and (5) minimum delays in signal transmission  within the system.  

For complex systems containing many components  and interconnections, the electronics package is organ- ized into levels that comprise a  packaging hierarchy ,  illus  trated in Figure 34.1 and summarized in Table 34.1.  The lowest level is the  zero level , which refers to the  intra connections on the semiconductor chip. The pack- aged chip (chip carrier), consisting of the IC in a plas- tic or ceramic enclosure and connected to the package  leads, constitutes the  ﬁ  rst level of packaging .  

Packaged chips and other components are assembled  to a printed circuit board (PCB) using two technologies  (Section 33.6.1): (1)  surface-mount technology  (SMT)  

![](images/1e20e72922781b4cf2ccd18b84212143ea7a904759ad35c3b86dcb235827b20d.jpg)  

and (2)  through-hole technology , also known as  pin-in-hole  (PIH) technology. Today,  SMT is much more widely used in industry, especially for mass-produced products.  The chip package styles and assembly techniques are different for SMT and PIH. In  many cases, both assembly technologies are employed in the same board. Printed cir- cuit board assembly represents the  second level of packaging . Figure 34.2 shows two  PCB assemblies, illustrating both PIH and SMT types. Note the smaller component  sizes of the SMT board.

What is a via hole in a printed circuit board?,Answer. A via hole is a hole in the printed circuit board whose sides are plated with copper to serve as a conducting path from one side of a PCB to the other or between intermediate layers in a multilayer board.,"A via hole in a printed circuit board (PCB) is a small, plated through-hole that allows electrical connection between different layers of the PCB. These holes are filled with conductive material, typically copper, and are used in multilayer PCBs to enable the electrical connection between copper tracks on different layers. 

Via holes come in various types:
1. **Through-hole vias**: These extend from the top to the bottom layer, passing through the entire board.
2. **Blind vias**: These connect an outer layer with one or more inner layers but do not go through the whole board.
3. **Buried vias**: These are located between internal layers and do not reach the outer surfaces.

Vias are essential for achieving high-density interconnections in complex multilayer boards, where space constraints and intricate circuit paths require connections across multiple layers. They play a crucial role in providing reliable and efficient electrical pathways, contributing to the overall miniaturization and functionality of electronic devices.","Upper PCB  assembly is through- hole technology  (pin-in-hole) whereas  lower assembly is  mostly surface-mount  technology.

To solve  the problem, jumper wires were hand-soldered to the  board to make these connections. The setup consists of an array  of probes that are forced under light pressure to make contact with speciﬁ  ed points  on the board surface. Electrical connections between contact points can be quickly  checked in this procedure.  

Several additional processing steps must be performed on the bare board to pre- pare it for assembly. The ﬁ  rst of these ﬁ  nishing operations is the application of a thin  solder layer on the track and land surfaces. This layer serves to protect the copper  from oxidation and contamination. It is carried out either by electroplating or by  bringing the copper side into contact with rotating rollers that are partially sub- mersed in molten solder.  

A second operation involves application of a coating of solder resist to all areas of  the board surface except the lands that are to be subsequently soldered in assembly.  The solder resist coating is chemically formulated to resist adhesion of solder; thus,  in the subsequent soldering processes, solder adheres only to land areas. Solder resist  is usually applied by screen printing.  

Finally, an identiﬁ  cation legend is printed onto the surface, again by screen print- ing. The legend indicates where the different components are to be placed on the  board in ﬁ  nal assembly. In modern industrial practice, a bar code is also printed on  the board for production control purposes.  

#  Printed Circuit Board Assembly  

A printed circuit board assembly consists of electronic components (e.g., IC pack- ages, resistors, capacitors) as well as mechanical components (e.g., fasteners, heat  sinks) mounted on a printed circuit board. This is level 2 in electronic packaging  (Table 34.1). As indicated, PCB assembly is based on either surface-mount techno- logy (SMT) or through-hole technology (see Figure 34.2). Some PCB assemblies  include both SMT and through-hole components. The discussion in this section  covers both categories as well as combinations of the two. The scope of electronic  assembly also includes higher packaging levels such as assemblies of multiple  PCBs electrically connected and mechanically contained in a chassis or cabinet.  Section 34.4 explores the technologies by which electrical connections are made at  these higher levels.  

# 34.3.1  SURFACE MOUNT TECHNOLOGY  

Since the late 1980s, the use of surface mount technology has grown to the point  where it is now the dominant process in printed circuit board assembly. The earlier  through-hole technology has the following inherent limitations in terms of packing  density: (1) components can be mounted on only one side of the board, and (2) center- to-center distance between lead pins in leaded components must be a minimum of  $1.0\:\mathrm{mm}\:(0.04\:\mathrm{in})$  and is usually $2.5\,\mathrm{mm}\,(0.10\,\mathrm{in})$ .  

Surface-mount technology uses an assembly method in which component leads  are soldered to lands on the surface of the board rather than into holes running  through the board (Historical Note 34.2). By eliminating the need for leads inserted  into through holes in the board, several advantages are gained: (1) smaller compo- nents are available, with leads closer together; (2) circuit densities can be increased;  (3) components can be mounted on both sides of the board; (4) smaller PCBs can be  used for the same electronic system; and (5) drilling of the many through holes dur- ing board fabrication is eliminated although via holes to interconnect layers are still  required [6]. Typical areas on the board surface taken by SMT components range  between $20\%$  and $60\%$  compared to through-hole components.  

# Historical Note 34.2  Surface-mount technology  

Printed circuit board assemblies based on through- hole technology were the predominant electronics  packaging method from the 1950s through most of the  1980s, when surface-mount technology (SMT) started  to be widely used.  

SMT traces its origins to the electronic systems  in the aerospace and military industries of the 1960s,  with the IBM Corporation responsible for much of  the original development work. The ﬁ  rst components  were small, ﬂ  at ceramic packages with gull-wing  leads. The initial reason why these packages were  attrac  tive, compared with through-hole technology,  was the fact that they could be placed on both sides  of a printed circuit board—in effect, doubling the com- ponent density. As track  widths became ﬁ  ner and ﬁ  ner, photolithography was  substituted for screen printing.  

Initial techniques to design the circuit masks involved  a manual inking procedure, in which the designer at- tempted to route the conducting tracks to provide the  required connections and avoid short circuits on a large  sheet of paper or vellum. This became more difﬁ  cult as  the number of components on the board increased and  the conducting lines interconnecting the components  became ﬁ  ner. Computer programs were developed to  aid the designer in solving the routing problem. How- ever, in many cases, it was impossible to ﬁ  nd a solu- tion with no intersecting tracks (short circuits). To solve  the problem, jumper wires were hand-soldered to the  board to make these connections. As the number of  jumper wires increased, the problem of human error  again appeared. Multilayer printed circuit boards were  introduced to deal with this routing issue.  

operation, (4) an assembled PCB gives reliable performance; and (5) in complex  electronic systems, each assembled PCB can be detached from the system for service,  repair, or replacement.  

# 34.2.1  STRUCTURES, TYPES, AND MATERIALS FOR PCBs  

A  printed circuit board  (PCB), also called a  printed wiring board  (PWB), is a  laminated ﬂ  at panel of insulating material designed to provide electrical intercon- nections between electronic components attached to it. Interconnections are made  by thin conducting paths on the surface of the board or in alternating layers sand- wiched between layers of insulating material. The conducting paths are made of  copper and are called  tracks . Other copper areas, called  lands , are also available  on the board surface for attaching and electrically connecting components.  

Insulation materials in PCBs are usually polymer composites reinforced with  glass fabrics or paper. Polymers include epoxy (most widely used), phenolic, and  polyimide. E-glass is the usual ﬁ  ber in glass-reinforcing fabrics, especially in epoxy  PCBs; cotton paper is a common reinforcing layer for phenolic boards. The usual  thickness of the substrate layer is 0.8 to  $3.2~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.031–0.125 in), and copper foil  thickness is around  $0.04~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.0015 in). The materials forming the PCB structure  must be electrically insulating, strong and rigid, resistant to warpage, dimensionally

stable, heat resistant, and ﬂ  ame retardant. Chemicals are often added to the polymer  composite to obtain the last two characteristics.  

There are three principal types of printed circuit board, shown in Figure 34.3:  (a)  single-sided  board, in which copper foil is only on one side of the insulation  substrate; (b)  double-sided  board, in which the copper foil is on both sides of the  substrate; and (c)  multilayer  board, consisting of alternating layers of conducting  foil and insulation. In all three structures, the insulation layers are constructed of  multiple laminates of epoxy-glass sheets (or other composite) bonded together to  form a strong and rigid structure. Multilayer boards are used for complex circuit  assemblies in which a large number of components must be interconnected with  many track routings, thus requiring more conducting paths than can be accommo- dated in one or two copper layers. Four layers is the most common multilayer con- ﬁ  guration, but boards with up to 24 conducting layers are produced.  

# 34.2.2  PRODUCTION OF THE STARTING BOARDS  

Single- and double-sided boards can be purchased from suppliers that specialize  in mass producing them in standard sizes. The boards are then custom-processed  by a circuit fabricator to create the speciﬁ  ed circuit pattern and board size for  a given application. Multilayer boards are fabricated from standard single- and  double-sided boards.

What are the two basic resist coating methods for printed circuit boards?,"Answer. The two methods are: (1) screening, such as silk screening, and (2) photolithography.","The two basic resist coating methods for printed circuit boards are:

1. **Spinning**: This method involves placing a metered amount of liquid photoresist onto the center of the wafer or board, which is then spun at high speeds. The centrifugal force spreads the resist evenly across the surface, resulting in a uniform coating. This method is typically used in semiconductor processing and provides a thin, uniform layer that is essential for achieving high resolution in photolithography.

2. **Screen Printing**: This method is commonly used in the application of solder resist and other coatings on PCB surfaces. It involves forcing the resist through a fine mesh screen that has a patterned stencil, directly onto the surface of the board. This method is beneficial for applying thicker coatings and is well-suited for large-scale manufacturing where precision and speed are required.

Both methods are integral to the fabrication of high-quality printed circuit boards, each offering unique advantages depending on the specific requirements of the PCB design.","Two types of photoresists are available: positive and negative. A  positive resist   becomes more soluble in developing solutions after exposure to light. A  negative  resist  becomes less soluble (the polymer cross-links and hardens) when exposed  to light. Figure 33.9 illustrates the operation of both resist types. Negative resists  have better adhesion to  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  and metal surfaces and good etch resistance. However,  positive resists achieve better resolution, which has made it the more widely used  technique as IC feature sizes have become smaller and smaller.  

Exposure Techniques   The resists are exposed through the mask by one of three  exposure techniques: (a) contact printing, (b) proximity printing, and (c) projection  printing, illustrated in Figure 33.10. In  contact printing , the mask is pressed against  the resist coating during exposure. This results in high resolution of the pattern onto  the wafer surface; an important disadvantage is that physical contact with the wafers  gradually wears out the mask. In  proximity printing , the mask is separated from the  resist coating by a distance of 10 to $25\ \mu\mathrm{m}$  (0.0004–0.001 in). This eliminates mask  wear, but resolution of the image is slightly reduced.  Projection printing  involves  the use of a high-quality lens (or mirror) system to project the image through the  

![](images/c7702fcc7c4d207d2af9e5c2f974c975c59e84a7dd8ebba29d5a62517cff7c22.jpg)  
FIGURE 33.10  Optical  lithography exposure  techniques: (a) contact  printing, (b) proximity  printing, and  (c) projection printing.  

mask onto the wafer. This has become the preferred technique because it is non- contact (thus, no mask wear), and the mask pattern can be reduced through optical  projection to obtain high resolution.  

Processing Sequence in Optical lithography  A typical processing sequence  begins with surface of the silicon having just been oxidized to form a thin ﬁ  lm of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   on the wafer. It is desired to remove the  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  ﬁ  lm in certain regions as deﬁ  ned by  the mask pattern. The sequence for a positive resist proceeds as follows, illustrated  in Figure 33.11. (1)  Prepare surface . The wafer is properly cleaned to promote wett- ing and adhesion of the resist. (2)  Apply photoresist . In semiconductor processing,  photoresists are applied by feeding a metered amount of liquid resist onto the center  of the wafer and then spinning the wafer to spread the liquid and achieve a uni- form coating thickness. Desired thickness is around  $1\ \mu\mathrm{m}$  (0.00004 in), which gives  good resolution yet minimizes pinhole defects. (3)  Soft-bake . The purpose of this  

![](images/f69f89972de26676ed43c5d9012a2da83f77c330e2d3aef80fe7c9f3a8a8b613.jpg)

pre-exposure bake is to remove solvents, promote adhesion, and harden the resist.  Typical soft-bake temperatures are around $90^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(190^{\mathrm{o}}\mathrm{F})$  for 10 to $20\,\mathrm{{min}}$ . (4)  Align  mask and expose . The pattern mask is aligned relative to the wafer and the resist  is exposed through the mask by one of the methods described above. Alignment  must be accomplished with very high precision, using optical-mechanical equipment  designed speciﬁ  cally for the purpose. If the wafer has been previously processed by  lithography so that a pattern has already been formed in the wafer, then sub  sequent  masks must be accurately registered relative to the existing pattern. The interconnection is accomplished by means of copper-plated via holes that run  from lands on one surface of the board to lands on the opposite surface, as shown  in Figure 34.4. A typical fabrication sequence for a double-sided board (copper- clad on both sides) uses the semiadditive method. After hole drilling, electroless  plating is used to initially plate the holes, followed by electroplating to increase  plating thickness.  

A  multilayer board  is structurally the most complex of the three types, and this  complexity is reﬂ  ected in its manufacturing sequence. The laminated construction can  be seen in Figure 34.8, which highlights some of the features of a multilayer PCB.  The fabrication steps for the individual layers are basically the same as those used  for single- and double-sided boards. What makes multilayer board fabrication more  complicated is that (1) all of the layers, each with its own circuit design, must ﬁ  rst be  processed; then (2) the layers must be joined together to form one integral board; and  ﬁ  nally (3) the assembled board must itself be put through its own processing sequence.  

A multilayer board consists of  logic layers , which carry electrical signals between  components on the board, and  voltage layers , which are used to distribute power.  Logic layers are generally fabricated from double-sided boards, whereas voltage  layers are usually made from single-sided boards. Thinner insulating substrates  are used for multi  layer boards than for their standalone single- and double-sided  counter  parts, so that a suitable thickness of the ﬁ  nal board can be achieved.  

In the second stage, the individual layers are assembled together. The procedure  starts with copper foil on the bottom outside, and then adds the individual layers,  separating one from the next by one or more sheets of glass fabric impregnated with  partially cured epoxy. After all layers have been sandwiched together, a ﬁ  nal copper  foil is placed on the stack to form the top outer layer. Layers are then bonded into a  single board by heating the assembly under pressure to cure the epoxy. After curing,  any excess resin squeezed out of the sandwich around the edges is trimmed away.  

At the start of the third stage of fabrication, the board consists of multiple layers  bonded together, with copper foil cladded on its outer surfaces. Its construction can  therefore be likened to that of a double-sided board; and its processing is likewise  similar. The sequence consists of drilling additional through-holes, plating the holes  to establish conduction paths between the two exterior copper ﬁ  lms as well as cer- tain internal copper layers, and the use of photolithography and etching to form the  circuit pattern on the outer copper surfaces.  

Testing and Finishing Operations  After a circuit has been fabricated on the  board surface, it must be inspected and tested to ensure that it functions according  to design speciﬁ  cations and contains no quality defects. Two procedures are com- mon: (1) visual inspection and (2) continuity testing. In  visual inspection , the board  is examined visually to detect open and short circuits, errors in drilled hole loca- tions, and other faults that can be observed without applying electrical power to the  board. Visual inspections, performed not only after fabrication but also at various  critical stages during production, are accomplished by human eye or machine vision  (Section 40.6.3).  

Continuity testing  involves the use of contact probes brought simultaneously into  contact with track and land areas on the board surface. The setup consists of an array  of probes that are forced under light pressure to make contact with speciﬁ  ed points  on the board surface. Electrical connections between contact points can be quickly  checked in this procedure.  

Several additional processing steps must be performed on the bare board to pre- pare it for assembly. The ﬁ  rst of these ﬁ  nishing operations is the application of a thin  solder layer on the track and land surfaces. This layer serves to protect the copper  from oxidation and contamination. It is carried out either by electroplating or by  bringing the copper side into contact with rotating rollers that are partially sub- mersed in molten solder.  

A second operation involves application of a coating of solder resist to all areas of  the board surface except the lands that are to be subsequently soldered in assembly. The setup consists of an array  of probes that are forced under light pressure to make contact with speciﬁ  ed points  on the board surface. Electrical connections between contact points can be quickly  checked in this procedure.

A second operation involves application of a coating of solder resist to all areas of  the board surface except the lands that are to be subsequently soldered in assembly.  The solder resist coating is chemically formulated to resist adhesion of solder; thus,  in the subsequent soldering processes, solder adheres only to land areas. Solder resist  is usually applied by screen printing.  

Finally, an identiﬁ  cation legend is printed onto the surface, again by screen print- ing. The legend indicates where the different components are to be placed on the  board in ﬁ  nal assembly. In modern industrial practice, a bar code is also printed on  the board for production control purposes.  

#  Printed Circuit Board Assembly  

A printed circuit board assembly consists of electronic components (e.g., IC pack- ages, resistors, capacitors) as well as mechanical components (e.g., fasteners, heat  sinks) mounted on a printed circuit board. This is level 2 in electronic packaging  (Table 34.1). As indicated, PCB assembly is based on either surface-mount techno- logy (SMT) or through-hole technology (see Figure 34.2). Some PCB assemblies  include both SMT and through-hole components. The discussion in this section  covers both categories as well as combinations of the two. The scope of electronic  assembly also includes higher packaging levels such as assemblies of multiple  PCBs electrically connected and mechanically contained in a chassis or cabinet.  Section 34.4 explores the technologies by which electrical connections are made at  these higher levels.  

# 34.3.1  SURFACE MOUNT TECHNOLOGY  

Since the late 1980s, the use of surface mount technology has grown to the point  where it is now the dominant process in printed circuit board assembly. The earlier  through-hole technology has the following inherent limitations in terms of packing  density: (1) components can be mounted on only one side of the board, and (2) center- to-center distance between lead pins in leaded components must be a minimum of  $1.0\:\mathrm{mm}\:(0.04\:\mathrm{in})$  and is usually $2.5\,\mathrm{mm}\,(0.10\,\mathrm{in})$ .  

Surface-mount technology uses an assembly method in which component leads  are soldered to lands on the surface of the board rather than into holes running  through the board (Historical Note 34.2). By eliminating the need for leads inserted  into through holes in the board, several advantages are gained: (1) smaller compo- nents are available, with leads closer together; (2) circuit densities can be increased;  (3) components can be mounted on both sides of the board; (4) smaller PCBs can be  used for the same electronic system; and (5) drilling of the many through holes dur- ing board fabrication is eliminated although via holes to interconnect layers are still  required [6]. Typical areas on the board surface taken by SMT components range  between $20\%$  and $60\%$  compared to through-hole components.  

# Historical Note 34.2  Surface-mount technology  

Printed circuit board assemblies based on through- hole technology were the predominant electronics  packaging method from the 1950s through most of the  1980s, when surface-mount technology (SMT) started  to be widely used.  

SMT traces its origins to the electronic systems  in the aerospace and military industries of the 1960s,  with the IBM Corporation responsible for much of  the original development work. The ﬁ  rst components  were small, ﬂ  at ceramic packages with gull-wing  leads. The initial reason why these packages were  attrac  tive, compared with through-hole technology,  was the fact that they could be placed on both sides  of a printed circuit board—in effect, doubling the com- ponent density.

What is etching used for in PCB fabrication?,Answer. Etching is used to remove copper cladding on the PCB surface to define the tracks and lands of the circuit.,"Etching in PCB fabrication is used to remove the copper cladding from the unprotected regions of the board surface. This process transforms the solid copper film into the desired circuit pattern by leaving the copper only in areas that are covered by resist. The etching process is critical for creating the interconnections and conductive paths that form the electrical circuit on the PCB. Controlling etching parameters such as temperature, concentration, and duration is vital to prevent over- or under-etching, ensuring accurate circuit pattern formation.","Etching  removes the copper cladding in the unprotected regions from the board  surface, usually by means of a chemical etchant. Etching is the step that transforms  the solid copper ﬁ  lm into the interconnections for an electrical circuit.  

Etching is done in an etching chamber in which the etchant is sprayed onto the  surface of the board that is now partially coated with resist. Various etchants are  used to remove copper, including ammonium persulfate  $\mathrm{((NH_{4})_{2}S_{2}O_{4})}$ , ammonium  hydroxide  $\mathrm{(NH_{4}O H)}$ , cupric chloride  $\left(\operatorname{CuCl}_{2}\right)$ , and ferric chloride  $\left(\mathrm{{FeCl}}_{3}\right)$ . Each has  its relative advantages and disadvantages. Process parameters (e.g., temperature,  etchant concentration, and duration) must be closely controlled to avoid over- or  under-etching, as in IC fabrication. After etching, the board must be rinsed and the  remaining resist chemically stripped from the surface.  

Plating   In printed circuit boards, plating is needed on the hole surfaces to provide  conductive paths from one side to the other in double-sided boards, or between layers  in multilayer boards. Two types of plating process are used in PCB fabrication: electro- plating and electroless plating (Section 27.3). Electroplating has a higher deposition  rate than electroless plating but requires that the coated surface be metallic (conduc- tive). Electroless plating is slower but does not require a conductive surface.  

After drilling of the via holes and insertion holes, the walls of the holes consist  of epoxy-glass insulation material, which is nonconductive. Accordingly, electroless  plating must be used initially to provide a thin coating of copper on the hole walls.  Once the thin ﬁ  lm of copper has been applied, electrolytic plating is then used to  increase coating thickness on the hole surfaces to between 0.025 and $0.05\,\mathrm{mm}$  (0.001  and 0.002 in).  

Gold is another metal sometimes plated onto printed circuit boards. It is used as  a very thin coating on PCB edge connectors to provide superior electrical contact.  Coating thickness is only about $2.5\;\mu\mathrm{m}$  (0.0001 in).

# 34.2.4  PCB FABRICATION SEQUENCE  

This section describes the processing sequence for various board types. The sequence  is concerned with transforming a copper-clad board of reinforced polymer into a  printed circuit board, a procedure called  circuitization . The desired result is illus- trated in Figure 34.4 for a double-sided board.  

Circuitization   Three methods of circuitization can be used to determine which  regions of the board will be coated with copper [13]: (1) subtractive, (2) additive, and  (3) semiadditive.  

In the  subtractive method , open portions of the copper cladding on the starting  board are etched away from the surface, so that the tracks and lands of the desired  circuit remain. The process is called “subtractive” because copper is removed from  the board surface. The steps in the subtractive method are described in Figure 34.5.  

The  additive method  starts with a board surface that is not copper clad, such  as the uncoated surface of a single-sided board. However, the uncoated surface is  treated with a chemical, called a  buttercoat , which acts as the catalyst for electroless  plating. The steps in the method are outlined in Figure 34.6.  

! Cemented carbide or coated carbide are favored  over high speed steel as the tool material.  

The small hole size, combined with the stacking of several boards or multilayer  boards, result in a high depth-to-diameter ratio, aggravating the problem of chip  extraction from the hole. Other requirements placed on the operation include high  accuracy in hole location, smooth hole walls, and absence of burrs on the holes. Burrs  are usually formed when the drill enters or exits a hole; thin sheets of material are  often placed on top of and beneath the stack of boards to inhibit burr formation on  the boards themselves.  

Finally, any cutting tool must be used at a certain cutting speed to operate at best  efﬁ  ciency. For a drill bit, cutting speed is measured at the diameter. For very small  drill sizes, this means extremely high rotational speeds—up to  $100{,}000\ \mathrm{rev/min}$  in  some cases. Special spindle bearings and motors are required to achieve these speeds.  

Circuit Pattern Imaging and Etching   There are two basic methods by which  the circuit pattern is transferred to the copper surface of the board: screen printing  and photolithography. Both methods involve the use of a resist coating on the board  surface that determines where etching of the copper will occur to create the tracks  and lands of the circuit.  

Screen printing was the ﬁ  rst method used for PCBs. It is indeed a printing tech- nique, and the term  printed circuit board  can be traced to this method. In  screen print- ing , a stencil screen containing the circuit pattern is placed on the board, and liquid  resist is squeezed through the mesh to the surface beneath. This method is simple and  inexpensive, but its resolution is limited. It is normally used only for applications in  which track widths are greater than about  $0.25\:\mathrm{mm}$  (0.010 in).  

The second method of transferring the circuit pattern is  photolithography , in  which a light-sensitive resist material is exposed through a mask to transfer the cir- cuit pattern. The procedure is similar to the corresponding process in IC fabrication  (Section 33.3.1); some of the details in PCB processing will be described here.  

Photoresists used by circuit fabricators are available in two forms: liquid or  dry ﬁ  lm. Liquid resists can be applied by roller or spraying. Dry ﬁ  lm resists are  more commonly used in PCB fabrication. They consist of three layers: a ﬁ  lm  of photosensitive polymer sandwiched between a polyester support sheet on  one side and a removable plastic cover sheet on the other side. The cover sheet  prevents the photosensitive material from sticking during storage and handling.  Although more expensive than liquid resists, dry ﬁ  lm resists form coatings of  uniform thickness, and their processing in photolithography is simpler. To apply,  the cover sheet is removed, and the resist ﬁ  lm is placed on the copper surface to  which it readily adheres. Hot rollers are used to press and smooth the resist onto  the surface.  

Alignment of the masks relative to the board relies on the use of registration  holes that are aligned with the tooling holes on the board. Contact printing is used  to expose the resist beneath the mask. The resist is then developed, which involves  removal of the unexposed regions of the negative resist from the surface.  

After resist development, certain areas of the copper surface remain covered by  resist while other areas are now unprotected. The covered areas correspond to cir- cuit tracks and lands, while uncovered areas correspond to open regions between.  Etching  removes the copper cladding in the unprotected regions from the board  surface, usually by means of a chemical etchant. Etching is the step that transforms  the solid copper ﬁ  lm into the interconnections for an electrical circuit.  

Etching is done in an etching chamber in which the etchant is sprayed onto the  surface of the board that is now partially coated with resist. Various etchants are  used to remove copper, including ammonium persulfate  $\mathrm{((NH_{4})_{2}S_{2}O_{4})}$ , ammonium  hydroxide  $\mathrm{(NH_{4}O H)}$ , cupric chloride  $\left(\operatorname{CuCl}_{2}\right)$ , and ferric chloride  $\left(\mathrm{{FeCl}}_{3}\right)$ . Each has  its relative advantages and disadvantages. This section  emphasizes the details that are relevant to PCB fabrication. The discussion proceeds  approximately in the order in which the processes are performed on a board. How- ever, there are differences in processing sequence between different board types,  and these differences are examined in Section 34.2.4. Some of the operations in PCB  fabrication must be performed under clean room conditions to avoid defects in the  printed circuits, especially for boards with ﬁ  ne tracks and details.  

Board Preparation  Initial preparation of the board consists of shearing, hole- making, and other shaping operations to create tabs, slots, and similar features in  the board. If necessary, the starting panel may have to be sheared to size for com- patibility with the circuit fabricator’s equipment. The holes, called tooling holes, are  made by drilling or punching and are used for positioning the board during subse- quent processing. The sequence of fabrication steps requires close alignment from  one process to the next, and these holes are used with locating pins at each operation  to achieve accurate registration. Three tooling holes per board are usually sufﬁ  cient  for this purpose; hole size is about $3.2\:\mathrm{mm}$  (0.125 in), larger than the circuit holes to  be drilled later.  

The board is typically bar coded for identiﬁ  cation purposes in this preparation  phase. Finally, a cleaning process is used to remove dirt and grease from the board  surface. Although cleanliness requirements are not as stringent as in IC fabrication,  small particles of dirt and dust can cause defects in the circuit pattern of a printed  circuit board; and surface ﬁ  lms of grease can inhibit etching and other chemical  processes. Cleanliness is essential for producing reliable PCBs.  

Hole Drilling   In addition to tooling holes, functional circuit holes are required  in PCBs as (1)  insertion holes  for inserting leads of components that are based on  through-hole technology, (2)  via holes , which are later copper-plated and used as  conducting paths from one side of the board to the other, and (3) holes to fasten  certain components such as heat sinks and connectors to the board. These holes  are either drilled or punched, using the tooling holes for location. Cleaner holes  can be produced by drilling, so most holes in PCB fabrication are drilled. A stack  of three or four panels may be drilled in the same operation, using a computer  numerically controlled (CNC) drill press that receives its programming instruc- tions from the design database. For high-production jobs, multiple-spindle drills  are sometimes used, permitting all of the holes in the board to be drilled in one  feed motion.  

Standard twist drills (Section 22.3.2) are used to drill the holes, but the application  makes a number of unusual demands on the drill and drilling equipment. Perhaps the  biggest single problem is the small hole size in printed circuit boards; drill diameter  is generally less than  $1.27\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.050 in), but some high-density boards require hole  sizes of  $0.15~\mathrm{mm}~(0.006~\mathrm{in})$  or even less [8]. Such small drill bits lack strength, and  their capacity to dissipate heat is low.  

Another difﬁ  culty is the unique work material. The drill bit must ﬁ  rst pass  through a thin copper foil and then proceed through an abrasive epoxy-glass com- posite. Different drills would normally be speciﬁ  ed for these materials, but a single  drill must sufﬁ  ce in PCB drilling. Cemented carbide or coated carbide are favored  over high speed steel as the tool material.  

The small hole size, combined with the stacking of several boards or multilayer  boards, result in a high depth-to-diameter ratio, aggravating the problem of chip  extraction from the hole. Other requirements placed on the operation include high  accuracy in hole location, smooth hole walls, and absence of burrs on the holes. Burrs  are usually formed when the drill enters or exits a hole; thin sheets of material are  often placed on top of and beneath the stack of boards to inhibit burr formation on  the boards themselves.  

Finally, any cutting tool must be used at a certain cutting speed to operate at best  efﬁ  ciency. For a drill bit, cutting speed is measured at the diameter.

"What is continuity testing, and when is it performed in the PCB fabrication sequence?","Answer. Continuity testing is an electrical test in which contact probes are brought into contact with track and land areas to insure the existence of electrical conduction paths. Continuity tests are generally used: (1) after the bare board has been fabricated, and (2) after the board has been populated with components.","Continuity testing is a quality control procedure used in PCB fabrication to ensure that electrical connections between various points on the board are complete and functioning as intended. It involves using contact probes to make simultaneous contact with track and land areas on the board's surface. The probes check electrical connections between specified points quickly to detect any open circuits or unintended discontinuities.

Continuity testing is performed after the circuit has been fabricated on the board surface. It takes place during the testing and finishing operations phase of the PCB manufacturing process. This stage follows the drilling, plating, and etching steps and is crucial for verifying the board's functionality and detecting any faults that might have occurred during earlier manufacturing stages.","The interconnection is accomplished by means of copper-plated via holes that run  from lands on one surface of the board to lands on the opposite surface, as shown  in Figure 34.4. A typical fabrication sequence for a double-sided board (copper- clad on both sides) uses the semiadditive method. After hole drilling, electroless  plating is used to initially plate the holes, followed by electroplating to increase  plating thickness.  

A  multilayer board  is structurally the most complex of the three types, and this  complexity is reﬂ  ected in its manufacturing sequence. The laminated construction can  be seen in Figure 34.8, which highlights some of the features of a multilayer PCB.  The fabrication steps for the individual layers are basically the same as those used  for single- and double-sided boards. What makes multilayer board fabrication more  complicated is that (1) all of the layers, each with its own circuit design, must ﬁ  rst be  processed; then (2) the layers must be joined together to form one integral board; and  ﬁ  nally (3) the assembled board must itself be put through its own processing sequence.  

A multilayer board consists of  logic layers , which carry electrical signals between  components on the board, and  voltage layers , which are used to distribute power.  Logic layers are generally fabricated from double-sided boards, whereas voltage  layers are usually made from single-sided boards. Thinner insulating substrates  are used for multi  layer boards than for their standalone single- and double-sided  counter  parts, so that a suitable thickness of the ﬁ  nal board can be achieved.  

In the second stage, the individual layers are assembled together. The procedure  starts with copper foil on the bottom outside, and then adds the individual layers,  separating one from the next by one or more sheets of glass fabric impregnated with  partially cured epoxy. After all layers have been sandwiched together, a ﬁ  nal copper  foil is placed on the stack to form the top outer layer. Layers are then bonded into a  single board by heating the assembly under pressure to cure the epoxy. After curing,  any excess resin squeezed out of the sandwich around the edges is trimmed away.  

At the start of the third stage of fabrication, the board consists of multiple layers  bonded together, with copper foil cladded on its outer surfaces. Its construction can  therefore be likened to that of a double-sided board; and its processing is likewise  similar. The sequence consists of drilling additional through-holes, plating the holes  to establish conduction paths between the two exterior copper ﬁ  lms as well as cer- tain internal copper layers, and the use of photolithography and etching to form the  circuit pattern on the outer copper surfaces.  

Testing and Finishing Operations  After a circuit has been fabricated on the  board surface, it must be inspected and tested to ensure that it functions according  to design speciﬁ  cations and contains no quality defects. Two procedures are com- mon: (1) visual inspection and (2) continuity testing. In  visual inspection , the board  is examined visually to detect open and short circuits, errors in drilled hole loca- tions, and other faults that can be observed without applying electrical power to the  board. Visual inspections, performed not only after fabrication but also at various  critical stages during production, are accomplished by human eye or machine vision  (Section 40.6.3).  

Continuity testing  involves the use of contact probes brought simultaneously into  contact with track and land areas on the board surface. The setup consists of an array  of probes that are forced under light pressure to make contact with speciﬁ  ed points  on the board surface. Electrical connections between contact points can be quickly  checked in this procedure.  

Several additional processing steps must be performed on the bare board to pre- pare it for assembly. The ﬁ  rst of these ﬁ  nishing operations is the application of a thin  solder layer on the track and land surfaces. This layer serves to protect the copper  from oxidation and contamination. It is carried out either by electroplating or by  bringing the copper side into contact with rotating rollers that are partially sub- mersed in molten solder.  

A second operation involves application of a coating of solder resist to all areas of  the board surface except the lands that are to be subsequently soldered in assembly. Inspection  After cleaning, the PCB assembly is inspected for defective solder  joints. Inspection of soldering quality is somewhat more difﬁ  cult for surface-mount  circuits (SMCs) because these assemblies are generally more densely packed, the  solder joints are smaller, and joint geometries are different from those in through- hole assemblies. One of the problems is the way surface mount components are held  in place during soldering. In through-hole assembly, the components are mechani- cally fastened in place by clinched leads. In SMT assembly, components are held by  solder paste or adhesive. At soldering temperatures this method of attachment is not  as secure, and components sometimes shift. Another problem with the smaller sizes  in SMT is a greater likelihood of solder bridges forming between adjacent leads,  resulting in short circuits.  

Visual inspection is used to detect for board substrate damage, missing or damaged  components, soldering faults, and similar quality defects that can be observed by eye.  Machine vision systems are being used to perform these inspections automatically in  a growing number of installations.  

Testing  Test procedures must be performed on the completed assembly to verify  its functionality. The board design must allow for this testing by including test points  in the circuit layout. These test points are convenient locations in the circuit where  probes can make contact for testing. Individual components in the circuit are tested  by contacting the component leads, applying input test signals, and measuring the  output signals. More sophisticated procedures include digital function tests, in which  the entire circuit or major subcircuits are tested using a programmed sequence of  input signals and measuring the corresponding output signals to simulate operating  conditions.  

Another test used for printed circuit board assemblies is the substitution test,  in which a production unit is plugged into a mock-up of the working system and  energized to perform its functions. If the assembly performs in a satisfactory way, it  is deemed as passing the test. It is then unplugged, and the next production unit is  substituted in the mock-up.  

Finally, a burn-in test is performed on certain types of PCB assemblies that may  be subject to “infant mortality.” Some boards contain defects that are not revealed in  normal functional tests but which are likely to cause failure of the circuit during early  service. Burn-in tests operate the assemblies under power for a certain period of time,  such as 24 or 72 hours, sometimes at elevated temperatures, such as $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(100^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ , to  force these defects to manifest their failures during the testing period. Boards not  subject to infant mortality will survive this test and provide long service life.  

The smaller scale of SMT poses problems in circuit testing because less space is  available around each component. Contact probes must be physically smaller and  more probes are required because SMT assemblies are more densely populated.  One way of dealing with this issue is to design the circuit layout with extra lands  whose only purpose is to provide a test probe contact site. Unfortunately, including  these test lands runs counter to the goal of achieving higher packing densities on the  SMT board.  

Rework  When inspection and testing indicate that one or more components on  the board are defective, or certain solder joints are faulty, it usually makes sense  to try to repair the assembly rather than discard it together with all of the other  components that are not defective. This repair step is an integral part of electronic  assembly plant operations. Common rework tasks include touchup (repair of solder  faults), replacement of defective or missing components, and repair of copper ﬁ  lm  that has lifted from the substrate surface. These tasks are manual operations, requir- ing skilled workers using soldering irons. Rework of surface-mount assemblies is  more difﬁ  cult than in conventional PIH assemblies, again because of the smaller  component sizes. Special tools are required, such as small-bit soldering irons, magni- fying devices, and instruments for grasping and manipulating the small parts.  

#  Electrical Connector Technology  

PCB assemblies must be connected to back planes, and into racks and cabinets, and  these cabinets must be connected to other cabinets and systems by means of cables.  The growing use of electronics in so many types of products has made electrical  connections an important technology. The performance of any electronic system  depends on the reliability of the individual connections linking the components of  the system together. This section is concerned with connector technology that is  usually applied at the third and higher levels of electronics packaging. This section  emphasizes the details that are relevant to PCB fabrication. The discussion proceeds  approximately in the order in which the processes are performed on a board. How- ever, there are differences in processing sequence between different board types,  and these differences are examined in Section 34.2.4. Some of the operations in PCB  fabrication must be performed under clean room conditions to avoid defects in the  printed circuits, especially for boards with ﬁ  ne tracks and details.

Hole Drilling   In addition to tooling holes, functional circuit holes are required  in PCBs as (1)  insertion holes  for inserting leads of components that are based on  through-hole technology, (2)  via holes , which are later copper-plated and used as  conducting paths from one side of the board to the other, and (3) holes to fasten  certain components such as heat sinks and connectors to the board. These holes  are either drilled or punched, using the tooling holes for location. Cleaner holes  can be produced by drilling, so most holes in PCB fabrication are drilled. A stack  of three or four panels may be drilled in the same operation, using a computer  numerically controlled (CNC) drill press that receives its programming instruc- tions from the design database. For high-production jobs, multiple-spindle drills  are sometimes used, permitting all of the holes in the board to be drilled in one  feed motion.  

Standard twist drills (Section 22.3.2) are used to drill the holes, but the application  makes a number of unusual demands on the drill and drilling equipment. Perhaps the  biggest single problem is the small hole size in printed circuit boards; drill diameter  is generally less than  $1.27\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.050 in), but some high-density boards require hole  sizes of  $0.15~\mathrm{mm}~(0.006~\mathrm{in})$  or even less [8]. Such small drill bits lack strength, and  their capacity to dissipate heat is low.  

Another difﬁ  culty is the unique work material. The drill bit must ﬁ  rst pass  through a thin copper foil and then proceed through an abrasive epoxy-glass com- posite. Different drills would normally be speciﬁ  ed for these materials, but a single  drill must sufﬁ  ce in PCB drilling. Cemented carbide or coated carbide are favored  over high speed steel as the tool material.  

The small hole size, combined with the stacking of several boards or multilayer  boards, result in a high depth-to-diameter ratio, aggravating the problem of chip  extraction from the hole. Other requirements placed on the operation include high  accuracy in hole location, smooth hole walls, and absence of burrs on the holes. Burrs  are usually formed when the drill enters or exits a hole; thin sheets of material are  often placed on top of and beneath the stack of boards to inhibit burr formation on  the boards themselves.  

Finally, any cutting tool must be used at a certain cutting speed to operate at best  efﬁ  ciency. For a drill bit, cutting speed is measured at the diameter.

"What are the two main categories of printed circuit board assemblies, as distinguished by the method of attaching components to the board?","Answer. The two categories are: (1) pin-in-hole technology, also known as through-hole technology; and (2) surface mount technology.","The two main categories of printed circuit board assemblies, distinguished by the method of attaching components, are:

1. **Through-Hole Technology (THT) or Pin-in-Hole (PIH) Technology**: This method involves inserting component leads into pre-drilled holes on the board and soldering them in place. It allows sturdy mechanical and electrical connections, making it suitable for components that require additional support or need to be larger in size.

2. **Surface-Mount Technology (SMT)**: In this method, components are directly mounted and soldered onto the surface of the PCB. SMT components are generally smaller and do not require holes to be drilled in the board, allowing for higher circuit densities and enabling components to be mounted on both sides of the board.

Each technology has its own advantages, with SMT being more prevalent in modern electronics due to its efficiency in space utilization and assembly speed.","Upper PCB  assembly is through- hole technology  (pin-in-hole) whereas  lower assembly is  mostly surface-mount  technology.

The assembled PCBs are, in turn, connected to a chassis or other framework; this  is the  third level of packaging . This third level may consist of a  rack  that holds the  boards, using wire cables to make the interconnections. In major electronic systems,  such as large computers, the PCBs are typically mounted onto a larger printed cir- cuit board called a  back plane , which has conduction paths to permit interconnec- tion between the smaller boards attached to it. This latter conﬁ  guration is known as  card-on-board  (COB) packaging, in which the smaller PCBs are called cards and  the back plane is the board.  

The  fourth level of packaging  consists of wiring and cabling inside the cabinet  that contains the electronic system. For systems of relatively low complexity, the  packaging may not include all of the possible levels in the hierarchy.  

A printed circuit board consists of one or more thin sheets of insulating material,  with thin copper lines on one or both surfaces that interconnect the components  attached to the board. In boards consisting of more than one layer, copper conduct- ing paths are interleaved between the layers. PCBs are used in packaged electronic  systems to hold components, provide electrical interconnections among them, and  make connections to external circuits. They have become standard building blocks  in virtually all electronic systems that contain packaged ICs and other components  (Historical Note 34.1). PCBs are so important and widely used because (1) they  provide a convenient structural platform for the components; (2) a board with cor- rectly routed interconnections can be mass produced consistently, without the varia- bility usually associated with hand wiring; (3) nearly all of the soldering connections  between components and the PCB can be accomplished in a one-step mechanized  

# Historical Note 34.1  Printed circuit boards  

Before printed circuit boards, electrical and electronic  components were manually fastened to a sheet-metal  chassis (usually aluminum) and then hand wired and  soldered to form the desired circuit. This was called  point-to-point construction. In the late 1950s, various  plastic boards became commercially available. These  boards, which provided electrical insulation, gradually  replaced the aluminum chassis.  The ﬁ  rst plastics were  phenolics, followed by glass-ﬁ  ber-reinforced epoxies.  The boards came with predrilled holes spaced at  standard intervals in both directions. This motivated  the use of electronic components that matched these  hole spacings.  The dual-in-line package evolved during  this period.  

The components in these circuit boards were hand- wired, which proved increasingly difﬁ  cult and prone to  human error as component densities increased and cir- cuits became more complex. The printed circuit board,  with etched copper foil on its surface to form the wiring  interconnections, was developed in the 1950s to solve  these problems with manual wiring. The printed circuit  boards during that period used through-hole technology,  and PCBs had to be drilled to accommodate the com- ponent leads. The original technique for “printing” the  circuit pattern onto the copper-clad board was screen  printing. In the late 1980s, surface mount technology  began to replace through-hole construction. SMT did  not require lead holes, and the components were signi- ﬁ  cantly smaller, allowing much higher circuit densities  to be achieved on the printed circuit boards. As track  widths became ﬁ  ner and ﬁ  ner, photolithography was  substituted for screen printing.  

Initial techniques to design the circuit masks involved  a manual inking procedure, in which the designer at- tempted to route the conducting tracks to provide the  required connections and avoid short circuits on a large  sheet of paper or vellum. This became more difﬁ  cult as  the number of components on the board increased and  the conducting lines interconnecting the components  became ﬁ  ner. Computer programs were developed to  aid the designer in solving the routing problem. How- ever, in many cases, it was impossible to ﬁ  nd a solu- tion with no intersecting tracks (short circuits). To solve  the problem, jumper wires were hand-soldered to the  board to make these connections. # Electronics  Assembly and  Packaging

Integrated circuits constitute the brains of an electronic  system, but the complete system consists of much more  than packaged ICs. The ICs and other components are  mounted and interconnected on printed circuit boards,  which in turn are interconnected and contained in a  chassis or cabinet. Chip packaging (Section 33.6) is  only part of the total electronic package. This chapter  considers the remaining levels of packaging and how  the packages are manufactured and assembled.  

# Electronics  Packaging  

The electronics package is the physical means by which  the components in a system are electrically inter- connected and interfaced to external devices; it includes  the mechanical structure that holds and protects the  circuitry. A well-designed electronics package serves  the following functions: (1) power distribution and sig- nal interconnection, (2) structural support, (3) circuit  protection from physical and chemical hazards in the  environment, (4) dissipation of heat generated by the  circuits, and (5) minimum delays in signal transmission  within the system.  

For complex systems containing many components  and interconnections, the electronics package is organ- ized into levels that comprise a  packaging hierarchy ,  illus  trated in Figure 34.1 and summarized in Table 34.1.  The lowest level is the  zero level , which refers to the  intra connections on the semiconductor chip. The pack- aged chip (chip carrier), consisting of the IC in a plas- tic or ceramic enclosure and connected to the package  leads, constitutes the  ﬁ  rst level of packaging .  

Packaged chips and other components are assembled  to a printed circuit board (PCB) using two technologies  (Section 33.6.1): (1)  surface-mount technology  (SMT)  

![](images/1e20e72922781b4cf2ccd18b84212143ea7a904759ad35c3b86dcb235827b20d.jpg)  

and (2)  through-hole technology , also known as  pin-in-hole  (PIH) technology. Today,  SMT is much more widely used in industry, especially for mass-produced products.  The chip package styles and assembly techniques are different for SMT and PIH. In  many cases, both assembly technologies are employed in the same board. Printed cir- cuit board assembly represents the  second level of packaging . Figure 34.2 shows two  PCB assemblies, illustrating both PIH and SMT types. Note the smaller component  sizes of the SMT board.

The assembled PCBs are, in turn, connected to a chassis or other framework; this  is the  third level of packaging . This third level may consist of a  rack  that holds the  boards, using wire cables to make the interconnections. In major electronic systems,  such as large computers, the PCBs are typically mounted onto a larger printed cir- cuit board called a  back plane , which has conduction paths to permit interconnec- tion between the smaller boards attached to it. The setup consists of an array  of probes that are forced under light pressure to make contact with speciﬁ  ed points  on the board surface. Electrical connections between contact points can be quickly  checked in this procedure.  

Several additional processing steps must be performed on the bare board to pre- pare it for assembly. The ﬁ  rst of these ﬁ  nishing operations is the application of a thin  solder layer on the track and land surfaces. This layer serves to protect the copper  from oxidation and contamination. It is carried out either by electroplating or by  bringing the copper side into contact with rotating rollers that are partially sub- mersed in molten solder.  

A second operation involves application of a coating of solder resist to all areas of  the board surface except the lands that are to be subsequently soldered in assembly.  The solder resist coating is chemically formulated to resist adhesion of solder; thus,  in the subsequent soldering processes, solder adheres only to land areas. Solder resist  is usually applied by screen printing.  

Finally, an identiﬁ  cation legend is printed onto the surface, again by screen print- ing. The legend indicates where the different components are to be placed on the  board in ﬁ  nal assembly. In modern industrial practice, a bar code is also printed on  the board for production control purposes.  

#  Printed Circuit Board Assembly  

A printed circuit board assembly consists of electronic components (e.g., IC pack- ages, resistors, capacitors) as well as mechanical components (e.g., fasteners, heat  sinks) mounted on a printed circuit board. This is level 2 in electronic packaging  (Table 34.1). As indicated, PCB assembly is based on either surface-mount techno- logy (SMT) or through-hole technology (see Figure 34.2). Some PCB assemblies  include both SMT and through-hole components. The discussion in this section  covers both categories as well as combinations of the two. The scope of electronic  assembly also includes higher packaging levels such as assemblies of multiple  PCBs electrically connected and mechanically contained in a chassis or cabinet.  Section 34.4 explores the technologies by which electrical connections are made at  these higher levels.  

# 34.3.1  SURFACE MOUNT TECHNOLOGY  

Since the late 1980s, the use of surface mount technology has grown to the point  where it is now the dominant process in printed circuit board assembly. The earlier  through-hole technology has the following inherent limitations in terms of packing  density: (1) components can be mounted on only one side of the board, and (2) center- to-center distance between lead pins in leaded components must be a minimum of  $1.0\:\mathrm{mm}\:(0.04\:\mathrm{in})$  and is usually $2.5\,\mathrm{mm}\,(0.10\,\mathrm{in})$ .  

Surface-mount technology uses an assembly method in which component leads  are soldered to lands on the surface of the board rather than into holes running  through the board (Historical Note 34.2). By eliminating the need for leads inserted  into through holes in the board, several advantages are gained: (1) smaller compo- nents are available, with leads closer together; (2) circuit densities can be increased;  (3) components can be mounted on both sides of the board; (4) smaller PCBs can be  used for the same electronic system; and (5) drilling of the many through holes dur- ing board fabrication is eliminated although via holes to interconnect layers are still  required [6]. Typical areas on the board surface taken by SMT components range  between $20\%$  and $60\%$  compared to through-hole components.  

# Historical Note 34.2  Surface-mount technology  

Printed circuit board assemblies based on through- hole technology were the predominant electronics  packaging method from the 1950s through most of the  1980s, when surface-mount technology (SMT) started  to be widely used.  

SMT traces its origins to the electronic systems  in the aerospace and military industries of the 1960s,  with the IBM Corporation responsible for much of  the original development work. The ﬁ  rst components  were small, ﬂ  at ceramic packages with gull-wing  leads. The initial reason why these packages were  attrac  tive, compared with through-hole technology,  was the fact that they could be placed on both sides  of a printed circuit board—in effect, doubling the com- ponent density.

What are some of the reasons and defects that make rework an integral step in the PCB fabrication sequence?,"Answer. Rework is required to correct the following types of defects: (1) replace defective components, (2) insert missing components, (3) repair faulty solder joints, and (4) repair of copper film that has lifted from the substrate surface.","Rework is an integral step in PCB fabrication due to several reasons and defects:

1. **Defective Solder Joints**: Surface-mount technology (SMT) assemblies often face challenges with solder joint defects due to smaller joint geometries and densely packed components. Solder bridges and cold joints are common issues that require correction to prevent short circuits and ensure proper electrical connectivity.

2. **Component Shifts**: During SMT soldering, components are held by solder paste or adhesive, which can be less secure at soldering temperatures. This can cause components to shift, leading to misalignment and improper functioning of the PCB.

3. **Missing or Damaged Components**: During the assembly process, components can be incorrectly placed or damaged. Visual and automated inspections often reveal these defects, necessitating rework to replace or correctly place the components.

4. **Copper Film Lifting**: During PCB fabrication, the copper film on the substrate can lift due to improper process handling or material defects. This negatively affects the conductivity and thus requires careful repair to maintain circuit integrity.

5. **High Costs and Resource Conservation**: Discarding defective PCBs would result in a considerable waste of materials and resources. Reworking allows manufacturers to salvage valuable components and reduce material wastage, thus enhancing overall production efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

These factors make rework a necessary and integral part of PCB manufacturing, ensuring that defects are corrected before the boards are finalized and shipped.","Inspection  After cleaning, the PCB assembly is inspected for defective solder  joints. Inspection of soldering quality is somewhat more difﬁ  cult for surface-mount  circuits (SMCs) because these assemblies are generally more densely packed, the  solder joints are smaller, and joint geometries are different from those in through- hole assemblies. One of the problems is the way surface mount components are held  in place during soldering. In through-hole assembly, the components are mechani- cally fastened in place by clinched leads. In SMT assembly, components are held by  solder paste or adhesive. At soldering temperatures this method of attachment is not  as secure, and components sometimes shift. Another problem with the smaller sizes  in SMT is a greater likelihood of solder bridges forming between adjacent leads,  resulting in short circuits.  

Visual inspection is used to detect for board substrate damage, missing or damaged  components, soldering faults, and similar quality defects that can be observed by eye.  Machine vision systems are being used to perform these inspections automatically in  a growing number of installations.  

Testing  Test procedures must be performed on the completed assembly to verify  its functionality. The board design must allow for this testing by including test points  in the circuit layout. These test points are convenient locations in the circuit where  probes can make contact for testing. Individual components in the circuit are tested  by contacting the component leads, applying input test signals, and measuring the  output signals. More sophisticated procedures include digital function tests, in which  the entire circuit or major subcircuits are tested using a programmed sequence of  input signals and measuring the corresponding output signals to simulate operating  conditions.  

Another test used for printed circuit board assemblies is the substitution test,  in which a production unit is plugged into a mock-up of the working system and  energized to perform its functions. If the assembly performs in a satisfactory way, it  is deemed as passing the test. It is then unplugged, and the next production unit is  substituted in the mock-up.  

Finally, a burn-in test is performed on certain types of PCB assemblies that may  be subject to “infant mortality.” Some boards contain defects that are not revealed in  normal functional tests but which are likely to cause failure of the circuit during early  service. Burn-in tests operate the assemblies under power for a certain period of time,  such as 24 or 72 hours, sometimes at elevated temperatures, such as $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(100^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ , to  force these defects to manifest their failures during the testing period. Boards not  subject to infant mortality will survive this test and provide long service life.  

The smaller scale of SMT poses problems in circuit testing because less space is  available around each component. Contact probes must be physically smaller and  more probes are required because SMT assemblies are more densely populated.  One way of dealing with this issue is to design the circuit layout with extra lands  whose only purpose is to provide a test probe contact site. Unfortunately, including  these test lands runs counter to the goal of achieving higher packing densities on the  SMT board.  

Rework  When inspection and testing indicate that one or more components on  the board are defective, or certain solder joints are faulty, it usually makes sense  to try to repair the assembly rather than discard it together with all of the other  components that are not defective. This repair step is an integral part of electronic  assembly plant operations. Common rework tasks include touchup (repair of solder  faults), replacement of defective or missing components, and repair of copper ﬁ  lm  that has lifted from the substrate surface. These tasks are manual operations, requir- ing skilled workers using soldering irons. Rework of surface-mount assemblies is  more difﬁ  cult than in conventional PIH assemblies, again because of the smaller  component sizes. Special tools are required, such as small-bit soldering irons, magni- fying devices, and instruments for grasping and manipulating the small parts.  

#  Electrical Connector Technology  

PCB assemblies must be connected to back planes, and into racks and cabinets, and  these cabinets must be connected to other cabinets and systems by means of cables.  The growing use of electronics in so many types of products has made electrical  connections an important technology. The performance of any electronic system  depends on the reliability of the individual connections linking the components of  the system together. This section is concerned with connector technology that is  usually applied at the third and higher levels of electronics packaging. These are caused by variations or incorrect  settings in process parameters. Examples include added layers that are too thin  or too thick, insufﬁ  cient diffusion depths in doping, and over- or under-etching. In  general these defects are correctable by improved process control or development  of alter  native processes that are superior. For example, doping by ion implantation  has largely replaced diffusion, and dry plasma etching has been substituted for wet  chemical etching to better control feature dimensions.  

Point defects  occur at very localized areas on the wafer surface, affecting only one  or a limited number of ICs in a particular area. They are commonly caused by dust  particles either on the wafer surface or the lithographic masks. Point defects also  include dislocations in the crystal lattice structure (Section 2.3.2). These point defects  are distributed in some way over the surface of the wafer, resulting in a yield that is  a function of the density of the defects, their distribution over the surface, and the  processed area of the wafer. If the area defects are assumed negligible, and the point  defects are assumed uniform over the surface area of the wafer, the resulting yield  can be modeled by the equation  

$$
Y_{m}={\frac{1}{1+A D}}
$$  

where  $Y_{m}=$  the yield of good chips as determined in multiprobe;  $A\,=$ the area  processed,  $\mathrm{cm}^{2}\ \mathrm{(in}^{2}\mathrm{)}$ ; and  $D\;=\;$ density of point defects, defects $/\mathrm{cm}^{2}$  (defects $/{\mathrm{in}}^{2}]$ ).  This equation is based on  Bose-Einstein  statistics and has been found to be a good  predictor of wafer processing performance, especially for highly integrated chips  (VLSI and beyond).  

# Example 33.3  Yield in wafer  processing  

A silicon wafer with a diameter of $200\:\mathrm{mm}$  is processed over a circular area  whose diameter  $=190\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The chips to be fabricated are square with  $10\,\mathrm{mm}$   on a side. From previous experience, the density of point defects in the surface  area is 0.002 defects $/\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ . Determine an estimate of the number of good chips  using the Bose-Einstein yield computation.  

Solution:  $n_{c}=0.34(190/10)^{2.25}=0.34(19)^{2.25}=256$ chips. Processable wafer area  $A=\pi(190)^{2}/4=28{,}353\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}=283.53\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}.$  

$$
Y_{m}={\frac{1}{1+283.53(0.002)}}={\frac{1}{1+0.567}}=0.638=63.8\%
$$  

Number of good chips $=0.638(256)=163.4$  rounded down to  163 good chips .  

Wafer processing is the key to successful fabrication of integrated circuits. For  an IC producer to be proﬁ  table, high yields must be achieved during this phase of  manufacturing. This is accomplished using the purest possible starting materials, the  latest equipment technologies, good process control over the individual processing  steps, maintenance of clean room conditions, and efﬁ  cient and effective inspection  and testing procedures. This section  emphasizes the details that are relevant to PCB fabrication. The discussion proceeds  approximately in the order in which the processes are performed on a board. How- ever, there are differences in processing sequence between different board types,  and these differences are examined in Section 34.2.4. Some of the operations in PCB  fabrication must be performed under clean room conditions to avoid defects in the  printed circuits, especially for boards with ﬁ  ne tracks and details.  

Board Preparation  Initial preparation of the board consists of shearing, hole- making, and other shaping operations to create tabs, slots, and similar features in  the board. If necessary, the starting panel may have to be sheared to size for com- patibility with the circuit fabricator’s equipment. The holes, called tooling holes, are  made by drilling or punching and are used for positioning the board during subse- quent processing. The sequence of fabrication steps requires close alignment from  one process to the next, and these holes are used with locating pins at each operation  to achieve accurate registration. Three tooling holes per board are usually sufﬁ  cient  for this purpose; hole size is about $3.2\:\mathrm{mm}$  (0.125 in), larger than the circuit holes to  be drilled later.  

The board is typically bar coded for identiﬁ  cation purposes in this preparation  phase. Finally, a cleaning process is used to remove dirt and grease from the board  surface. Although cleanliness requirements are not as stringent as in IC fabrication,  small particles of dirt and dust can cause defects in the circuit pattern of a printed  circuit board; and surface ﬁ  lms of grease can inhibit etching and other chemical  processes. Cleanliness is essential for producing reliable PCBs.  

Hole Drilling   In addition to tooling holes, functional circuit holes are required  in PCBs as (1)  insertion holes  for inserting leads of components that are based on  through-hole technology, (2)  via holes , which are later copper-plated and used as  conducting paths from one side of the board to the other, and (3) holes to fasten  certain components such as heat sinks and connectors to the board. These holes  are either drilled or punched, using the tooling holes for location. Cleaner holes  can be produced by drilling, so most holes in PCB fabrication are drilled. A stack  of three or four panels may be drilled in the same operation, using a computer  numerically controlled (CNC) drill press that receives its programming instruc- tions from the design database. For high-production jobs, multiple-spindle drills  are sometimes used, permitting all of the holes in the board to be drilled in one  feed motion.  

Standard twist drills (Section 22.3.2) are used to drill the holes, but the application  makes a number of unusual demands on the drill and drilling equipment. Perhaps the  biggest single problem is the small hole size in printed circuit boards; drill diameter  is generally less than  $1.27\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.050 in), but some high-density boards require hole  sizes of  $0.15~\mathrm{mm}~(0.006~\mathrm{in})$  or even less [8]. Such small drill bits lack strength, and  their capacity to dissipate heat is low.  

Another difﬁ  culty is the unique work material. The drill bit must ﬁ  rst pass  through a thin copper foil and then proceed through an abrasive epoxy-glass com- posite. Different drills would normally be speciﬁ  ed for these materials, but a single  drill must sufﬁ  ce in PCB drilling. Cemented carbide or coated carbide are favored  over high speed steel as the tool material.  

The small hole size, combined with the stacking of several boards or multilayer  boards, result in a high depth-to-diameter ratio, aggravating the problem of chip  extraction from the hole. Other requirements placed on the operation include high  accuracy in hole location, smooth hole walls, and absence of burrs on the holes. Burrs  are usually formed when the drill enters or exits a hole; thin sheets of material are  often placed on top of and beneath the stack of boards to inhibit burr formation on  the boards themselves.  

Finally, any cutting tool must be used at a certain cutting speed to operate at best  efﬁ  ciency. For a drill bit, cutting speed is measured at the diameter.

Identify some of the advantages of surface mount technology over conventional through-hole technology.,"Answer. Advantages of SMT include: (1) smaller components, (2) higher packing densities, (3) components can be mounted on both sides of the board, (4) smaller PCBs are possible for the same function, (5) reduced number of holes drilled in the board, and (6) certain undesirable electrical effects are reduced, such as spurious surface capacitances and inductances.","Surface mount technology (SMT) offers several advantages over traditional through-hole technology:

1. **Higher Component Density**: SMT components can be mounted on both sides of a PCB, effectively doubling the component density compared to through-hole technology. This allows for more complex circuits in smaller spaces.

2. **Smaller Components**: SMT components are typically smaller with shorter leads or no leads, allowing for a more compact circuit design. This reduction in size helps in decreasing the overall footprint of the PCB.

3. **Improved Performance**: With shorter path lengths between components, SMT often leads to better electrical performance due to lower parasitic capacitance and inductance. This improves signal integrity, particularly for high-frequency designs.

4. **Reduced Manufacturing Costs**: SMT eliminates the need for drilling holes, which is required in through-hole technology. This simplification in the manufacturing process can significantly reduce production costs and increase production speed.

5. **Efficient Automated Assembly**: SMT components are better suited for automation, which increases the speed of manufacturing and reduces labor costs. Automated pick-and-place machines can quickly and precisely position components on the PCB.

6. **Enhanced Reliability**: The solder joints in SMT are less prone to mechanical failure, as there are no long leads that may flex or bend. This results in improved reliability under mechanical stress and thermal cycling.

7. **Ease of Updating Designs**: The flexibility to place components on both sides of the PCB and to modify layouts without the constraints of through-hole placements allows for easier updates and redesigns.

While SMT provides numerous advantages, it also presents challenges such as difficulties in manual assembly, inspection, and repair due to the smaller size of components. However, its benefits in terms of density, performance, and cost have made it the dominant technology in PCB assembly.","# Historical Note 34.2  Surface-mount technology  

Printed circuit board assemblies based on through- hole technology were the predominant electronics  packaging method from the 1950s through most of the  1980s, when surface-mount technology (SMT) started  to be widely used.  

SMT traces its origins to the electronic systems  in the aerospace and military industries of the 1960s,  with the IBM Corporation responsible for much of  the original development work. The ﬁ  rst components  were small, ﬂ  at ceramic packages with gull-wing  leads. The initial reason why these packages were  attrac  tive, compared with through-hole technology,  was the fact that they could be placed on both sides  of a printed circuit board—in effect, doubling the com- ponent density. In addition, the SMT package could be  made smaller than a comparable through-hole pack- age, further increasing component densities on the  printed circuit board.  

In the early 1970s, further advances in SMT were  made in the form of leadless components—components  with ceramic packages that had no discrete leads. This  permitted even greater circuit densities in military and  aerospace electronics. In the late 1970s, plastic SMT  packages became available, motivating the widespread  use of surface-mount technology. The computer and  automotive industries have become important users of  SMT , and their demand for SMT components has con- tributed to the signiﬁ  cant growth in this technology.  

Despite its advantages, SMT has not been fully adopted by the electronics industry to  the exclusion of through-hole technology. There are several reasons for this: (1) Owing  to their smaller size, surface mount components are more difﬁ  cult to handle and assem- ble by humans; (2) inspection, testing, and rework of the circuit assemblies are gener- ally more difﬁ  cult in SMT because of the smaller scale involved; and (3) certain types  of components are not available in surface-mount form. This ﬁ  nal limitation results in  some electronic assemblies that contain both surface-mount and leaded components.  

The sequence of steps to produce assembled PCBs is basically the same in SMT and  through-hole technology: (1) place the components on the PCB, (2) solder the compo- nents to the PCB lands, (3) clean the assembly, (4) inspect, (5) test, and (6) rework. The  details of the ﬁ  rst two steps differ for SMT and through-hole technology. The ﬁ  nal four  steps are the same, except that the smaller scale of SMT makes inspection, testing, and  rework more challenging.  

Component placement in SMT means correctly locating the component on the  PCB and afﬁ  xing it sufﬁ  ciently to the surface until soldering provides permanent  mechanical and electrical connections. Two alternative placement and soldering

methods are available: (1) solder paste and reﬂ  ow soldering, and (2) adhesive bond- ing of components and wave soldering. It turns out that certain types of SMT compo- nents are more suited to one method whereas other types are more suited to the  other method.  

Solder Paste and Reﬂ  ow Soldering   The steps in this method are described in  Figure 34.9. A solder paste is used to afﬁ  x components to the surface of the circuit  board. A  solder paste  is a suspension of solder powders in a ﬂ  ux binder. It has three  functions: (1) it is the solder—typically $80\%$  to $90\%$  of total paste volume, (2) it is  the ﬂ  ux, and (3) it is the adhesive that temporarily secures the components to the  surface of the board. Methods of applying the solder paste to the board surface  include screen printing and syringe dispensing. Upper PCB  assembly is through- hole technology  (pin-in-hole) whereas  lower assembly is  mostly surface-mount  technology. (Courtesy  of George E. Kane  Manufacturing  Technology Laboratory,  Lehigh University.)  

The assembled PCBs are, in turn, connected to a chassis or other framework; this  is the  third level of packaging . This third level may consist of a  rack  that holds the  boards, using wire cables to make the interconnections. In major electronic systems,  such as large computers, the PCBs are typically mounted onto a larger printed cir- cuit board called a  back plane , which has conduction paths to permit interconnec- tion between the smaller boards attached to it. This latter conﬁ  guration is known as  card-on-board  (COB) packaging, in which the smaller PCBs are called cards and  the back plane is the board.  

The  fourth level of packaging  consists of wiring and cabling inside the cabinet  that contains the electronic system. For systems of relatively low complexity, the  packaging may not include all of the possible levels in the hierarchy.  

A printed circuit board consists of one or more thin sheets of insulating material,  with thin copper lines on one or both surfaces that interconnect the components  attached to the board. In boards consisting of more than one layer, copper conduct- ing paths are interleaved between the layers. PCBs are used in packaged electronic  systems to hold components, provide electrical interconnections among them, and  make connections to external circuits. They have become standard building blocks  in virtually all electronic systems that contain packaged ICs and other components  (Historical Note 34.1). PCBs are so important and widely used because (1) they  provide a convenient structural platform for the components; (2) a board with cor- rectly routed interconnections can be mass produced consistently, without the varia- bility usually associated with hand wiring; (3) nearly all of the soldering connections  between components and the PCB can be accomplished in a one-step mechanized  

# Historical Note 34.1  Printed circuit boards  

Before printed circuit boards, electrical and electronic  components were manually fastened to a sheet-metal  chassis (usually aluminum) and then hand wired and  soldered to form the desired circuit. This was called  point-to-point construction. In the late 1950s, various  plastic boards became commercially available. These  boards, which provided electrical insulation, gradually  replaced the aluminum chassis.  The ﬁ  rst plastics were  phenolics, followed by glass-ﬁ  ber-reinforced epoxies.  The boards came with predrilled holes spaced at  standard intervals in both directions. This motivated  the use of electronic components that matched these  hole spacings.  The dual-in-line package evolved during  this period.  

The components in these circuit boards were hand- wired, which proved increasingly difﬁ  cult and prone to  human error as component densities increased and cir- cuits became more complex. The printed circuit board,  with etched copper foil on its surface to form the wiring  interconnections, was developed in the 1950s to solve  these problems with manual wiring. The printed circuit  boards during that period used through-hole technology,  and PCBs had to be drilled to accommodate the com- ponent leads. The original technique for “printing” the  circuit pattern onto the copper-clad board was screen  printing. In the late 1980s, surface mount technology  began to replace through-hole construction. SMT did  not require lead holes, and the components were signi- ﬁ  cantly smaller, allowing much higher circuit densities  to be achieved on the printed circuit boards. As track  widths became ﬁ  ner and ﬁ  ner, photolithography was  substituted for screen printing.  

Initial techniques to design the circuit masks involved  a manual inking procedure, in which the designer at- tempted to route the conducting tracks to provide the  required connections and avoid short circuits on a large  sheet of paper or vellum. This became more difﬁ  cult as  the number of components on the board increased and  the conducting lines interconnecting the components  became ﬁ  ner. Computer programs were developed to  aid the designer in solving the routing problem. How- ever, in many cases, it was impossible to ﬁ  nd a solu- tion with no intersecting tracks (short circuits). To solve  the problem, jumper wires were hand-soldered to the  board to make these connections. The setup consists of an array  of probes that are forced under light pressure to make contact with speciﬁ  ed points  on the board surface. Electrical connections between contact points can be quickly  checked in this procedure.  

Several additional processing steps must be performed on the bare board to pre- pare it for assembly. The ﬁ  rst of these ﬁ  nishing operations is the application of a thin  solder layer on the track and land surfaces. This layer serves to protect the copper  from oxidation and contamination. It is carried out either by electroplating or by  bringing the copper side into contact with rotating rollers that are partially sub- mersed in molten solder.  

A second operation involves application of a coating of solder resist to all areas of  the board surface except the lands that are to be subsequently soldered in assembly.  The solder resist coating is chemically formulated to resist adhesion of solder; thus,  in the subsequent soldering processes, solder adheres only to land areas. Solder resist  is usually applied by screen printing.  

Finally, an identiﬁ  cation legend is printed onto the surface, again by screen print- ing. The legend indicates where the different components are to be placed on the  board in ﬁ  nal assembly. In modern industrial practice, a bar code is also printed on  the board for production control purposes.  

#  Printed Circuit Board Assembly  

A printed circuit board assembly consists of electronic components (e.g., IC pack- ages, resistors, capacitors) as well as mechanical components (e.g., fasteners, heat  sinks) mounted on a printed circuit board. This is level 2 in electronic packaging  (Table 34.1). As indicated, PCB assembly is based on either surface-mount techno- logy (SMT) or through-hole technology (see Figure 34.2). Some PCB assemblies  include both SMT and through-hole components. The discussion in this section  covers both categories as well as combinations of the two. The scope of electronic  assembly also includes higher packaging levels such as assemblies of multiple  PCBs electrically connected and mechanically contained in a chassis or cabinet.  Section 34.4 explores the technologies by which electrical connections are made at  these higher levels.  

# 34.3.1  SURFACE MOUNT TECHNOLOGY  

Since the late 1980s, the use of surface mount technology has grown to the point  where it is now the dominant process in printed circuit board assembly. The earlier  through-hole technology has the following inherent limitations in terms of packing  density: (1) components can be mounted on only one side of the board, and (2) center- to-center distance between lead pins in leaded components must be a minimum of  $1.0\:\mathrm{mm}\:(0.04\:\mathrm{in})$  and is usually $2.5\,\mathrm{mm}\,(0.10\,\mathrm{in})$ .  

Surface-mount technology uses an assembly method in which component leads  are soldered to lands on the surface of the board rather than into holes running  through the board (Historical Note 34.2). By eliminating the need for leads inserted  into through holes in the board, several advantages are gained: (1) smaller compo- nents are available, with leads closer together; (2) circuit densities can be increased;  (3) components can be mounted on both sides of the board; (4) smaller PCBs can be  used for the same electronic system; and (5) drilling of the many through holes dur- ing board fabrication is eliminated although via holes to interconnect layers are still  required [6]. Typical areas on the board surface taken by SMT components range  between $20\%$  and $60\%$  compared to through-hole components.

Identify some of the limitations and disadvantages of surface mount technology?,"Answer. Limitations and disadvantages of SMT include: (1) components are more difficult for humans to handle, (2) SMT components are generally more expensive than THT components, (3) inspection, testing, and rework are more difficult, and (4) certain types of components are not available in SMT.","Surface mount technology (SMT) offers significant advantages in terms of compactness and manufacturing efficiency. However, it also has some limitations and disadvantages:

1. **Handling and Assembly Challenges**: SMT components are generally smaller, making them more difficult to handle and assemble manually. This requires specialized automation equipment and tools, increasing initial setup costs and complexity.

2. **Inspection and Testing Difficulties**: Due to their smaller size and higher density, inspecting SMT assemblies for defects can be challenging. Traditional inspection methods might not be suitable, necessitating advanced automated optical inspection (AOI) and other testing technologies, which can increase costs.

3. **Limited Component Availability**: Not all electronic components are available in surface-mount form. Some components must remain in through-hole formats due to their physical size or power requirements, which means that hybrid assemblies (combining SMT and through-hole) may be necessary, complicating the manufacturing process.

4. **Rework and Repair Complexity**: Reworking or repairing SMT components can be more challenging due to their size and density. Specialized equipment and skilled technicians are often needed to address issues without damaging the board or surrounding components.

5. **Thermal and Mechanical Stress**: SMT components may be more susceptible to thermal and mechanical stresses compared to through-hole components, as they rely on solder joints for mechanical stability without the additional support provided by a lead going through the board.

Despite these challenges, SMT remains the dominant technology in modern PCB assemblies due to its ability to produce highly dense and efficient circuits, which are crucial for consumer electronics, computers, and advanced electronic systems.","# Historical Note 34.2  Surface-mount technology

Today, most chip carriers are based on  surface mount technology because it allows greater packing densities to be achieved  in the circuit board assembly.

FIGURE 33.20  Dual in-line package with 16  terminals, shown as a through-hole conﬁ  guration.  

The major styles of IC packages include (1) dual in-line package, (2) square  package, and (3) pin grid array. The  dual in-line package  (DIP) is a common  form of IC package, available in both through-hole and surface-mount conﬁ  gura- tions. It has two rows of leads (terminals) on either side of a rectangular body,  as in Figure 33.20. Spacing between leads (center-to-center distance) in the con- ventional through-hole DIP is  $2.54~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.1 in), and the number of leads ranges  between 8 and 64. Hole spacing in the through-hole DIP style is limited by the  ability to drill holes closely together in a printed circuit board. This limitation can  be relaxed with surface-mount technology because the leads are not inserted into  the board; standard lead spacing on surface-mount DIPs is  $1.27~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.05 in).  

The number of terminals in a DIP is limited by its rectangular shape in which  leads project only from two sides; that means that the number of leads on either side  is $n_{i o}/2$ . For high values of $n_{i o}$  (between 48 and 64), differences in conducting lengths  between leads in the middle of the DIP and those on the ends cause problems in  high-speed electrical characteristics. Some of these problems are addressed with a  square package, in which the leads are arranged around the periphery so that the  number of terminals on a side is $n_{i o}/4.$ . A surface-mount square package is illustrated  in Figure 33.21.  

Even with a square package, there is still a practical upper limit on terminal count  dictated by the manner in which the leads in the package are linearly allocated. The  number of leads on a package can be maximized by using a square matrix of leads.  This chip carrier type is called a  pin grid array  (PGA) in through-hole technology  and a  ball grid array  (BGA) in surface mount. In either case, the package consists  of a two-dimensional array of terminals on the underside of a square chip enclosure.  In the PGA, the terminals are pins that are inserted into through holes in the printed  circuit board, whereas in the BGA, tiny balls of solder replace the pins and are sol- dered directly to copper pads on the PCB. Ideally, the entire bottom surface of the  package is fully occupied by terminals, so that the terminal count in each direction is  square root of $n_{i o}$ . However, as a practical matter, the center area of the package has  no terminals because this region contains the IC chip.  

# 33.6.2  PROCESSING STEPS IN IC PACKAGING  

The packaging of an IC chip in manufacturing can be divided into the following  steps: (1) wafer testing, (2) chip separation, (3) die bonding, (4) wire bonding, and  (5) package sealing. After packaging, a ﬁ  nal functional test is performed on each  packaged IC.

What are the two methods of component placement and soldering in surface mount technology?,"Answer. The two methods are: (1) adhesive bonding and wave soldering, and (2) solder paste and reflow soldering.","The two methods of component placement and soldering in surface mount technology (SMT) are:

1. **Solder Paste and Reflow Soldering:**
   - **Solder Paste Application:** A solder paste, which is a suspension of solder powders in a flux binder, is applied to the PCB lands. This paste acts as the solder, flux, and temporary adhesive.
   - **Component Placement:** Components are placed onto the board, adhering temporarily to the solder paste.
   - **Reflow Soldering:** The assembly is baked, causing the solder paste to reflow and form permanent mechanical and electrical connections between the components and the board.

2. **Adhesive Bonding and Wave Soldering:**
   - **Adhesive Application:** Adhesive is applied to the board surface to hold components in place.
   - **Component Placement:** Components are positioned onto the adhesive-coated areas.
   - **Wave Soldering:** The assembly passes over a wave of molten solder, which creates the necessary solder joints as it contacts the metallized components.

Each method is suited to different types of SMT components and assembly requirements, with solder paste and reflow being generally preferred for finer pitch and higher complexity assemblies.","# Historical Note 34.2  Surface-mount technology  

Printed circuit board assemblies based on through- hole technology were the predominant electronics  packaging method from the 1950s through most of the  1980s, when surface-mount technology (SMT) started  to be widely used.  

SMT traces its origins to the electronic systems  in the aerospace and military industries of the 1960s,  with the IBM Corporation responsible for much of  the original development work. The ﬁ  rst components  were small, ﬂ  at ceramic packages with gull-wing  leads. The initial reason why these packages were  attrac  tive, compared with through-hole technology,  was the fact that they could be placed on both sides  of a printed circuit board—in effect, doubling the com- ponent density. In addition, the SMT package could be  made smaller than a comparable through-hole pack- age, further increasing component densities on the  printed circuit board.  

In the early 1970s, further advances in SMT were  made in the form of leadless components—components  with ceramic packages that had no discrete leads. This  permitted even greater circuit densities in military and  aerospace electronics. In the late 1970s, plastic SMT  packages became available, motivating the widespread  use of surface-mount technology. The computer and  automotive industries have become important users of  SMT , and their demand for SMT components has con- tributed to the signiﬁ  cant growth in this technology.  

Despite its advantages, SMT has not been fully adopted by the electronics industry to  the exclusion of through-hole technology. There are several reasons for this: (1) Owing  to their smaller size, surface mount components are more difﬁ  cult to handle and assem- ble by humans; (2) inspection, testing, and rework of the circuit assemblies are gener- ally more difﬁ  cult in SMT because of the smaller scale involved; and (3) certain types  of components are not available in surface-mount form. This ﬁ  nal limitation results in  some electronic assemblies that contain both surface-mount and leaded components.  

The sequence of steps to produce assembled PCBs is basically the same in SMT and  through-hole technology: (1) place the components on the PCB, (2) solder the compo- nents to the PCB lands, (3) clean the assembly, (4) inspect, (5) test, and (6) rework. The  details of the ﬁ  rst two steps differ for SMT and through-hole technology. The ﬁ  nal four  steps are the same, except that the smaller scale of SMT makes inspection, testing, and  rework more challenging.  

Component placement in SMT means correctly locating the component on the  PCB and afﬁ  xing it sufﬁ  ciently to the surface until soldering provides permanent  mechanical and electrical connections. Two alternative placement and soldering

methods are available: (1) solder paste and reﬂ  ow soldering, and (2) adhesive bond- ing of components and wave soldering. It turns out that certain types of SMT compo- nents are more suited to one method whereas other types are more suited to the  other method.  

Solder Paste and Reﬂ  ow Soldering   The steps in this method are described in  Figure 34.9. A solder paste is used to afﬁ  x components to the surface of the circuit  board. A  solder paste  is a suspension of solder powders in a ﬂ  ux binder. It has three  functions: (1) it is the solder—typically $80\%$  to $90\%$  of total paste volume, (2) it is  the ﬂ  ux, and (3) it is the adhesive that temporarily secures the components to the  surface of the board. Methods of applying the solder paste to the board surface  include screen printing and syringe dispensing. The setup consists of an array  of probes that are forced under light pressure to make contact with speciﬁ  ed points  on the board surface. Electrical connections between contact points can be quickly  checked in this procedure.  

Several additional processing steps must be performed on the bare board to pre- pare it for assembly. The ﬁ  rst of these ﬁ  nishing operations is the application of a thin  solder layer on the track and land surfaces. This layer serves to protect the copper  from oxidation and contamination. It is carried out either by electroplating or by  bringing the copper side into contact with rotating rollers that are partially sub- mersed in molten solder.  

A second operation involves application of a coating of solder resist to all areas of  the board surface except the lands that are to be subsequently soldered in assembly.  The solder resist coating is chemically formulated to resist adhesion of solder; thus,  in the subsequent soldering processes, solder adheres only to land areas. Solder resist  is usually applied by screen printing.  

Finally, an identiﬁ  cation legend is printed onto the surface, again by screen print- ing. The legend indicates where the different components are to be placed on the  board in ﬁ  nal assembly. In modern industrial practice, a bar code is also printed on  the board for production control purposes.  

#  Printed Circuit Board Assembly  

A printed circuit board assembly consists of electronic components (e.g., IC pack- ages, resistors, capacitors) as well as mechanical components (e.g., fasteners, heat  sinks) mounted on a printed circuit board. This is level 2 in electronic packaging  (Table 34.1). As indicated, PCB assembly is based on either surface-mount techno- logy (SMT) or through-hole technology (see Figure 34.2). Some PCB assemblies  include both SMT and through-hole components. The discussion in this section  covers both categories as well as combinations of the two. The scope of electronic  assembly also includes higher packaging levels such as assemblies of multiple  PCBs electrically connected and mechanically contained in a chassis or cabinet.  Section 34.4 explores the technologies by which electrical connections are made at  these higher levels.  

# 34.3.1  SURFACE MOUNT TECHNOLOGY  

Since the late 1980s, the use of surface mount technology has grown to the point  where it is now the dominant process in printed circuit board assembly. The earlier  through-hole technology has the following inherent limitations in terms of packing  density: (1) components can be mounted on only one side of the board, and (2) center- to-center distance between lead pins in leaded components must be a minimum of  $1.0\:\mathrm{mm}\:(0.04\:\mathrm{in})$  and is usually $2.5\,\mathrm{mm}\,(0.10\,\mathrm{in})$ .  

Surface-mount technology uses an assembly method in which component leads  are soldered to lands on the surface of the board rather than into holes running  through the board (Historical Note 34.2). By eliminating the need for leads inserted  into through holes in the board, several advantages are gained: (1) smaller compo- nents are available, with leads closer together; (2) circuit densities can be increased;  (3) components can be mounted on both sides of the board; (4) smaller PCBs can be  used for the same electronic system; and (5) drilling of the many through holes dur- ing board fabrication is eliminated although via holes to interconnect layers are still  required [6]. Typical areas on the board surface taken by SMT components range  between $20\%$  and $60\%$  compared to through-hole components.  

# Historical Note 34.2  Surface-mount technology  

Printed circuit board assemblies based on through- hole technology were the predominant electronics  packaging method from the 1950s through most of the  1980s, when surface-mount technology (SMT) started  to be widely used.

Several lead conﬁ  gurations are available in SMT, as  illustrated in (b), (c), and (d) of the ﬁ  gure. Today, most chip carriers are based on  surface mount technology because it allows greater packing densities to be achieved  in the circuit board assembly.

FIGURE 33.20  Dual in-line package with 16  terminals, shown as a through-hole conﬁ  guration.  

The major styles of IC packages include (1) dual in-line package, (2) square  package, and (3) pin grid array. The  dual in-line package  (DIP) is a common  form of IC package, available in both through-hole and surface-mount conﬁ  gura- tions. It has two rows of leads (terminals) on either side of a rectangular body,  as in Figure 33.20. Spacing between leads (center-to-center distance) in the con- ventional through-hole DIP is  $2.54~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.1 in), and the number of leads ranges  between 8 and 64. Hole spacing in the through-hole DIP style is limited by the  ability to drill holes closely together in a printed circuit board. This limitation can  be relaxed with surface-mount technology because the leads are not inserted into  the board; standard lead spacing on surface-mount DIPs is  $1.27~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.05 in).  

The number of terminals in a DIP is limited by its rectangular shape in which  leads project only from two sides; that means that the number of leads on either side  is $n_{i o}/2$ . For high values of $n_{i o}$  (between 48 and 64), differences in conducting lengths  between leads in the middle of the DIP and those on the ends cause problems in  high-speed electrical characteristics. Some of these problems are addressed with a  square package, in which the leads are arranged around the periphery so that the  number of terminals on a side is $n_{i o}/4.$ . A surface-mount square package is illustrated  in Figure 33.21.  

Even with a square package, there is still a practical upper limit on terminal count  dictated by the manner in which the leads in the package are linearly allocated. The  number of leads on a package can be maximized by using a square matrix of leads.  This chip carrier type is called a  pin grid array  (PGA) in through-hole technology  and a  ball grid array  (BGA) in surface mount. In either case, the package consists  of a two-dimensional array of terminals on the underside of a square chip enclosure.  In the PGA, the terminals are pins that are inserted into through holes in the printed  circuit board, whereas in the BGA, tiny balls of solder replace the pins and are sol- dered directly to copper pads on the PCB. Ideally, the entire bottom surface of the  package is fully occupied by terminals, so that the terminal count in each direction is  square root of $n_{i o}$ . However, as a practical matter, the center area of the package has  no terminals because this region contains the IC chip.  

# 33.6.2  PROCESSING STEPS IN IC PACKAGING  

The packaging of an IC chip in manufacturing can be divided into the following  steps: (1) wafer testing, (2) chip separation, (3) die bonding, (4) wire bonding, and  (5) package sealing. After packaging, a ﬁ  nal functional test is performed on each  packaged IC.  

Wafer Testing   Current semiconductor processing techniques provide many  indivi  dual ICs per wafer. It is convenient to perform certain functional tests on  the ICs while they are still together on the wafer—before chip separation.

What is a solder paste?,Answer. A solder paste is a suspension of solder powders in a flux binder. The flux binder includes an adhesive that attaches the SMT components to the board surface. The solder constitutes about 85% of the total volume of the paste.,"A solder paste is a material used in the assembly of electronic components onto printed circuit boards (PCBs) in surface-mount technology (SMT). It is a suspension of solder powder particles in a flux binder, typically making up 80% to 90% of the total paste volume. The solder paste performs three key functions:

1. **Solder**: The paste contains solder, which is the metal that will form the conductive joints upon melting. It ensures a strong, electrically conductive connection between the components and the PCB.

2. **Flux**: Acting as a flux, the binder helps in cleaning the metal surfaces, removing any oxides or impurities that may prevent proper soldering. It ensures good wetting and adhesion when the solder melts.

3. **Adhesive**: Before the soldering process, the paste acts as a temporary adhesive, holding the components in place on the PCB until the solder reflow process is completed. This temporary adhesion is crucial during the automated placement of components.

The paste’s properties, such as viscosity, are carefully controlled to ensure it can be applied accurately to the board using methods like screen printing or syringe dispensing. It should neither flow uncontrollably nor spread beyond the intended areas.

In summary, solder paste is essential in SMT for establishing mechanical and electrical connections by facilitating the placement and soldering of components onto PCBs.","It turns out that certain types of SMT compo- nents are more suited to one method whereas other types are more suited to the  other method.  

Solder Paste and Reﬂ  ow Soldering   The steps in this method are described in  Figure 34.9. A solder paste is used to afﬁ  x components to the surface of the circuit  board. A  solder paste  is a suspension of solder powders in a ﬂ  ux binder. It has three  functions: (1) it is the solder—typically $80\%$  to $90\%$  of total paste volume, (2) it is  the ﬂ  ux, and (3) it is the adhesive that temporarily secures the components to the  surface of the board. Methods of applying the solder paste to the board surface  include screen printing and syringe dispensing. Properties of the paste must be com- patible with these application methods; the paste must ﬂ  ow yet not be so liquid that  it spreads beyond the localized area where it is applied.  

After solder paste application, the components are placed onto the board surface  by automated placement machines or semiautomatic placement machines. The auto- matic machines operate under computer numerical control (Section 37.3). Compo- nents (e.g., chip carriers, capacitors, resistors) to be placed are usually supplied in  magazines or attached to tape in reels that can be loaded into feeders on the auto- mated machines. The starting blank PCB is moved and positioned under the pick- and-place work head that places the components at speciﬁ  ed locations on the board  using a high-speed  $x$ - y  positioning system. The work head uses suction nozzles to  retrieve and handle components. Automated machines operate at cycle rates of up  to 30,000 components per hour [20]. For mass production, they are frequently inte- grated into production lines, so that most or all of the processes performed on the  board during assembly are completed in one automated sequence.  

The semiautomatic machines assist a worker in the placement operation using a  high-resolution vision system. Components to be placed are presented to the opera- tor in the correct placement sequence by a turret mechanism, and then the operator  picks the component and is guided by the vision monitor to place it at the target

location on the board. Cycle rates of 1,000 components per hour are claimed for  some semiautomatic machines [15].  

After all components are placed on the board, a low-temperature baking opera- tion is performed to dry the ﬂ  ux binder; this reduces gas escape during soldering.  Finally, the solder reﬂ  ow process (Section 30.2.3) heats the solder paste sufﬁ  ciently  that the solder particles melt to form a high-quality mechanical and electrical joint  between the component leads and the circuit lands on the board.  

Adhesive Bonding and Wave Soldering  The sequence of steps is depicted in  Figure 34.10. Various adhesives (Section 30.3) are used for afﬁ  xing components to  the board surface. Most common are epoxies and acrylics. The adhesive is applied by  one of three methods: (1) brushing liquid adhesive through a screen stencil; (2) using  an automatic dispensing machine with a programmable  $x$ - y  positioning system; or  (3) using a pin transfer method, in which a ﬁ  xture consisting of pins arranged accord- ing to where adhesive must be applied is dipped into the liquid adhesive and then  positioned onto the board surface to deposit adhesive in the required spots.  

Components are placed on the board by the same type of placement machines used  with the solder paste assembly method. After component placement, the adhesive  is cured. # Historical Note 34.2  Surface-mount technology

Unfortunately, there is no single ﬂ  ux  that serves all of these functions perfectly for all combinations of solder and base  metals. The ﬂ  ux formulation must be selected for a given application.  

Soldering ﬂ  uxes can be classiﬁ  ed as organic or inorganic.  Organic ﬂ  uxes  are made  of either rosin (i.e., natural rosin such as gum wood, which is not water-soluble) or  water-soluble ingredients (e.g., alcohols, organic acids, and halogenated salts). The  water-soluble type facilitates cleanup after soldering. Organic ﬂ  uxes are most com- monly used for electrical and electronics connections. They tend to be chemically  reactive at elevated soldering temperatures but relatively noncorrosive at room  temperatures.  Inorganic ﬂ  uxes  consist of inorganic acids (e.g., muriatic acid) and  salts (e.g., combinations of zinc and ammonium chlorides) and are used to achieve  rapid and active ﬂ  uxing where oxide ﬁ  lms are a problem. The salts become active  when melted, but are less corrosive than the acids. When solder wire is purchased  with an  acid core  it is in this category.  

Both organic and inorganic ﬂ  uxes should be removed after soldering, but it is  especially important in the case of inorganic acids to prevent continued corrosion  of the metal surfaces. Flux removal is usually accomplished using water solutions  except in the case of rosins, which require chemical solvents. Recent trends in indus- try favor water-soluble ﬂ  uxes over rosins because chemical solvents used with rosins  are harmful to the environment and to humans.  

# 30.2.3  SOLDERING METHODS  

Many of the methods used in soldering are the same as those used in brazing, except  that less heat and lower temperatures are required for soldering. These methods  include torch soldering, furnace soldering, induction soldering, resistance soldering,  dip soldering, and infrared soldering. There are other soldering methods, not used  in brazing, that should be described here. These methods are hand soldering, wave  soldering, and reﬂ  ow soldering.  

Hand Soldering   Hand soldering is performed manually using a hot soldering  iron. A  bit , made of copper, is the working end of a soldering iron. Its functions are  (1) to deliver heat to the parts being soldered, (2) to melt the solder, (3) to convey  molten solder to the joint, and (4) to withdraw excess solder. Most modern soldering  irons are heated by electrical resistance. Some are designed as fast-heating  soldering  guns , which are popular in electronics assembly for intermittent (on-off) operation  actuated by a trigger. They are capable of making a solder joint in about a second.  

Wave Soldering   Wave soldering is a mechanized technique that allows multiple  lead wires to be soldered to a printed circuit board (PCB) as it passes over a wave  of molten solder. The typical setup is one in which a PCB, on which electronic com- ponents have been placed with their lead wires extending through the holes in the  board, is loaded onto a conveyor for transport through the wave-soldering equip- ment. The conveyor supports the PCB on its sides, so that its underside is exposed  to the processing steps, which consist of the following: (1) ﬂ  ux is applied using any  of several methods, including foaming, spraying, or brushing; (2) preheating (using  light bulbs, heating coils, and infrared devices) to evaporate solvents, activate the  ﬂ  ux, and raise the temperature of the assembly; and (3) wave soldering, in which  the liquid solder is pumped from a molten bath through a slit onto the bottom of  the board to make the soldering connections between the lead wires and the metal  circuit on the board. This third step is illustrated in Figure 30.9.

1. **Soldering**: This is the most widely used method in electronics. It involves melting a filler metal (solder) to join components together. Soldering provides a strong, conductive, and permanent connection. It is commonly used in assembling printed circuit boards (PCBs) where reliability and durability are essential.

2. **Pressure Connections**: These involve mechanical forces to establish electrical contact between components. Pressure connections can be further divided into:
   - **Permanent connections**: Such as crimping, press-fit technology, and insulation displacement, where high-pressure contact and mechanical deformation create a stable connection.
   - **Separable connections**: Designed for repeated disassembly and reassembly, maintaining high reliability and low electrical resistance through mechanical mechanisms like clips or sockets.

Each method has its own applications and advantages based on factors such as permanence, ease of connection, and the specific requirements of the electronic system.","These tasks are manual operations, requir- ing skilled workers using soldering irons. Rework of surface-mount assemblies is  more difﬁ  cult than in conventional PIH assemblies, again because of the smaller  component sizes. Special tools are required, such as small-bit soldering irons, magni- fying devices, and instruments for grasping and manipulating the small parts.  

#  Electrical Connector Technology  

PCB assemblies must be connected to back planes, and into racks and cabinets, and  these cabinets must be connected to other cabinets and systems by means of cables.  The growing use of electronics in so many types of products has made electrical  connections an important technology. The performance of any electronic system  depends on the reliability of the individual connections linking the components of  the system together. This section is concerned with connector technology that is  usually applied at the third and higher levels of electronics packaging.  

To begin, there are two basic methods of making electrical connections: (1) solder- ing and (2) pressure connections. Soldering was discussed in Section 30.2 and through- out the current chapter. It is the most widely used technology in electronics.  Pressure  connections  are electrical connections in which mechanical forces are used to estab- lish electrical continuity between components. They can be divided into two types:  permanent and separable.  

# 34.4.1  PERMANENT CONNECTIONS  

A permanent connection involves high-pressure contact between two metal sur- faces, in which one or both parts are mechanically deformed during the assembly  process. Permanent connection methods include crimping, press ﬁ  t technology, and  insulation displacement.  

Crimping of Connector Terminals  This connection method is used to assemble  wire to electrical terminals. Although assembly of the wire to the terminal forms a  permanent joint, the terminal itself is designed to be connected and disconnected  to its mating component. There are a variety of terminal styles, some of which are  shown in Figure 34.14, and they are available in various sizes. They all must be con- nected to conductor wire, and crimping is the operation for doing this.  Crimping involves the mechanical deformation of the terminal barrel to form a permanent  connection with the stripped end of a wire inserted into it. The crimping operation  squeezes and closes the barrel around the bare wire. Crimping is performed by hand  tools or crimping machines. The terminals are supplied either as individual pieces or  on long strips that can be fed into a crimping machine. Properly accomplished, the  crimped joint will have low electrical resistance and high mechanical strength.

FIGURE 34.15  Two types of  terminal pins in electronics  press ﬁ  t technology: (a) solid  and (b) compliant.  

Press Fit Technology  Press ﬁ  t in electrical connections is similar to that in mechani- cal assembly, but the part conﬁ  gurations are different. Press ﬁ  t technology is widely  used in the electronics industry to assemble terminal pins into metal-plated through- holes in large PCBs. In that context, a  press ﬁ  t  involves an interference ﬁ  t between  the terminal pin and the plated hole into which it has been inserted. There are two  categories of terminal pins: (a) solid and (b) compliant, as in Figure 34.15. Within these  categories, pin designs vary among suppliers. The solid pin is rectangular in cross sec- tion and is designed so that its corners press and even cut into the metal of the plated  hole to form a good electrical connection. The compliant pin is designed as a spring- loaded device that conforms to the hole contour but presses against the walls of the  hole to achieve electrical contact. Some  of the principal connector types are cable connectors, terminal blocks, sockets, and  connectors with low or zero insertion force.  

Cable connectors  are devices that are permanently connected to cables (one or  both ends) and are designed to be plugged into and unplugged from a mating con- nector. A power cord connector that plugs into a wall receptacle is a familiar example.  Other styles include the type of multiple pin connector and mating receptacle shown  in Figure 34.17, used to provide signal transmission between electronic subassem- blies. Other multiple pin connector styles are used to attach printed circuit boards to  other subassemblies in the electronic system.  

Terminal blocks  consist of a series of evenly spaced receptacles that allow connec- tions between individual terminals or wires. The terminals or wires are often attached  to the block by means of screws or other mechanical fastening mechanisms to permit  disassembly. A conventional terminal block is illustrated in Figure 34.18.  

A  socket  in electronics refers to a connection device mounted to a PCB, into  which IC packages and other components can be inserted. Sockets are permanently  attached to the PCB by soldering and/or press ﬁ  tting, but they provide a separable  connection method for the components, which can be conveniently added, removed,  or replaced in the PCB assembly. Sockets are therefore an alternative to soldering  in electronics packaging. Press ﬁ  t technology is widely  used in the electronics industry to assemble terminal pins into metal-plated through- holes in large PCBs. In that context, a  press ﬁ  t  involves an interference ﬁ  t between  the terminal pin and the plated hole into which it has been inserted. There are two  categories of terminal pins: (a) solid and (b) compliant, as in Figure 34.15. Within these  categories, pin designs vary among suppliers. The solid pin is rectangular in cross sec- tion and is designed so that its corners press and even cut into the metal of the plated  hole to form a good electrical connection. The compliant pin is designed as a spring- loaded device that conforms to the hole contour but presses against the walls of the  hole to achieve electrical contact.  

Insulation Displacement   Insulation displacement is a method of making a perma- nent electrical connection in which a sharp, prong-shaped contact pierces the insulation  and squeezes against the wire conductor to form an electrical connection. The method  is illustrated in Figure 34.16 and is commonly used to make simultaneous connections  between multiple contacts and ﬂ  at cable. The ﬂ  at cable, called  ribbon cable , consists of  a number of parallel wires held in a ﬁ  xed arrangement by the insula  tion surrounding  them. It is often terminated in multiple pin connectors that are widely used in elec- tronics to make electrical connections between major subassemblies. In these applica- tions, the insulation displacement method reduces wiring errors and speeds harness  assembly. To make the assembly, the cable is placed in a nest and a press is used to drive  the connector contacts through the insulation and against the metal wires.

# 34.4.2  SEPARABLE CONNECTORS  

Separable connections are designed to permit disassembly and reassembly; they are  meant to be connected and disconnected multiple times. When connected they must  provide metal-to-metal contact between mating components with high reliability and  low electrical resistance. Separable connection devices typically consist of multiple  contacts, contained in a plastic molded housing, designed to mate with a compatible  connector or individual wires or terminals. They are used for making electrical connec- tions between various combinations of cables, printed circuit boards, components, and  individual wires.  

A wide selection of connectors is available to serve many different applications.  The design issues in choosing among them include (1) power level (e.g., whether the  connector is used for power or signal transmission); (2) cost; (3) number of individual  conductors involved; (4) types of devices and circuits to be connected; (5) space limita- tions; (6) ease of joining the connector to its leads; (7) ease of connecting with the mat- ing terminal or connector; and (8) frequency of connection and disconnection. Some  of the principal connector types are cable connectors, terminal blocks, sockets, and  connectors with low or zero insertion force.

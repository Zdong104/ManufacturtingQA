We have classified glass as a ceramic material; yet glass is different from the traditional and new ceramics. What is the difference?,"Answer. Glass is vitreous - it is in the glassy state, whereas traditional and new ceramics are, by and large, polycrystalline materials.","Glass is classified as a ceramic material, but it differs from traditional and new ceramics primarily in its structure and properties.

1. **Structure:**
   - **Glass** is amorphous, meaning it has a non-crystalline structure. This lack of long-range order arises because, during cooling, glass bypasses the crystallization process that typically forms in traditional ceramics.
   - **Traditional Ceramics** and **New Ceramics** are generally crystalline. They possess a regular, repeating lattice structure which can contribute to characteristics like brittleness and distinct cleavage planes.

2. **Processing:**
   - **Glass** is processed in the liquid state, which allows for shaping before it solidifies into an amorphous solid. This makes it easier to shape and form glass products compared to traditional ceramics.
   - **Traditional Ceramics** often involve powder processing techniques like sintering. These methods typically require additional steps like mold pressing and high-temperature firing to achieve the final product form.

3. **Properties:**
   - **Glass** has unique optical properties, such as transparency and the capability to transmit light without significant absorption or scattering, which is essential for applications like windows and optical fibers.
   - **Traditional and New Ceramics** are typically used for their mechanical properties like high hardness, thermal stability, and resistance to chemical corrosion. They are not generally transparent due to their crystalline nature.

4. **Applications:**
   - **Glass** is used in applications where its optical properties, smooth surfaces, and ability to be molded into complex shapes are advantageous.
   - **Ceramics** find their applications in areas requiring high strength, wear resistance, and temperature endurance, such as in aerospace components, cutting tools, and electronic substrates.

The distinctions between glass and ceramics highlight the diversity and specialization in materials engineering, each suited to particular applications based on their unique properties.","Another glass fiber material is S- glass, which has higher strength but is not as economical as E-glass. Compositions are  indicated in the table.  

Insulating fiberglass wool can be manufactured from regular soda-lime-silica  glasses. The glass product for fiber optics consists of a long, continuous core of glass  with high refractive index surrounded by a sheath of lower refractive glass. The in-  side glass must have a very high transmittance for light in order to accomplish long  distance communication.  

Optical Glasses  Applications for these glasses include lenses for eyeglasses and  optical instruments such as cameras, microscopes, and telescopes. To achieve their  function, the glasses must have different refractive indices, but each lens must be  homogenous in composition. Optical glasses are generally divided into: crowns and  flints.  Crown glass  has a low index of refraction, while  flint glass  contains lead oxide  (PbO) that gives it a high index of refraction.  

# 7.4.3  GLASS- CERAMICS  

Glass-ceramics are a class of ceramic material produced by conversion of glass into   a  polycrystalline structure through heat treatment. The proportion of crystalline phase  in the final product typically ranges between $90\%$  and $98\%$ , with the remain- der being  unconverted vitreous material. Grain size is usually between 0.1 and  $1.0\ m\mathrm{m}$  (4 and 40  $m$ -in), significantly smaller than the grain size of conventional ceramics. This fine  crystal microstructure makes glass-ceramics much stronger than the glasses from  which they are derived. Also, due to their crystal structure, glass-ceramics are opaque  (usually gray or white) rather than clear.  

The processing sequence for glass-ceramics is as follows: (1) The first step in-  volves heating and forming operations used in glassworking (Section 12.2) to create  the desired product geometry. Glass shaping methods are generally more economi- cal  than pressing and sintering to shape traditional and new ceramics made from powders.  (2) The product is cooled. (3) The glass is reheated to a temperature suf- ficient to cause  a dense network of crystal nuclei to form throughout the material. It is the high density  of nucleation sites that inhibits grain growth of individual crystals, thus leading  ultimately to the fine grain size in the glass-ceramic material. The key to the propensity  for nucleation is the presence of small amounts of nucleating agents in the glass  composition. Common nucleating agents are  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ ,  $\mathrm{P}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{5}$ , and  $\mathrm{ZrO}_{2}$ . (4) Once  nucleation is initiated, the heat treatment is continued at a higher temperature to cause  growth of the crystalline phases.  

Several examples of glass-ceramic systems and typical compositions are listed  in Table 7.5. The  $\mathrm{Li}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{-}\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\mathrm{-}\mathrm{SiO}$ 2  system is the most important commercially; it  includes Corning Ware (Pyroceram), the familiar product of the Corning Glass Works.

The significant advantages of glass-ceramics include (1) efficiency of processing  in the glassy state, (2) close dimensional control over the final product shape, and (3)  good  mechanical and physical properties. Properties include high strength (stronger than  glass), absence of porosity, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and high re-  sistance to thermal shock. These properties have resulted in applications in cooking  ware, heat exchangers, and missile radomes. Certain systems (e.g.,  $\mathrm{MgO-Al_{2}O_{3}-S i O}$ 2 system) are also characterized by high electrical resistance, suitable for electrical  and electronics applications.

# Some   Important   Elements   Related   to   Ceramics  

In this section, several elements of engineering importance are discussed: carbon,  silicon, and boron. These materials are encountered occasionally in subsequent  chapters. Although they are not ceramic materials according to the definition, they  sometimes compete for applications with ceramics. And they have important appli-  cations of their own. Basic data on these elements are presented in Table 7.6.  

# 7.5.1  CARBON  

Carbon occurs in two alternative forms of engineering and commercial impor-  tance: graphite and diamond. They compete with ceramics in various applications:  graphite  in situations where its refractory properties are important, and diamond

in industrial applications where hardness is the critical factor (such as cutting and  grinding tools).  

Graphite  Graphite has a high content of crystalline carbon in the form of layers.  Bonding between atoms in the layers is covalent and therefore strong, but the par-  allel layers are bonded to each other by weak van der Waals forces. This structure  makes graphite quite anisotropic; strength and other properties vary significantly  with direction. It explains why graphite can be used both as a lubricant and as a fiber  in advanced composite materials. In powder form, graphite possesses low frictional  characteristics due to the ease with which it shears between the layers; in this form,  graphite is valued as a lubricant. In fiber form, graphite is oriented in the hexagonal  planar direction to produce a filament material of very high strength and elastic  modulus. These graphite fibers are used in structural composites ranging from tennis  rackets to fighter aircraft components.  

Graphite exhibits certain high temperature properties that are both useful and  unusual. It is resistant to thermal shock, and its strength actually increases with tem-  perature. Tensile strength at room temperature is about  $100\;\mathrm{MPa}$   $\{15{,}000\ 1{\tt b}/\mathrm{in}^{2}\}$ ), but  increases to about twice this value at $2500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(4500^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  [5].  Theoretical density of carbon  is $2.22~\mathrm{gm}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , but apparent density of bulk graphite is lower due to porosity (around  $1.7\;\mathrm{{gm}/\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}}$ ).  This is increased through compacting and heating. It is electrically conduc-  tive, but its conductivity is not as high as most metals.  A disadvantage of graphite is that  it oxidizes in air above around $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(900^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ). In a reducing atmosphere it can be used  up to around $3000^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(5400^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ), not far below its sublimation point of $3727^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(6740^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  

The traditional form of graphite is polycrystalline with a certain amount of amor-  phous carbon in the mixture.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/Sec7.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/Sec7.txt","0.8530932875287468, 0.8493914180091175"
What is the predominant chemical compound in almost all glass products?,Answer. Silica - SiO2.,"The predominant chemical compound in almost all glass products is silica (SiO₂). As shown in the table, silica is the major component in various types of glass such as soda-lime glass (71-73%), window glass (72%), container glass (72%), light bulb glass (73%), and laboratory glass like Pyrex (81%) and Vycor (96%). Silica serves as the primary glass former and is essential because it naturally forms a glassy state upon cooling, unlike most ceramics that crystallize. Its properties, like low thermal expansion and resistance to thermal shock, make it ideal for glass manufacturing.","Other simple tools  rigidity had been attained in the product, a cup-shaped were utilized to add the stem and/or base to the object.  vessel.

A blob of hot glass in the required initial mass-produced glass products such as bottles and   shape and viscosity was attached to the end of the iron  light bulbs (Chapter 12).  

# 7.4.1 CHEMISTRY AND PROPERTIES OF GLASS  

The principal ingredient in virtually all glasses is  silica  $(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ ), most commonly found  as the mineral quartz in sandstone and silica sand. Quartz occurs naturally as a crys-  talline substance; but when melted and then cooled, it forms vitreous silica. Silica glass  has a very low thermal expansion coefficient and is therefore quite resistant to  thermal shock. These properties are ideal for elevated temperature applications;  accordingly, Pyrex and chemical glassware designed for heating are made with high  proportions of silica glass.  

In order to reduce the melting point of glass for easier processing, and to con-  trol properties, the composition of most commercial glasses includes other oxides  as well as silica. Silica remains as the main component in these glass products, usu-  ally comprising  $50\%$  to  $75\%$  of total chemistry. The reason  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  is used so widely  in these compositions is because it is the best  glass former . It naturally transforms into  a glassy state upon cooling from the liquid, whereas most ceramics crystallize upon  solidification. Table 7.4 lists typical chemistries for some common glasses. The  additional ingredients are contained in a solid solution with  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ , and each has a  function: (1) acting as flux (promoting fusion) during heating; (2) increasing fluidity  in the molten glass for processing; (3) retarding  devitrification —the tendency to  crystallize from the glassy state; (4) reducing thermal expansion in the final product;   (5) improving the chemical resistance against attack by acids, basic substances, or  water; (6) adding color to the glass; and (7) altering the index of refraction for opti-  cal applications (e.g., lenses).  

# 7.4.2  GLASS  PRODUCTS  

Following is a list of the major categories of glass products. The roles played by the  different ingredients are examined in Table 7.4 as these products are discussed.  

Window Glass  This glass is represented by two chemistries in Table 7.4: (1) soda-  lime glass and (2) window glass. The soda-lime formula dates back to the glass-blow-  ing industry of the 1800s and earlier. It was (and is) made by mixing soda  $\mathrm{(Na_{2}O)}$  and  lime (CaO) with silica $\left(\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\right)$  as the major ingredient. The blending of ingredients has  evolved empirically to achieve a balance between avoiding crystallization during

cooling and achieving chemical durability of the final product. Modern window glass  and the techniques for making it have required slight adjustments in composition  and closer control over its variation. Magnesia  $\mathrm{(MgO)}$ ) has been added to help re- duce  devitrification.  

Containers  In previous times, the same basic soda-lime composition was used for  manual glass-blowing to make bottles and other containers. Modern processes for  shaping glass containers cool the glass more rapidly than older methods. Also, the  importance of chemical stability in container glass is better understood today. Re-  sulting changes in composition have attempted to optimize the proportions of lime  (CaO) and soda  $\left(\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$ . Lime promotes fluidity. It also increases devitrification,  but since cooling is more rapid, this effect is not as important as in prior processing  techniques with slower cooling rates. Soda reduces chemical instability and solubil- ity  of the container glass.  

Light Bulb Glass   Glass used in light bulbs and other thin glass items (e.g., drinking  glasses, Christmas ornaments) is high in soda and low in lime; it also contains small  amounts of magnesia and alumina. The chemistry is dictated largely by the econom-  ics of large volumes involved in light bulb manufacture. The raw materials are inex-  pensive and suited to the continuous melting furnaces used today.  

Laboratory Glassware  These products include containers for chemicals (e.g.,  flasks, beakers, glass tubing). The glass must be resistant to chemical attack and ther-  mal shock. Glass that is high in silica is suitable because of its low thermal expan-  sion. The trade name “Vicor” is used for this high-silica glass. This product is very  insoluble in water and acids. Additions of boric oxide also produce a glass with low  coefficient of thermal expansion, so some glass for laboratory ware contains  $\mathrm{B}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$  in  amounts of around  $13\%$ . The trade name “Pyrex” is used for the borosilicate glass   developed by the Corning Glass Works. Both Vicor and Pyrex are included in the  listing as examples of this product category.  

Glass Fibers  Glass fibers are manufactured for a number of important applica- tions,  including fiberglass reinforced plastics, insulation wool, and fiber optics. The  compositions vary according to function. The most commonly used glass reinforcing  fibers in plastics are E-glass. It is high in CaO and ${\mathrm{Al}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$  content, it is economical, and  it possesses good tensile strength in fiber form. Another glass fiber material is S- glass, which has higher strength but is not as economical as E-glass. Compositions are  indicated in the table.  

Insulating fiberglass wool can be manufactured from regular soda-lime-silica  glasses. The glass product for fiber optics consists of a long, continuous core of glass  with high refractive index surrounded by a sheath of lower refractive glass. The in-  side glass must have a very high transmittance for light in order to accomplish long  distance communication.  

Optical Glasses  Applications for these glasses include lenses for eyeglasses and  optical instruments such as cameras, microscopes, and telescopes. To achieve their  function, the glasses must have different refractive indices, but each lens must be  homogenous in composition. Optical glasses are generally divided into: crowns and  flints.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/Sec7.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/Sec7.txt","0.8537064784150148, 0.8535154716492577"
What are the three basic steps in the glassworking sequence?,"Answer. (1) raw materials preparation and melting, (2) shaping, and (3) heat treatment. Finishing operations (e.g., grinding, polishing, etching) are performed on some glass products, if needed.","The three basic steps in the glassworking sequence are:

1. **Preparation of Raw Materials and Melting**: This involves cleaning and classifying sand and other additives like soda ash, limestone, and recycled glass to prepare the charge. The mixture is melted in furnaces such as pot furnaces, day tanks, continuous tank furnaces, or electric furnaces to form a viscous molten glass.

2. **Shaping**: The molten glass is shaped into desired forms through various processes such as casting, pressing, or blowing. These methods accommodate different products like flat glass, containers, and specialty items. Shaping can involve methods like press-and-blow for wide-mouth containers or blow-and-blow for narrower bottles.

3. **Heat Treatment and Finishing**: After shaping, the glass products may undergo heat treatment to relieve stresses and enhance properties, followed by finishing processes like polishing, cutting, and edge treatment to achieve the final product specifications and quality.","# Glassworking

12.4 Product Design Considerations  

Glass products are commercially manufactured in an  almost unlimited variety of shapes. Many are produced  in very large quantities, such as light bulbs, beverage  bottles, and window glass. Others, such as giant tele- scope lenses, are made individually.  

Glass is one of three basic types of ceramics (Chap- ter 7). It is distinguished by its noncrystalline (vitreous)  structure, whereas the other ceramic materials have  a crystalline structure. The methods by which glass is  shaped into useful products are quite different from  those used for the other types. In glassworking, the  principal starting material is silica  $(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ ; this is usually  combined with other oxide ceramics that form glasses.  The starting material is heated to transform it from a  hard solid into a viscous liquid; it is then shaped into  the desired geometry while in this highly plastic or ﬂ  uid  condition. When cooled and hard, the material remains  in the glassy state rather than crystallizing.  

The typical manufacturing sequence in glassworking  consists of the steps pictured in Figure 12.1. Shaping is  accomplished by various processes, including casting,  pressing-and-blowing (to produce bottles and other  containers), and rolling (to make plate glass). A ﬁ  nish- ing step is required for certain products.

# Raw Materials  Preparation and  Melting  

The main component in nearly all glasses is silica, the  primary source of which is natural quartz in sand. The  sand must be washed and classiﬁ  ed. Washing removes  impurities such as clay and certain minerals that would  cause undesirable coloring of the glass.  Classifying  the  sand means grouping the grains according to size. The  most desirable particle size for glassmaking is in the  range of 0.1 to $0.6\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.004–0.025 in) [3]. The various  other components, such as soda ash (source of  $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{l}$ ),  limestone (source of  $\mathrm{CaO}$ ), aluminum oxide, potash

(source of  $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ ), and other minerals are added in the proper proportions to achieve  the desired composition. The mixing is usually done in batches, in amounts that are  compatible with the capacities of available melting furnaces.  

Recycled glass is usually added to the mixture in modern practice. In addition  to preserving the environment, recycled glass facilitates melting. Depending on the  amount of waste glass available and the speciﬁ  cations of the ﬁ  nal composition, the  proportion of recycled glass may be up to $100\%$ .  

The batch of starting materials to be melted is referred to as a  charge , and the pro- cedure of loading it into the melting furnace is called  charging  the furnace. Glass- melting furnaces can be divided into the following types [3]: (1)  pot furnaces —  ceramic pots of limited capacity in which melting occurs by heating the walls of the  pot; (2)  day tanks —larger capacity vessels for batch production in which heating is  done by burning fuels above the charge; (3)  continuous tank furnaces —long tank  furnaces in which raw materials are fed in one end, and melted as they move to the  other end where molten glass is drawn out for high production; and (4)  electric fur- naces  of various designs for a wide range of production rates. A gob of molten glass is dropped into  a conical mold made of steel. The mold is rotated so that centrifugal force causes  the glass to ﬂ  ow upward and spread itself on the mold surface. The faceplate (i.e.,  the front viewing screen) is later assembled to the funnel using a sealing glass of low  melting point.  

Pressing  This is a widely used process for mass producing glass pieces such as dishes,  bake ware, headlight lenses, TV tube faceplates, and similar items that are relatively  ﬂ  at. The process is illustrated and described in Figure 12.3. The large quantities of most  pressed products justify a high level of automation in this production sequence.  

Blowing  Several shaping sequences include blowing as one or more of the steps.  Instead of a manual operation, blowing is performed on highly automated equip- ment. The two sequences described here are the press-and-blow and blow-and-blow  methods.  

As the name indicates, the  press-and-blow  method is a pressing operation fol- lowed by a blowing operation, as portrayed in Figure 12.4. The process is suited to

the production of wide-mouth containers. A split mold is used in the blowing opera- tion for part removal. The  blow-and-blow  method is used to produce smaller-mouthed bottles. The se- quence is similar to the preceding, except that two (or more) blowing operations are  used rather than pressing and blowing. There are variations to the process, depend- ing on the geometry of the product, with one possible sequence shown in Figure 12.5.

Reheating is sometimes required between blowing steps. Duplicate and triplicate  molds are sometimes used along with matching gob feeders to increase production  rates. Press-and-blow and blow-and-blow methods are used to make jars, beverage  bottles, incandescent light bulb enclosures, and similar geometries.  

Casting  If the molten glass is sufﬁ  ciently ﬂ  uid, it can be poured into a mold. Rela- tively massive objects, such as astronomical lenses and mirrors, are made by this  method. These pieces must be cooled very slowly to avoid internal stresses and pos- sible cracking owing to temperature gradients that would otherwise be set up in  the glass. After cooling and solidifying, the piece must be ﬁ  nished by lapping and  polishing. Casting is not much used in glassworking except for these kinds of special  jobs.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec12.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec12.txt","0.859134737727627, 0.8420921898948648"
Melting furnace for glassworking can be divided into four types. Name three of the four types.,"Answer. The four types are: (1) pot furnaces, (2) day tanks, (3) continuous tank furnaces, and (4) electric furnaces.","The three types of melting furnaces for glassworking are:

1. Pot furnaces: These use ceramic pots of limited capacity where melting occurs by heating the walls of the pot.

2. Day tanks: These are larger vessels for batch production where heating is done by burning fuels above the charge.

3. Continuous tank furnaces: These long tank furnaces feed raw materials in one end, melting them as they move to the other end where molten glass is drawn out for high production rates.","The batch of starting materials to be melted is referred to as a  charge , and the pro- cedure of loading it into the melting furnace is called  charging  the furnace. Glass- melting furnaces can be divided into the following types [3]: (1)  pot furnaces —  ceramic pots of limited capacity in which melting occurs by heating the walls of the  pot; (2)  day tanks —larger capacity vessels for batch production in which heating is  done by burning fuels above the charge; (3)  continuous tank furnaces —long tank  furnaces in which raw materials are fed in one end, and melted as they move to the  other end where molten glass is drawn out for high production; and (4)  electric fur- naces  of various designs for a wide range of production rates.  

Glass melting is generally carried out at temperatures around  $1500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to  $1600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ $(2700^{\circ}\mathrm{F}{-}2900^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ). The melting cycle for a typical charge takes 24 to 48 hours. This  is the time required for all of the sand grains to become a clear liquid and for the  molten glass to be reﬁ  ned and cooled to the appropriate temperature for working.  Molten glass is a viscous liquid, the viscosity being inversely related to temperature.  Because the shaping operation immediately follows the melting cycle, the tempera- ture at which the glass is tapped from the furnace depends on the viscosity required  for the subsequent process.  

#  Shaping Processes in Glassworking  

The major categories of glass products were identiﬁ  ed in Section 7.4.2 as window  glass, containers, light bulbs, laboratory glassware, glass ﬁ  bers, and optical glass. De- spite the variety represented by this list, the shaping processes to fabricate these  products can be grouped into only three categories: (1) discrete processes for piece  ware, which includes bottles, light bulbs, and other individual items; (2) continuous  processes for making ﬂ  at glass (sheet and plate glass for windows) and tubing (for  laboratory ware and ﬂ  uorescent lights); and (3) ﬁ  ber-making processes to produce  ﬁ  bers for insulation, ﬁ  berglass composite materials, and ﬁ  ber optics.

Spinning  Glass spinning is similar to  centrifugal casting  of metals, and is also  known by that name in glassworking. It is used to produce funnel-shaped compo- nents such as the back sections of cathode ray tubes for televisions and computer  monitors. The setup is pictured in Figure 12.2.

12.4 Product Design Considerations  

Glass products are commercially manufactured in an  almost unlimited variety of shapes. Many are produced  in very large quantities, such as light bulbs, beverage  bottles, and window glass. Others, such as giant tele- scope lenses, are made individually.  

Glass is one of three basic types of ceramics (Chap- ter 7). It is distinguished by its noncrystalline (vitreous)  structure, whereas the other ceramic materials have  a crystalline structure. The methods by which glass is  shaped into useful products are quite different from  those used for the other types. In glassworking, the  principal starting material is silica  $(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ ; this is usually  combined with other oxide ceramics that form glasses.  The starting material is heated to transform it from a  hard solid into a viscous liquid; it is then shaped into  the desired geometry while in this highly plastic or ﬂ  uid  condition. When cooled and hard, the material remains  in the glassy state rather than crystallizing.  

The typical manufacturing sequence in glassworking  consists of the steps pictured in Figure 12.1. Shaping is  accomplished by various processes, including casting,  pressing-and-blowing (to produce bottles and other  containers), and rolling (to make plate glass). A ﬁ  nish- ing step is required for certain products.

# Raw Materials  Preparation and  Melting  

The main component in nearly all glasses is silica, the  primary source of which is natural quartz in sand. The  sand must be washed and classiﬁ  ed. Washing removes  impurities such as clay and certain minerals that would  cause undesirable coloring of the glass.  Classifying  the  sand means grouping the grains according to size. The  most desirable particle size for glassmaking is in the  range of 0.1 to $0.6\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.004–0.025 in) [3]. The various  other components, such as soda ash (source of  $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{l}$ ),  limestone (source of  $\mathrm{CaO}$ ), aluminum oxide, potash

(source of  $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ ), and other minerals are added in the proper proportions to achieve  the desired composition. The mixing is usually done in batches, in amounts that are  compatible with the capacities of available melting furnaces.  

Recycled glass is usually added to the mixture in modern practice. In addition  to preserving the environment, recycled glass facilitates melting. Depending on the  amount of waste glass available and the speciﬁ  cations of the ﬁ  nal composition, the  proportion of recycled glass may be up to $100\%$ .  

The batch of starting materials to be melted is referred to as a  charge , and the pro- cedure of loading it into the melting furnace is called  charging  the furnace. Glass- melting furnaces can be divided into the following types [3]: (1)  pot furnaces —  ceramic pots of limited capacity in which melting occurs by heating the walls of the  pot; (2)  day tanks —larger capacity vessels for batch production in which heating is  done by burning fuels above the charge; (3)  continuous tank furnaces —long tank  furnaces in which raw materials are fed in one end, and melted as they move to the  other end where molten glass is drawn out for high production; and (4)  electric fur- naces  of various designs for a wide range of production rates.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec12.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec12.txt","0.8671932403226366, 0.8456126307883323"
Describe the spinning process in glassworking.,"Answer. Spinning in glassworking is similar to centrifugal casting in metalworking. A gob of molten glass is dropped in to a conical mold which spins, causing centrifugal force to spread the glass upward onto the mold surface.","The spinning process in glassworking involves using centrifugal force to shape molten glass into funnel-shaped components. Here's how the process works:

1. **Molten Glass Introduction**: A gob of molten glass is dropped into a conical mold made of steel. This gob is precisely measured to ensure the correct final dimensions of the glass piece.

2. **Mold Rotation**: The mold is rotated rapidly. As it spins, centrifugal force pushes the molten glass upward and outward, causing it to spread evenly along the inner surface of the mold.

3. **Glass Shaping**: The glass is shaped as it is forced against the mold’s walls by the centrifugal force. This ensures uniform thickness and shape, crucial for components such as the back sections of cathode ray tubes used in televisions and computer monitors.

4. **Cooling and Solidifying**: Once the desired shape is achieved, the glass cools and solidifies, maintaining the shape it formed in the mold. 

This spinning process allows for the efficient production of complex shapes with consistent wall thicknesses, employing the principles similar to those used in centrifugal metal casting. The technique is highly effective for producing parts with rotational symmetry and is well-suited for high-volume production with a high level of automation.","The rolled glass sheet must later be ground and polished  for parallelism and smoothness.

FIGURE 12.7  The ﬂ  oat  process for producing  sheet glass.  

Float Process  This process was developed in the late 1950s. Its advantage over  other methods such as rolling is that it obtains smooth surfaces that need no sub- sequent ﬁ  nishing. In the  ﬂ  oat process , illustrated in Figure 12.7, the glass ﬂ  ows di- rectly from its melting furnace onto the surface of a molten tin bath. The highly ﬂ  uid  glass spreads evenly across the molten tin surface, achieving a uniform thickness and  smoothness. After moving into a cooler region of the bath, the glass hardens and  travels through an annealing furnace, after which it is cut to size.  

Drawing of Glass Tubes  Glass tubing is manufactured by a drawing process  known as the  Danner process , illustrated in Figure 12.8. Molten glass ﬂ  ows around a  rotating hollow mandrel through which air is blown while the glass is being drawn.  The air temperature and its volumetric ﬂ  ow rate, as well as the drawing velocity,

determine the diameter and wall thickness of the tubular cross section. During hard- ening, the glass tube is supported by a series of rollers extending about  $30\:\mathrm{m}$  (100 ft)  beyond the mandrel. The continuous tubing is then cut into standard lengths.  Tubular glass products include laboratory glassware, ﬂ  uorescent light tubes, and  thermometers.  

# 12.2.3  FORMING OF GLASS FIBERS  

Glass ﬁ  bers are used in applications ranging from insulation wool to ﬁ  ber optics  communications lines (Section 7.4.2). Glass ﬁ  ber products can be divided into two  categories [6]: (1) ﬁ  brous glass for thermal insulation, acoustical insulation, and air  ﬁ  ltration, in which the ﬁ  bers are in a random, wool-like condition; and (2) long, con- tinuous ﬁ  laments suitable for ﬁ  ber-reinforced plastics, yarns and fabrics, and ﬁ  ber  optics. Different production methods are used for the two categories. Two methods  are described in the following paragraphs, representing each of the product catego- ries, respectively.  

Centrifugal Spraying  In a typical process for making glass wool, molten glass  ﬂ  ows into a rotating bowl with many small oriﬁ  ces around its periphery. Centrifugal  force causes the glass to ﬂ  ow through the holes to become a ﬁ  brous mass suitable for  thermal and acoustical insulation.  

Drawing of Continuous Filaments  In this process, illustrated in Figure 12.9,  continuous glass ﬁ  bers of small diameter (lower size limit is around  $0.0025~\mathrm{mm}$  or  0.0001 in) are produced by drawing strands of molten glass through small oriﬁ  ces in  

![](images/e1e4c821dae73b6f342df55b4ed2db4a27612da7df8041b383997d82deaa4389.jpg)  

a heated plate made of a platinum alloy. The plate may have several hundred holes,  each making one ﬁ  ber. The individual ﬁ  bers are collected into a strand by reeling  them onto a spool. The batch of starting materials to be melted is referred to as a  charge , and the pro- cedure of loading it into the melting furnace is called  charging  the furnace. Glass- melting furnaces can be divided into the following types [3]: (1)  pot furnaces —  ceramic pots of limited capacity in which melting occurs by heating the walls of the  pot; (2)  day tanks —larger capacity vessels for batch production in which heating is  done by burning fuels above the charge; (3)  continuous tank furnaces —long tank  furnaces in which raw materials are fed in one end, and melted as they move to the  other end where molten glass is drawn out for high production; and (4)  electric fur- naces  of various designs for a wide range of production rates.  

Glass melting is generally carried out at temperatures around  $1500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to  $1600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ $(2700^{\circ}\mathrm{F}{-}2900^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ). The melting cycle for a typical charge takes 24 to 48 hours. This  is the time required for all of the sand grains to become a clear liquid and for the  molten glass to be reﬁ  ned and cooled to the appropriate temperature for working.  Molten glass is a viscous liquid, the viscosity being inversely related to temperature.  Because the shaping operation immediately follows the melting cycle, the tempera- ture at which the glass is tapped from the furnace depends on the viscosity required  for the subsequent process.  

#  Shaping Processes in Glassworking  

The major categories of glass products were identiﬁ  ed in Section 7.4.2 as window  glass, containers, light bulbs, laboratory glassware, glass ﬁ  bers, and optical glass. De- spite the variety represented by this list, the shaping processes to fabricate these  products can be grouped into only three categories: (1) discrete processes for piece  ware, which includes bottles, light bulbs, and other individual items; (2) continuous  processes for making ﬂ  at glass (sheet and plate glass for windows) and tubing (for  laboratory ware and ﬂ  uorescent lights); and (3) ﬁ  ber-making processes to produce  ﬁ  bers for insulation, ﬁ  berglass composite materials, and ﬁ  ber optics.

What is the main difference between the press-and-blow and the blow-and-blow shaping processes in glassworking?,"Answer. In the press-and-blow process, the initial forming step is pressing of the part, while the first step in the blow-and-blow process is blowing.","The main difference between the press-and-blow and blow-and-blow shaping processes in glassworking lies in how the initial shape is formed before the final blowing step.

1. **Press-and-Blow Method**:
   - **Initial Forming**: A gob of molten glass is first pressed into a parison using a plunger in a press mold. This creates a preliminary shape with a defined neck and body.
   - **Final Shaping**: The partially formed parison is then transferred to a blow mold where air is blown into it to expand it into the final shape.

2. **Blow-and-Blow Method**:
   - **Initial Forming**: A gob of glass is fed into an inverted mold, and then air is blown into it to create the initial shape or parison.
   - **Reheating and Final Shaping**: The parison is often reoriented and transferred to a second blow mold, where it undergoes another blowing operation to achieve the final shape.

The press-and-blow method is generally used for wide-mouth containers, as the pressing operation allows for better control over the thickness and shape of the container’s mouth. In contrast, the blow-and-blow method is better suited for smaller-mouthed bottles.","A gob of molten glass is dropped into  a conical mold made of steel.

The se- quence is similar to the preceding, except that two (or more) blowing operations are  used rather than pressing and blowing. There are variations to the process, depend- ing on the geometry of the product, with one possible sequence shown in Figure 12.5.

Reheating is sometimes required between blowing steps. Duplicate and triplicate  molds are sometimes used along with matching gob feeders to increase production  rates. Press-and-blow and blow-and-blow methods are used to make jars, beverage  bottles, incandescent light bulb enclosures, and similar geometries.  

Casting  If the molten glass is sufﬁ  ciently ﬂ  uid, it can be poured into a mold. Rela- tively massive objects, such as astronomical lenses and mirrors, are made by this  method. These pieces must be cooled very slowly to avoid internal stresses and pos- sible cracking owing to temperature gradients that would otherwise be set up in  the glass. After cooling and solidifying, the piece must be ﬁ  nished by lapping and  polishing. Casting is not much used in glassworking except for these kinds of special  jobs.

# 12.2.2  SHAPING OF FLAT AND TUBULAR GLASS  

Two methods for making plate glass and one method for producing tube stock are  described here. They are continuous processes, in which long sections of ﬂ  at window  glass or glass tubing are made and later cut into appropriate sizes and lengths. They  are modern technologies in contrast to the ancient method described in Historical  Note 12.1.  

# Historical Note 12.1  Ancient methods of making ﬂ  at glass  [7]  

Glass windows have been used in buildings for many  centuries. The oldest process for making ﬂ  at window  glass was by manual glass blowing. The procedure  consisted of the following: (1) a glass globe was blown  on a blowpipe; (2) a portion of the globe was made  to stick to the end of a “punty, ” a metal rod used by  glassblowers, and then detached from the blowpipe;  and (3) after reheating the glass, the punty was rotated  with sufﬁ  cient speed for centrifugal force to shape the  open globe into a ﬂ  at disk. The disk, whose maximum  possible size was only about  $1\,\mathrm{~m~}$  (3 ft), was later cut  into small panes for windows.  

At the center of the disk, where the glass was  attached to the punty during the third step in the  process, a lump would tend to form that had the ap- pearance of a crown. The name “crown glass” was  derived from this resemblance. Lenses for spectacles  were ground from glass made by this method. Today,  the name crown glass is still used for certain types  of optical and ophthalmic glass, even though the an- cient method has been replaced by modern produc- tion technology.  

Rolling of Flat Plate  Flat plate glass can be produced by rolling, as illustrated in  Figure 12.6. The starting glass, in a suitably plastic condition from the furnace, is  squeezed through opposing rolls whose separation determines the thickness of the  sheet. The rolling operation is usually set up so that the ﬂ  at glass is moved directly  into an annealing furnace. The rolled glass sheet must later be ground and polished  for parallelism and smoothness.

There are several ways of shaping plate or sheet glass. Name and briefly describe one of them.,"Answer. The methods described in this test are: (1) rolling, in which the hot glass is squeezed between opposing cylindrical rolls; and (2) the float process, in which the melted glass flows onto a molten tin surface to achieve uniform thickness and smoothness.","One method for shaping plate or sheet glass is the Float Process. Developed in the late 1950s, this process involves floating molten glass on a bed of molten tin. The glass spreads out over the liquid tin, forming a uniform thickness due to surface tension and gravity. It then moves through a controlled atmosphere where it is slowly cooled. This method yields glass with smooth surfaces that require no additional finishing, making it highly efficient for producing high-quality flat glass for windows and mirrors. The float process is now the standard method used in the majority of flat glass production.","Reheating is sometimes required between blowing steps.

The se- quence is similar to the preceding, except that two (or more) blowing operations are  used rather than pressing and blowing. There are variations to the process, depend- ing on the geometry of the product, with one possible sequence shown in Figure 12.5.

Reheating is sometimes required between blowing steps. Duplicate and triplicate  molds are sometimes used along with matching gob feeders to increase production  rates. Press-and-blow and blow-and-blow methods are used to make jars, beverage  bottles, incandescent light bulb enclosures, and similar geometries.  

Casting  If the molten glass is sufﬁ  ciently ﬂ  uid, it can be poured into a mold. Rela- tively massive objects, such as astronomical lenses and mirrors, are made by this  method. These pieces must be cooled very slowly to avoid internal stresses and pos- sible cracking owing to temperature gradients that would otherwise be set up in  the glass. After cooling and solidifying, the piece must be ﬁ  nished by lapping and  polishing. Casting is not much used in glassworking except for these kinds of special  jobs.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec12.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec12.txt","0.8684644725179882, 0.8593652758152053"
Describe the Danner process?,"Answer. In the Danner process, molten glass flows around a rotating hollow mandrel through which air is blown while the glass is being drawn. The temperature of the air and its volumetric flow rate as well as the drawing velocity determine the diameter and wall thickness of the tubular cross-section. During hardening, the glass tube is supported by a series of rollers extending beyond the mandrel.","The Danner process is a method used in the glass manufacturing industry, specifically for producing glass tubing. In this process, molten glass flows continuously from a tank furnace. The glass is shaped into a hollow cylinder over a rotating mandrel. As the mandrel rotates, a controlled flow of air is introduced into the hot glass to maintain its tubular shape. The glass tube is then drawn out and gradually cooled in a lehr to temper the material, giving it the desired strength and durability.

The advantages of the Danner process include its ability to produce long, continuous lengths of glass tubing with uniform dimensions, which is highly efficient for large-scale production. The process is versatile, allowing for the creation of tubes with various diameters and wall thicknesses. This method is widely used for manufacturing products such as fluorescent light tubes, laboratory glassware, and other technical glass applications.","The advantage of the Guerin process is the relatively low cost of the tooling.  The form block can be made of wood, plastic, or other materials that are easy to  shape, and the rubber pad can be used with different form blocks. These factors

make rubber forming attractive in small-quantity production, such as the aircraft  industry, where the process was developed.  

Hydroforming  Hydroforming is similar to the Guerin process; the difference  is that it substitutes a rubber diaphragm ﬁ  lled with hydraulic ﬂ  uid in place of the  thick rubber pad, as illustrated in Figure 19.29. This allows the pressure that forms  the work part to be increased—to around  $100\;\mathrm{MPa}$  ( $\cdot15{,}000\ \mathrm{lb/in}^{2}\$ ) —thus prevent- ing wrinkling in deep formed parts. In fact, deeper draws can be achieved with the  hydroform process than with conventional deep drawing. This is because the uni- form pressure in hydroforming forces the work to contact the punch throughout its  length, thus increasing friction and reducing the tensile stresses that cause tearing at  the base of the drawn cup.  

#  Dies and Presses for Sheet-Metal Processes  

This section examines the punch-and-die tooling and production equipment used in  conventional sheet-metal processing.  

# 19.5.1  DIES  

Nearly all of the preceding pressworking operations are performed with conventional  punch-and-die tooling. The tooling is referred to as a  die . It is custom-  designed for  the particular part to be produced. The term  stamping die  is sometimes used for high- production dies. Typical materials for stamping dies are tool steel types D, A, O, and  S (Table 6.5).  

Components of a Stamping Die  The components of a stamping die to perform  a simple blanking operation are illustrated in Figure 19.30. The working components  are the  punch  and  die , which perform the cutting operation. They are attached to  

![](images/ad5b406287c0422b07a6d716257e3ef4107701464a4c80568af0eb44e00268ea.jpg)  
FIGURE 19.30  Components of a punch  and die for a blanking  operation.  

the upper and lower portions of the  die set , respectively called the  punch holder  (or  upper shoe ) and  die holder  ( lower shoe ). The die set also includes guide pins and  bushings to ensure proper alignment between the punch and die during the stamping  operation. The die holder is attached to the base of the press, and the punch holder is  attached to the ram. Actuation of the ram accomplishes the pressworking operation.  

In addition to these components, a die used for blanking or hole-punching must  include a means of preventing the sheet metal from sticking to the punch when it is  retracted upward after the operation. The newly created hole in the stock is the same  size as the punch, and it tends to cling to the punch on its withdrawal. The device  in the die that strips the sheet metal from the punch is called a  stripper . It is often  a simple plate attached to the die as in Figure 19.30, with a hole slightly larger than  the punch diameter.  

For dies that process strips or coils of sheet metal, a device is required to stop the  sheet metal as it advances through the die between press cycles. ![](images/5aa7ac66afbfc2792b72b072765bfb8fd1b4f83eea01f6cd05dccc580d60c825.jpg)  
FIGURE 14.16  Coating  of fabric with rubber  using a calendering  process.  

Alternatives to calendering include skimming, dipping, and spraying. In the  skimming  process, a thick solution of rubber compound in an organic solvent is  applied to the fabric as it is unreeled from a supply spool. The coated fabric passes  under a doctor blade that skims the solvent to the proper thickness, and then moves  into a steam chamber where the solvent is driven off by heat. As its name suggests,  dipping  involves temporary immersion of the fabric into a highly ﬂ  uid solution of  rubber, followed by drying. In  spraying , a spray gun is used to apply the rubber  solution.  

Molding and Casting  Molded articles include shoe soles and heels, gaskets and  seals, suction cups, and bottle stops. Many foamed rubber parts are produced by  molding. In addition, molding is an important process in tire production. Principal  molding processes for rubber are (1) compression molding, (2) transfer molding,  and (3) injection molding. Compression molding is the most important technique  because of its use in tire manufacture. Curing (vulcanizing) is accomplished in the  mold in all three processes, this representing a departure from the shaping methods  already discussed, which require a separate vulcanizing step. With injection mold- ing of rubber, there are risks of premature curing similar to those faced in the same  process when applied to thermosetting plastics. Advantages of injection molding  over traditional methods for producing rubber parts include better dimensional  control, less scrap, and shorter cycle times. In addition to its use in the molding of  conventional rubbers, injection molding is also applied for thermoplastic elastom- ers. Because of high mold costs, large production quantities are required to justify  injection molding.  

A form of casting, called  dip casting , is used for producing rubber gloves and  overshoes. It involves submersion of a positive mold in a liquid polymer (or a heated  form into plastisol) for a certain duration (the process may involve repeated dip- pings) to form the desired thickness. The coating is then stripped from the form and  cured to cross-link the rubber.  

# 14.5.4  VULCANIZATION  

Vulcanization is the treatment that accomplishes cross-linking of elastomer mol- ecules, so that the rubber becomes stiffer and stronger but retains extensibility. It  is a critical step in the rubber processing sequence. On a submicroscopic scale, the  process can be pictured as in Figure 14.17, in which the long-chain molecules of  

![](images/6be5e72653c45e94acf0058dcfb12a9d2d63bb9d8583d61e584030ca73c863d9.jpg)  
FIGURE 14.17  Effect  of vulcanization on the  rubber   molecules: (1) raw  rubber; (2)   vulcanized  (cross-linked) rubber.  Variations of (2) include  (a) soft rubber, low  degree of cross-linking;  and (b) hard rubber, high  degree of cross-linking.  

the rubber become joined at certain tie points, the effect of which is to reduce the  ability of the elastomer to ﬂ  ow. A typical soft rubber has one or two cross-links per  thousand units (mers). As the number of cross-links increases, the polymer becomes  stiffer and behaves more like a thermosetting plastic (hard rubber).  

Vulcanization, as it was ﬁ  rst invented by Charles Goodyear in 1839, involved the  use of sulfur (about 8 parts by weight of S mixed with 100 parts of natural rubber) at  a temperature of $140^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\left(280^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\right)$  for about 5 hours. No other chemicals were included  in the process. Vulcanization with sulfur alone is no longer used as a commercial  treatment today, because of the long curing times.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec19.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec14.txt","0.7897490329507804, 0.7881567765870501"
Two processes for forming glass fibers are discussed in the text. Name and briefly describe one of them.,"Answer. The two processes in the text are: (1) drawing, in which fine glass fibers are pulled through small orifices in a heated plate; and (2) centrifugal spraying, in which molten glass is forced to flow through small orifices in a rapidly rotating bowl to form glass fibers.","One of the processes for forming glass fibers is ""Drawing of Continuous Filaments."" In this process, molten glass is drawn through small orifices in a heated plate made of platinum alloy. The fibers produced are of small diameter and are continuous. These fibers are gathered into strands and wound onto a spool. This method is commonly used for producing long, continuous glass filaments suitable for reinforcing plastics, making yarns and fabrics, and manufacturing fiber optics.","# Glassworking

12.4 Product Design Considerations  

Glass products are commercially manufactured in an  almost unlimited variety of shapes. Many are produced  in very large quantities, such as light bulbs, beverage  bottles, and window glass. Others, such as giant tele- scope lenses, are made individually.  

Glass is one of three basic types of ceramics (Chap- ter 7). It is distinguished by its noncrystalline (vitreous)  structure, whereas the other ceramic materials have  a crystalline structure. The methods by which glass is  shaped into useful products are quite different from  those used for the other types. In glassworking, the  principal starting material is silica  $(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ ; this is usually  combined with other oxide ceramics that form glasses.  The starting material is heated to transform it from a  hard solid into a viscous liquid; it is then shaped into  the desired geometry while in this highly plastic or ﬂ  uid  condition. When cooled and hard, the material remains  in the glassy state rather than crystallizing.  

The typical manufacturing sequence in glassworking  consists of the steps pictured in Figure 12.1. Shaping is  accomplished by various processes, including casting,  pressing-and-blowing (to produce bottles and other  containers), and rolling (to make plate glass). A ﬁ  nish- ing step is required for certain products.

# Raw Materials  Preparation and  Melting  

The main component in nearly all glasses is silica, the  primary source of which is natural quartz in sand. The  sand must be washed and classiﬁ  ed. Washing removes  impurities such as clay and certain minerals that would  cause undesirable coloring of the glass.  Classifying  the  sand means grouping the grains according to size. The  most desirable particle size for glassmaking is in the  range of 0.1 to $0.6\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.004–0.025 in) [3]. The various  other components, such as soda ash (source of  $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{l}$ ),  limestone (source of  $\mathrm{CaO}$ ), aluminum oxide, potash

(source of  $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ ), and other minerals are added in the proper proportions to achieve  the desired composition. The mixing is usually done in batches, in amounts that are  compatible with the capacities of available melting furnaces.  

Recycled glass is usually added to the mixture in modern practice. In addition  to preserving the environment, recycled glass facilitates melting. Depending on the  amount of waste glass available and the speciﬁ  cations of the ﬁ  nal composition, the  proportion of recycled glass may be up to $100\%$ .  

The batch of starting materials to be melted is referred to as a  charge , and the pro- cedure of loading it into the melting furnace is called  charging  the furnace. Glass- melting furnaces can be divided into the following types [3]: (1)  pot furnaces —  ceramic pots of limited capacity in which melting occurs by heating the walls of the  pot; (2)  day tanks —larger capacity vessels for batch production in which heating is  done by burning fuels above the charge; (3)  continuous tank furnaces —long tank  furnaces in which raw materials are fed in one end, and melted as they move to the  other end where molten glass is drawn out for high production; and (4)  electric fur- naces  of various designs for a wide range of production rates. The rolled glass sheet must later be ground and polished  for parallelism and smoothness.

FIGURE 12.7  The ﬂ  oat  process for producing  sheet glass.  

Float Process  This process was developed in the late 1950s. Its advantage over  other methods such as rolling is that it obtains smooth surfaces that need no sub- sequent ﬁ  nishing. In the  ﬂ  oat process , illustrated in Figure 12.7, the glass ﬂ  ows di- rectly from its melting furnace onto the surface of a molten tin bath. The highly ﬂ  uid  glass spreads evenly across the molten tin surface, achieving a uniform thickness and  smoothness. After moving into a cooler region of the bath, the glass hardens and  travels through an annealing furnace, after which it is cut to size.  

Drawing of Glass Tubes  Glass tubing is manufactured by a drawing process  known as the  Danner process , illustrated in Figure 12.8. Molten glass ﬂ  ows around a  rotating hollow mandrel through which air is blown while the glass is being drawn.  The air temperature and its volumetric ﬂ  ow rate, as well as the drawing velocity,

determine the diameter and wall thickness of the tubular cross section. During hard- ening, the glass tube is supported by a series of rollers extending about  $30\:\mathrm{m}$  (100 ft)  beyond the mandrel. The continuous tubing is then cut into standard lengths.  Tubular glass products include laboratory glassware, ﬂ  uorescent light tubes, and  thermometers.  

# 12.2.3  FORMING OF GLASS FIBERS  

Glass ﬁ  bers are used in applications ranging from insulation wool to ﬁ  ber optics  communications lines (Section 7.4.2). Glass ﬁ  ber products can be divided into two  categories [6]: (1) ﬁ  brous glass for thermal insulation, acoustical insulation, and air  ﬁ  ltration, in which the ﬁ  bers are in a random, wool-like condition; and (2) long, con- tinuous ﬁ  laments suitable for ﬁ  ber-reinforced plastics, yarns and fabrics, and ﬁ  ber  optics. Different production methods are used for the two categories. Two methods  are described in the following paragraphs, representing each of the product catego- ries, respectively.  

Centrifugal Spraying  In a typical process for making glass wool, molten glass  ﬂ  ows into a rotating bowl with many small oriﬁ  ces around its periphery. Centrifugal  force causes the glass to ﬂ  ow through the holes to become a ﬁ  brous mass suitable for  thermal and acoustical insulation.  

Drawing of Continuous Filaments  In this process, illustrated in Figure 12.9,  continuous glass ﬁ  bers of small diameter (lower size limit is around  $0.0025~\mathrm{mm}$  or  0.0001 in) are produced by drawing strands of molten glass through small oriﬁ  ces in

What is the purpose of annealing in glassworking?,Answer. Annealing is performed on glass to remove internal stresses that result from shaping and solidification.,"The purpose of annealing in glassworking is to relieve undesirable internal stresses developed during the forming process. These stresses, if left unaddressed, can significantly reduce the strength of the glass product, making it more prone to cracking or breaking. The annealing process involves heating the glass to an elevated temperature, maintaining it at that temperature for a certain period to allow for stress relief, and then slowly cooling the glass to suppress the reformation of stresses. Finally, rapid cooling to room temperature is performed. This careful thermal cycle ensures the structural integrity and longevity of the glass. The annealing temperature is typically around \(500^{\circ}\mathrm{C} (900^{\circ}\mathrm{F})\), and the time required varies with the square of the glass thickness. In modern glass production, annealing is often done in lehrs, which are tunnel-like furnaces that provide the necessary controlled heat treatment cycle.","Drawing of Continuous Filaments  In this process, illustrated in Figure 12.9,  continuous glass ﬁ  bers of small diameter (lower size limit is around  $0.0025~\mathrm{mm}$  or  0.0001 in) are produced by drawing strands of molten glass through small oriﬁ  ces in

a heated plate made of a platinum alloy. The plate may have several hundred holes,  each making one ﬁ  ber. The individual ﬁ  bers are collected into a strand by reeling  them onto a spool. Before spooling, the ﬁ  bers are coated with various chemicals  to lubricate and protect them. Drawing speeds of around  $50\;\mathrm{m/s}$   $(10{,}000\;\mathrm{ft/min})$ ) or  more are not unusual.  

#  Heat Treatment and Finishing  

Heat treatment of the glass product is the third step in the glassworking sequence.  For some products, additional ﬁ  nishing operations are performed.  

# 12.3.1  HEAT TREATMENT  

Glass-ceramics were discussed in Section 7.4.3. This unique material is made by a  special heat treatment that transforms most of the vitreous state into a polycrys- talline ceramic. Other heat treatments performed on glass cause changes that are  less dramatic technologically but perhaps more important commercially; examples  include annealing and tempering.  

Annealing  Glass products usually have undesirable internal stresses after form- ing, which reduce their strength. Annealing is done to relieve these stresses; the  treatment therefore has the same function in glassworking as it does in metalwork- ing.  Annealing  involves heating the glass to an elevated temperature and holding  it for a certain period to eliminate stresses and temperature gradients, then slowly  cooling the glass to suppress stress formation, followed by more rapid cooling to  room temperature. Common annealing temperatures are around $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\left(900^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\right)$ . The  length of time the product is held at the temperature, as well as the heating and cool- ing rates during the cycle, depend on thickness of the glass, the usual rule being that  the required annealing time varies with the square of thickness.  

Annealing in modern glass factories is performed in tunnel-like furnaces, called  lehrs , in which the products ﬂ  ow slowly through the hot chamber on conveyors.  Burners are located only at the front end of the chamber, so that the glass experi- ences the required heating and cooling cycle.  

Tempered Glass and Related Products  A beneﬁ  cial internal stress pattern can be  developed in glass products by a heat treatment known as  tempering , and the result- ing material is called  tempered glass . As in the treatment of hardened steel, tempering  increases the toughness of glass. The process involves heating the glass to a tempera- ture somewhat above its annealing temperature and into the plastic range, followed by  quenching of the surfaces, usually with air jets. When the surfaces cool, they contract  and harden while the interior is still plastic and compliant. As the internal glass slowly  cools, it contracts, thus putting the hard surfaces in compression. Like other ceramics,  glass is much stronger when subjected to compressive stresses than tensile stresses. Ac- cordingly, tempered glass is much more resistant to scratching and breaking because  of the compressive stresses on its surfaces. Applications include windows for tall build- ings, all-glass doors, safety glasses, and other products requiring toughened glass.  

When tempered glass fails, it does so by shattering into numerous small frag- ments that are less likely to cut someone than conventional (annealed) window  glass.   Interestingly, automobile windshields are not made of tempered glass, because  

of the danger posed to the driver by this fragmentation. Instead, conventional glass  is used; however, it is fabricated by sandwiching two pieces of glass on either side of  a tough polymer sheet. Should this  laminated glass  fracture, the glass splinters are  retained by the polymer sheet and the windshield remains relatively transparent.  

# 12.3.2  FINISHING  

Finishing operations are sometimes required for glassware products. These sec- ondary operations include grinding, polishing, and cutting. Reheating is sometimes required between blowing steps. Duplicate and triplicate  molds are sometimes used along with matching gob feeders to increase production  rates. Press-and-blow and blow-and-blow methods are used to make jars, beverage  bottles, incandescent light bulb enclosures, and similar geometries.  

Casting  If the molten glass is sufﬁ  ciently ﬂ  uid, it can be poured into a mold. Rela- tively massive objects, such as astronomical lenses and mirrors, are made by this  method. These pieces must be cooled very slowly to avoid internal stresses and pos- sible cracking owing to temperature gradients that would otherwise be set up in  the glass. After cooling and solidifying, the piece must be ﬁ  nished by lapping and  polishing. Casting is not much used in glassworking except for these kinds of special  jobs. Not only is cooling and cracking a problem, but also molten glass is relatively  viscous at normal working temperatures, and does not ﬂ  ow through small oriﬁ  ces or  into small sections as well as molten metals or heated thermoplastics. Smaller lenses  are usually made by pressing, discussed above.  

# 12.2.2  SHAPING OF FLAT AND TUBULAR GLASS  

Two methods for making plate glass and one method for producing tube stock are  described here. They are continuous processes, in which long sections of ﬂ  at window  glass or glass tubing are made and later cut into appropriate sizes and lengths. They  are modern technologies in contrast to the ancient method described in Historical  Note 12.1.  

# Historical Note 12.1  Ancient methods of making ﬂ  at glass  [7]  

Glass windows have been used in buildings for many  centuries. The oldest process for making ﬂ  at window  glass was by manual glass blowing. The procedure  consisted of the following: (1) a glass globe was blown  on a blowpipe; (2) a portion of the globe was made  to stick to the end of a “punty, ” a metal rod used by  glassblowers, and then detached from the blowpipe;  and (3) after reheating the glass, the punty was rotated  with sufﬁ  cient speed for centrifugal force to shape the  open globe into a ﬂ  at disk. The disk, whose maximum  possible size was only about  $1\,\mathrm{~m~}$  (3 ft), was later cut  into small panes for windows.  

At the center of the disk, where the glass was  attached to the punty during the third step in the  process, a lump would tend to form that had the ap- pearance of a crown. The name “crown glass” was  derived from this resemblance. Lenses for spectacles  were ground from glass made by this method. Today,  the name crown glass is still used for certain types  of optical and ophthalmic glass, even though the an- cient method has been replaced by modern produc- tion technology.  

Rolling of Flat Plate  Flat plate glass can be produced by rolling, as illustrated in  Figure 12.6. The starting glass, in a suitably plastic condition from the furnace, is  squeezed through opposing rolls whose separation determines the thickness of the  sheet. The rolling operation is usually set up so that the ﬂ  at glass is moved directly  into an annealing furnace. The rolled glass sheet must later be ground and polished  for parallelism and smoothness.

Describe how a piece of glass is heat treated to produce tempered glass.,"Answer. The glass is heated to a temperature above the annealing temperature and the surfaces are then quenched by air jets to cool and harden them while the interior of the piece remains plastic; as the interior cools and contracts, it puts the previously hardened surfaces in compression, which strengthens it.","To produce tempered glass, the glass undergoes a specific heat treatment process that involves the following steps:

1. **Heating**: The glass is heated to a temperature above its annealing point, generally above 500°C (900°F), and into its plastic range. This process allows the glass to become pliable and ready for further processing.

2. **Quenching**: The heated glass is then rapidly cooled, specifically on its surfaces. This is typically achieved using air jets that blow cool air onto the glass surfaces, ensuring a quick temperature drop.

3. **Surface Compression**: As the surfaces cool and harden quickly while the interior remains more pliable, a compressive stress pattern develops on the surface layers of the glass.

4. **Cooling of Interior**: The interior of the glass cools more slowly, which causes it to contract, thereby pulling the surface into compression. This compressive stress on the surface enhances the glass's toughness and resistance to tension, making it much stronger against impacts and scratches.

Tempered glass is notably stronger than regular glass because of these compressive stresses and when broken, it shatters into small, less harmful pieces, making it ideal for applications like building windows and glass doors.","Drawing of Continuous Filaments  In this process, illustrated in Figure 12.9,  continuous glass ﬁ  bers of small diameter (lower size limit is around  $0.0025~\mathrm{mm}$  or  0.0001 in) are produced by drawing strands of molten glass through small oriﬁ  ces in

a heated plate made of a platinum alloy. The plate may have several hundred holes,  each making one ﬁ  ber. The individual ﬁ  bers are collected into a strand by reeling  them onto a spool. Before spooling, the ﬁ  bers are coated with various chemicals  to lubricate and protect them. Drawing speeds of around  $50\;\mathrm{m/s}$   $(10{,}000\;\mathrm{ft/min})$ ) or  more are not unusual.  

#  Heat Treatment and Finishing  

Heat treatment of the glass product is the third step in the glassworking sequence.  For some products, additional ﬁ  nishing operations are performed.  

# 12.3.1  HEAT TREATMENT  

Glass-ceramics were discussed in Section 7.4.3. This unique material is made by a  special heat treatment that transforms most of the vitreous state into a polycrys- talline ceramic. Other heat treatments performed on glass cause changes that are  less dramatic technologically but perhaps more important commercially; examples  include annealing and tempering.  

Annealing  Glass products usually have undesirable internal stresses after form- ing, which reduce their strength. Annealing is done to relieve these stresses; the  treatment therefore has the same function in glassworking as it does in metalwork- ing.  Annealing  involves heating the glass to an elevated temperature and holding  it for a certain period to eliminate stresses and temperature gradients, then slowly  cooling the glass to suppress stress formation, followed by more rapid cooling to  room temperature. Common annealing temperatures are around $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\left(900^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\right)$ . The  length of time the product is held at the temperature, as well as the heating and cool- ing rates during the cycle, depend on thickness of the glass, the usual rule being that  the required annealing time varies with the square of thickness.  

Annealing in modern glass factories is performed in tunnel-like furnaces, called  lehrs , in which the products ﬂ  ow slowly through the hot chamber on conveyors.  Burners are located only at the front end of the chamber, so that the glass experi- ences the required heating and cooling cycle.  

Tempered Glass and Related Products  A beneﬁ  cial internal stress pattern can be  developed in glass products by a heat treatment known as  tempering , and the result- ing material is called  tempered glass . As in the treatment of hardened steel, tempering  increases the toughness of glass. The process involves heating the glass to a tempera- ture somewhat above its annealing temperature and into the plastic range, followed by  quenching of the surfaces, usually with air jets. When the surfaces cool, they contract  and harden while the interior is still plastic and compliant. As the internal glass slowly  cools, it contracts, thus putting the hard surfaces in compression. Like other ceramics,  glass is much stronger when subjected to compressive stresses than tensile stresses. Ac- cordingly, tempered glass is much more resistant to scratching and breaking because  of the compressive stresses on its surfaces. Applications include windows for tall build- ings, all-glass doors, safety glasses, and other products requiring toughened glass.  

When tempered glass fails, it does so by shattering into numerous small frag- ments that are less likely to cut someone than conventional (annealed) window  glass.   Interestingly, automobile windshields are not made of tempered glass, because  

of the danger posed to the driver by this fragmentation. Instead, conventional glass  is used; however, it is fabricated by sandwiching two pieces of glass on either side of  a tough polymer sheet. Should this  laminated glass  fracture, the glass splinters are  retained by the polymer sheet and the windshield remains relatively transparent.  

# 12.3.2  FINISHING  

Finishing operations are sometimes required for glassware products. These sec- ondary operations include grinding, polishing, and cutting. Applications include windows for tall build- ings, all-glass doors, safety glasses, and other products requiring toughened glass.

# 12.3.2  FINISHING  

Finishing operations are sometimes required for glassware products. These sec- ondary operations include grinding, polishing, and cutting. When glass sheets are  produced by drawing and rolling, the opposite sides are not necessarily parallel, and  the surfaces contain defects and scratch marks caused by the use of hard tooling on  soft glass. The glass sheets must be ground and polished for most commercial ap- plications. In pressing and blowing operations when split dies are used, polishing is  often required to remove the seam marks from the container product.  

In continuous glassworking processes, such as plate and tube production, the con- tinuous sections must be cut into smaller pieces. This is accomplished by ﬁ  rst scoring  the glass with a glass-cutting wheel or cutting diamond and then breaking the section  along the score line. Cutting is generally done as the glass exits the annealing lehr.  

Decorative and surface processes are performed on certain glassware products.  These processes include mechanical cutting and polishing operations; sandblasting;  chemical etching (with hydroﬂ  uoric acid, often in combination with other chemi- cals); and coating (for example, coating of plate glass with aluminum or silver to  produce mirrors).

This has good impact resistance and does not splinter when broken.","The material commonly used to make windshields for automobiles is laminated glass. Laminated glass consists of two pieces of conventional (annealed) glass with a tough polymer sheet sandwiched between them.

However, the threads should be coarse. Another glass fiber material is S- glass, which has higher strength but is not as economical as E-glass. Compositions are  indicated in the table.  

Insulating fiberglass wool can be manufactured from regular soda-lime-silica  glasses. The glass product for fiber optics consists of a long, continuous core of glass  with high refractive index surrounded by a sheath of lower refractive glass. The in-  side glass must have a very high transmittance for light in order to accomplish long  distance communication.  

Optical Glasses  Applications for these glasses include lenses for eyeglasses and  optical instruments such as cameras, microscopes, and telescopes. To achieve their  function, the glasses must have different refractive indices, but each lens must be  homogenous in composition. Optical glasses are generally divided into: crowns and  flints.  Crown glass  has a low index of refraction, while  flint glass  contains lead oxide  (PbO) that gives it a high index of refraction.  

# 7.4.3  GLASS- CERAMICS  

Glass-ceramics are a class of ceramic material produced by conversion of glass into   a  polycrystalline structure through heat treatment. The proportion of crystalline phase  in the final product typically ranges between $90\%$  and $98\%$ , with the remain- der being  unconverted vitreous material. Grain size is usually between 0.1 and  $1.0\ m\mathrm{m}$  (4 and 40  $m$ -in), significantly smaller than the grain size of conventional ceramics. This fine  crystal microstructure makes glass-ceramics much stronger than the glasses from  which they are derived. Also, due to their crystal structure, glass-ceramics are opaque  (usually gray or white) rather than clear.  

The processing sequence for glass-ceramics is as follows: (1) The first step in-  volves heating and forming operations used in glassworking (Section 12.2) to create  the desired product geometry. Glass shaping methods are generally more economi- cal  than pressing and sintering to shape traditional and new ceramics made from powders.  (2) The product is cooled. (3) The glass is reheated to a temperature suf- ficient to cause  a dense network of crystal nuclei to form throughout the material. It is the high density  of nucleation sites that inhibits grain growth of individual crystals, thus leading  ultimately to the fine grain size in the glass-ceramic material. The key to the propensity  for nucleation is the presence of small amounts of nucleating agents in the glass  composition. Common nucleating agents are  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ ,  $\mathrm{P}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{5}$ , and  $\mathrm{ZrO}_{2}$ . (4) Once  nucleation is initiated, the heat treatment is continued at a higher temperature to cause  growth of the crystalline phases.  

Several examples of glass-ceramic systems and typical compositions are listed  in Table 7.5. The  $\mathrm{Li}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{-}\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\mathrm{-}\mathrm{SiO}$ 2  system is the most important commercially; it  includes Corning Ware (Pyroceram), the familiar product of the Corning Glass Works.

The significant advantages of glass-ceramics include (1) efficiency of processing  in the glassy state, (2) close dimensional control over the final product shape, and (3)  good  mechanical and physical properties. Properties include high strength (stronger than  glass), absence of porosity, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and high re-  sistance to thermal shock. These properties have resulted in applications in cooking  ware, heat exchangers, and missile radomes. Certain systems (e.g.,  $\mathrm{MgO-Al_{2}O_{3}-S i O}$ 2 system) are also characterized by high electrical resistance, suitable for electrical  and electronics applications.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec12.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/Sec7.txt","0.8290009016513892, 0.8084522685169003"

1. **Transparency and Optical Properties**: Glass is valued for its transparency and optical qualities, making it suitable for applications requiring light transmittance and magnification.

2. **Compressive Strength**: Glass is significantly stronger in compression than in tension. Designs should focus on placing glass under compressive rather than tensile stresses to avoid fracture.

3. **Brittleness**: Due to its brittleness, glass should not be used in applications with high impact loads or stresses, which might lead to breaking.

4. **Thermal Shock Resistance**: Glasses with low thermal expansion coefficients are ideal for applications subject to thermal shock, such as cookware.

5. **Stress Concentration**: To prevent stress concentration, both outside and inside corners should have large radii or chamfers, reducing the risk of breakage.

# 7.4.1 CHEMISTRY AND PROPERTIES OF GLASS  

The principal ingredient in virtually all glasses is  silica  $(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ ), most commonly found  as the mineral quartz in sandstone and silica sand. Quartz occurs naturally as a crys-  talline substance; but when melted and then cooled, it forms vitreous silica. Silica glass  has a very low thermal expansion coefficient and is therefore quite resistant to  thermal shock. These properties are ideal for elevated temperature applications;  accordingly, Pyrex and chemical glassware designed for heating are made with high  proportions of silica glass.  

In order to reduce the melting point of glass for easier processing, and to con-  trol properties, the composition of most commercial glasses includes other oxides  as well as silica. Silica remains as the main component in these glass products, usu-  ally comprising  $50\%$  to  $75\%$  of total chemistry. The reason  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  is used so widely  in these compositions is because it is the best  glass former . It naturally transforms into  a glassy state upon cooling from the liquid, whereas most ceramics crystallize upon  solidification. Table 7.4 lists typical chemistries for some common glasses. The  additional ingredients are contained in a solid solution with  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ , and each has a  function: (1) acting as flux (promoting fusion) during heating; (2) increasing fluidity  in the molten glass for processing; (3) retarding  devitrification —the tendency to  crystallize from the glassy state; (4) reducing thermal expansion in the final product;   (5) improving the chemical resistance against attack by acids, basic substances, or  water; (6) adding color to the glass; and (7) altering the index of refraction for opti-  cal applications (e.g., lenses).  

# 7.4.2  GLASS  PRODUCTS  

Following is a list of the major categories of glass products. The roles played by the  different ingredients are examined in Table 7.4 as these products are discussed.  

Window Glass  This glass is represented by two chemistries in Table 7.4: (1) soda-  lime glass and (2) window glass. The soda-lime formula dates back to the glass-blow-  ing industry of the 1800s and earlier. It was (and is) made by mixing soda  $\mathrm{(Na_{2}O)}$  and  lime (CaO) with silica $\left(\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\right)$  as the major ingredient. The blending of ingredients has  evolved empirically to achieve a balance between avoiding crystallization during

What are the functions of a well-designed electronics package?,"Answer. The principal functions are: (1) power distribution and signal interconnection, (2) structural support, (3) environmental protection, (4) heat dissipation, (5) minimize delays in signal transmission.","A well-designed electronics package serves several key functions:

1. **Power Distribution and Signal Interconnection**: It ensures efficient distribution of power and signals among components. Proper interconnections facilitate communication between the ICs and other electronic parts within the system and with external devices.

2. **Structural Support**: The package provides mechanical support to the components, maintaining their positions and orientations. This ensures reliability and durability of the system during both operation and transportation.

3. **Circuit Protection**: It protects the electronic circuits from physical damage (e.g., vibration, shock) and environmental hazards like moisture, dust, and corrosive elements, thus enhancing the longevity and performance of the system.

4. **Heat Dissipation**: Electronic circuits generate heat during operation. Effective packaging helps dissipate this heat, preventing overheating that could damage components or degrade performance.

5. **Minimizing Signal Delays**: By optimizing the layout and design of connections, the package minimizes delays in signal transmission, ensuring high-speed performance and efficiency in processing tasks.

These functions collectively contribute to the performance, reliability, and longevity of modern electronic systems.","# Electronics  Assembly and  Packaging

Integrated circuits constitute the brains of an electronic  system, but the complete system consists of much more  than packaged ICs. The ICs and other components are  mounted and interconnected on printed circuit boards,  which in turn are interconnected and contained in a  chassis or cabinet. Chip packaging (Section 33.6) is  only part of the total electronic package. This chapter  considers the remaining levels of packaging and how  the packages are manufactured and assembled.  

# Electronics  Packaging  

The electronics package is the physical means by which  the components in a system are electrically inter- connected and interfaced to external devices; it includes  the mechanical structure that holds and protects the  circuitry. A well-designed electronics package serves  the following functions: (1) power distribution and sig- nal interconnection, (2) structural support, (3) circuit  protection from physical and chemical hazards in the  environment, (4) dissipation of heat generated by the  circuits, and (5) minimum delays in signal transmission  within the system.  

For complex systems containing many components  and interconnections, the electronics package is organ- ized into levels that comprise a  packaging hierarchy ,  illus  trated in Figure 34.1 and summarized in Table 34.1.  The lowest level is the  zero level , which refers to the  intra connections on the semiconductor chip. The pack- aged chip (chip carrier), consisting of the IC in a plas- tic or ceramic enclosure and connected to the package  leads, constitutes the  ﬁ  rst level of packaging .  

Packaged chips and other components are assembled  to a printed circuit board (PCB) using two technologies  (Section 33.6.1): (1)  surface-mount technology  (SMT)  

![](images/1e20e72922781b4cf2ccd18b84212143ea7a904759ad35c3b86dcb235827b20d.jpg)  

and (2)  through-hole technology , also known as  pin-in-hole  (PIH) technology. Today,  SMT is much more widely used in industry, especially for mass-produced products.  The chip package styles and assembly techniques are different for SMT and PIH. In  many cases, both assembly technologies are employed in the same board. Printed cir- cuit board assembly represents the  second level of packaging . Figure 34.2 shows two  PCB assemblies, illustrating both PIH and SMT types. Note the smaller component  sizes of the SMT board.

The assembled PCBs are, in turn, connected to a chassis or other framework; this  is the  third level of packaging . This third level may consist of a  rack  that holds the  boards, using wire cables to make the interconnections. In major electronic systems,  such as large computers, the PCBs are typically mounted onto a larger printed cir- cuit board called a  back plane , which has conduction paths to permit interconnec- tion between the smaller boards attached to it. #  IC Packaging  

After all of the processing steps on the wafer have been completed, a ﬁ  nal series of  operations must be accomplished to transform the wafer into individual chips, ready  to connect to external circuits and prepared to withstand the harsh environment of  the world outside the clean room. These ﬁ  nal steps are referred to as IC packaging.  

Packaging of integrated circuits is concerned with design issues such as (1) electrical  connections to external circuits; (2) materials to encase the chip and protect it from the  environment (humidity, corrosion, temperature, vibration, mechanical shock); (3) heat  dissipation; (4) performance, reliability, and service life; and (5) cost.  

There are also manufacturing issues in packaging, including: (1) chip separation— cutting the wafer into individual chips, (2) connecting it to the package, (3) encapsulat- ing the chip, and (4) circuit testing. The manufacturing issues are the ones of greatest  interest in this section. Although most of the design issues are properly left to other  texts [8], [11], [13], and [15], some of the engineering aspects of IC packages, also known  as  chip carriers , and the types of packages are discussed here, before describing the  processing steps to make them.  

# 33.6.1  IC PACKAGE DESIGN  

This section considers three topics related to the design of an integrated circuit  package: (1) the number of input/output terminals required for an IC of a given size,  (2) the materials used in IC packages, and (3) package styles.  

Determining the Number of Input/Output Terminals   The basic engineering  problem in IC packaging is to connect the many internal circuits to input/output  (I/O) terminals so that the appropriate electrical signals can be communicated

between the IC and the outside world. As the number of devices in an IC in- creases, the required number of I/O terminals (leads) also increases. The problem  is of course aggravated by trends in semiconductor technology that have led to  decreases in device size and increases in the number of devices that can be packed  into an IC. Fortunately, the number of I/O terminals does not have to equal the  number of devices in the IC. The dependency between the two values is given by  Rent’s rule, named after the IBM engineer (E. F. Rent) who deﬁ  ned the following  relationship around 1960:  

$$
n_{i o}=C\,n_{i c}{}^{m}
$$  

where $n_{i o}=$  the required number of input/output terminals or external signal connec- tions; $n_{i c}=$  the number of internal circuits in the IC, usually taken to be the number  of logic gates; and  $C$  and $m$  are parameters in the equation.  

The parameters in Rent’s rule depend on the type of circuit and the design of the  IC. Memory devices require far fewer  $\mathrm{I}/\mathrm{O}$  terminals than microprocessors due to  their column and row structures. Typical values of the Constant  $C$  and exponent $m$ for several common integrated circuit devices are listed in Table 33.4.

Identify the levels of packaging hierarchy in electronics.,"Answer. The levels are: (0) chip intraconnections, (1) chip to package, (2) component to PCB, (3) PCB to rack or chassis, and (4) wiring and cabling inside a cabinet.","The packaging hierarchy in electronics consists of the following levels:

**Level 0: Intraconnections on the Chip**
- This is the intra-chip level where the connections are made within the semiconductor chip itself. It involves the metal connections that link the transistors and other components inside the chip.

**Level 1: Chip-to-Package Interconnections**
- At this level, the semiconductor chip is connected to the package (chip carrier). This involves connecting the chip's I/O terminals to the package leads, typically using techniques like wire bonding or flip-chip bonding.

**Level 2: IC Package to Circuit Board Interconnections**
- The integrated circuit (IC) package is assembled onto a printed circuit board (PCB). This level involves mounting and soldering processes using technologies like Surface-Mount Technology (SMT) and Through-Hole Technology (TH).

**Level 3: Circuit Board to Rack**
- This level involves integrating the PCBs into a larger system, typically using racks or card-on-board techniques. Interconnections are often made using backplanes and connectors.

**Level 4: Wiring and Cabling Connections in Cabinet**
- At the highest level, the entire electronic system is housed within a cabinet or chassis. This involves wiring and cabling the components to facilitate power distribution, signal routing, and interfacing with external systems.

These levels collectively facilitate efficient power distribution, structural support, protection, heat dissipation, and signal transmission in electronic systems.","# Electronics  Assembly and  Packaging

Integrated circuits constitute the brains of an electronic  system, but the complete system consists of much more  than packaged ICs. The ICs and other components are  mounted and interconnected on printed circuit boards,  which in turn are interconnected and contained in a  chassis or cabinet. Chip packaging (Section 33.6) is  only part of the total electronic package. This chapter  considers the remaining levels of packaging and how  the packages are manufactured and assembled.  

# Electronics  Packaging  

The electronics package is the physical means by which  the components in a system are electrically inter- connected and interfaced to external devices; it includes  the mechanical structure that holds and protects the  circuitry. A well-designed electronics package serves  the following functions: (1) power distribution and sig- nal interconnection, (2) structural support, (3) circuit  protection from physical and chemical hazards in the  environment, (4) dissipation of heat generated by the  circuits, and (5) minimum delays in signal transmission  within the system.  

For complex systems containing many components  and interconnections, the electronics package is organ- ized into levels that comprise a  packaging hierarchy ,  illus  trated in Figure 34.1 and summarized in Table 34.1.  The lowest level is the  zero level , which refers to the  intra connections on the semiconductor chip. The pack- aged chip (chip carrier), consisting of the IC in a plas- tic or ceramic enclosure and connected to the package  leads, constitutes the  ﬁ  rst level of packaging .  

Packaged chips and other components are assembled  to a printed circuit board (PCB) using two technologies  (Section 33.6.1): (1)  surface-mount technology  (SMT)  

![](images/1e20e72922781b4cf2ccd18b84212143ea7a904759ad35c3b86dcb235827b20d.jpg)  

and (2)  through-hole technology , also known as  pin-in-hole  (PIH) technology. Today,  SMT is much more widely used in industry, especially for mass-produced products.  The chip package styles and assembly techniques are different for SMT and PIH. In  many cases, both assembly technologies are employed in the same board. Printed cir- cuit board assembly represents the  second level of packaging . Figure 34.2 shows two  PCB assemblies, illustrating both PIH and SMT types. Note the smaller component  sizes of the SMT board.

The assembled PCBs are, in turn, connected to a chassis or other framework; this  is the  third level of packaging . This third level may consist of a  rack  that holds the  boards, using wire cables to make the interconnections. In major electronic systems,  such as large computers, the PCBs are typically mounted onto a larger printed cir- cuit board called a  back plane , which has conduction paths to permit interconnec- tion between the smaller boards attached to it. #  IC Packaging  

After all of the processing steps on the wafer have been completed, a ﬁ  nal series of  operations must be accomplished to transform the wafer into individual chips, ready  to connect to external circuits and prepared to withstand the harsh environment of  the world outside the clean room. These ﬁ  nal steps are referred to as IC packaging.  

Packaging of integrated circuits is concerned with design issues such as (1) electrical  connections to external circuits; (2) materials to encase the chip and protect it from the  environment (humidity, corrosion, temperature, vibration, mechanical shock); (3) heat  dissipation; (4) performance, reliability, and service life; and (5) cost.  

There are also manufacturing issues in packaging, including: (1) chip separation— cutting the wafer into individual chips, (2) connecting it to the package, (3) encapsulat- ing the chip, and (4) circuit testing. The manufacturing issues are the ones of greatest  interest in this section. Although most of the design issues are properly left to other  texts [8], [11], [13], and [15], some of the engineering aspects of IC packages, also known  as  chip carriers , and the types of packages are discussed here, before describing the  processing steps to make them.

What is the difference between a track and a land on a printed circuit board?,"Answer. A track is a copper conducting path on a PCB, while a land is a small copper area for electrically attaching components.","On a printed circuit board (PCB), a ""track"" and a ""land"" refer to different parts of the copper conducting paths:

- **Track**: A track is a thin line of copper on the PCB that provides electrical connectivity between components. Tracks act as the ""wires"" on the board, allowing electrical signals to pass between various components. They are typically routed across the PCB surface and are crucial for forming the necessary circuits.

- **Land**: A land, also known as a pad, is an area of copper on the PCB where components are actually attached and soldered. Lands provide the contact points for soldering the leads of through-hole or surface-mount components, ensuring they are securely affixed to the board and electrically connected to the relevant tracks.

In summary, tracks are the paths that connect different components, while lands are the connection points where components attach to the board.","As track  widths became ﬁ  ner and ﬁ  ner, photolithography was  substituted for screen printing.  

Initial techniques to design the circuit masks involved  a manual inking procedure, in which the designer at- tempted to route the conducting tracks to provide the  required connections and avoid short circuits on a large  sheet of paper or vellum. This became more difﬁ  cult as  the number of components on the board increased and  the conducting lines interconnecting the components  became ﬁ  ner. Computer programs were developed to  aid the designer in solving the routing problem. How- ever, in many cases, it was impossible to ﬁ  nd a solu- tion with no intersecting tracks (short circuits). To solve  the problem, jumper wires were hand-soldered to the  board to make these connections. As the number of  jumper wires increased, the problem of human error  again appeared. Multilayer printed circuit boards were  introduced to deal with this routing issue.

# 34.2.1  STRUCTURES, TYPES, AND MATERIALS FOR PCBs  

A  printed circuit board  (PCB), also called a  printed wiring board  (PWB), is a  laminated ﬂ  at panel of insulating material designed to provide electrical intercon- nections between electronic components attached to it. Interconnections are made  by thin conducting paths on the surface of the board or in alternating layers sand- wiched between layers of insulating material. The conducting paths are made of  copper and are called  tracks . Other copper areas, called  lands , are also available  on the board surface for attaching and electrically connecting components.  

Insulation materials in PCBs are usually polymer composites reinforced with  glass fabrics or paper. Polymers include epoxy (most widely used), phenolic, and  polyimide. E-glass is the usual ﬁ  ber in glass-reinforcing fabrics, especially in epoxy  PCBs; cotton paper is a common reinforcing layer for phenolic boards. The usual  thickness of the substrate layer is 0.8 to  $3.2~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.031–0.125 in), and copper foil  thickness is around  $0.04~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.0015 in). The materials forming the PCB structure  must be electrically insulating, strong and rigid, resistant to warpage, dimensionally

stable, heat resistant, and ﬂ  ame retardant. Chemicals are often added to the polymer  composite to obtain the last two characteristics.  

There are three principal types of printed circuit board, shown in Figure 34.3:  (a)  single-sided  board, in which copper foil is only on one side of the insulation  substrate; (b)  double-sided  board, in which the copper foil is on both sides of the  substrate; and (c)  multilayer  board, consisting of alternating layers of conducting  foil and insulation. In all three structures, the insulation layers are constructed of  multiple laminates of epoxy-glass sheets (or other composite) bonded together to  form a strong and rigid structure. Multilayer boards are used for complex circuit  assemblies in which a large number of components must be interconnected with  many track routings, thus requiring more conducting paths than can be accommo- dated in one or two copper layers. Four layers is the most common multilayer con- ﬁ  guration, but boards with up to 24 conducting layers are produced.  

# 34.2.2  PRODUCTION OF THE STARTING BOARDS  

Single- and double-sided boards can be purchased from suppliers that specialize  in mass producing them in standard sizes. The boards are then custom-processed  by a circuit fabricator to create the speciﬁ  ed circuit pattern and board size for  a given application. Multilayer boards are fabricated from standard single- and  double-sided boards. Upper PCB  assembly is through- hole technology  (pin-in-hole) whereas  lower assembly is  mostly surface-mount  technology. (Courtesy  of George E. Kane  Manufacturing  Technology Laboratory,  Lehigh University.)  

The assembled PCBs are, in turn, connected to a chassis or other framework; this  is the  third level of packaging . This third level may consist of a  rack  that holds the  boards, using wire cables to make the interconnections. In major electronic systems,  such as large computers, the PCBs are typically mounted onto a larger printed cir- cuit board called a  back plane , which has conduction paths to permit interconnec- tion between the smaller boards attached to it. This latter conﬁ  guration is known as  card-on-board  (COB) packaging, in which the smaller PCBs are called cards and  the back plane is the board.  

The  fourth level of packaging  consists of wiring and cabling inside the cabinet  that contains the electronic system. For systems of relatively low complexity, the  packaging may not include all of the possible levels in the hierarchy.  

A printed circuit board consists of one or more thin sheets of insulating material,  with thin copper lines on one or both surfaces that interconnect the components  attached to the board. In boards consisting of more than one layer, copper conduct- ing paths are interleaved between the layers. PCBs are used in packaged electronic  systems to hold components, provide electrical interconnections among them, and  make connections to external circuits. They have become standard building blocks  in virtually all electronic systems that contain packaged ICs and other components  (Historical Note 34.1). PCBs are so important and widely used because (1) they  provide a convenient structural platform for the components; (2) a board with cor- rectly routed interconnections can be mass produced consistently, without the varia- bility usually associated with hand wiring; (3) nearly all of the soldering connections  between components and the PCB can be accomplished in a one-step mechanized  

# Historical Note 34.1  Printed circuit boards  

Before printed circuit boards, electrical and electronic  components were manually fastened to a sheet-metal  chassis (usually aluminum) and then hand wired and  soldered to form the desired circuit. This was called  point-to-point construction. In the late 1950s, various  plastic boards became commercially available. These  boards, which provided electrical insulation, gradually  replaced the aluminum chassis.  The ﬁ  rst plastics were  phenolics, followed by glass-ﬁ  ber-reinforced epoxies.  The boards came with predrilled holes spaced at  standard intervals in both directions. This motivated  the use of electronic components that matched these  hole spacings.  The dual-in-line package evolved during  this period.  

The components in these circuit boards were hand- wired, which proved increasingly difﬁ  cult and prone to  human error as component densities increased and cir- cuits became more complex. The printed circuit board,  with etched copper foil on its surface to form the wiring  interconnections, was developed in the 1950s to solve  these problems with manual wiring. The printed circuit  boards during that period used through-hole technology,  and PCBs had to be drilled to accommodate the com- ponent leads. The original technique for “printing” the  circuit pattern onto the copper-clad board was screen  printing. In the late 1980s, surface mount technology  began to replace through-hole construction. SMT did  not require lead holes, and the components were signi- ﬁ  cantly smaller, allowing much higher circuit densities  to be achieved on the printed circuit boards. As track  widths became ﬁ  ner and ﬁ  ner, photolithography was  substituted for screen printing.  

Initial techniques to design the circuit masks involved  a manual inking procedure, in which the designer at- tempted to route the conducting tracks to provide the  required connections and avoid short circuits on a large  sheet of paper or vellum.

Insulation materials in PCBs are usually polymer composites reinforced with  glass fabrics or paper. Polymers include epoxy (most widely used), phenolic, and  polyimide. E-glass is the usual ﬁ  ber in glass-reinforcing fabrics, especially in epoxy  PCBs; cotton paper is a common reinforcing layer for phenolic boards. The usual  thickness of the substrate layer is 0.8 to  $3.2~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.031–0.125 in), and copper foil  thickness is around  $0.04~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.0015 in). The materials forming the PCB structure  must be electrically insulating, strong and rigid, resistant to warpage, dimensionally

There are three principal types of printed circuit board, shown in Figure 34.3:  (a)  single-sided  board, in which copper foil is only on one side of the insulation  substrate; (b)  double-sided  board, in which the copper foil is on both sides of the  substrate; and (c)  multilayer  board, consisting of alternating layers of conducting  foil and insulation.

Name the three principal types of printed circuit board?,"Answer. The three types are: (1) single -sided board, (2) double -sided board, and (3) multilayer board.","The three principal types of printed circuit boards (PCBs) are:

1. **Single-sided PCB**: Copper foil is present on only one side of the insulating substrate. These are typically used in simpler electronic devices where few interconnections are needed.

2. **Double-sided PCB**: Copper foil is present on both sides of the substrate. This design allows for more connections and is commonly used in more complex circuits requiring additional routing options.

3. **Multilayer PCB**: Made up of alternating layers of copper foil and insulating substrate. Multilayer boards can contain four or more layers, with some designs having up to 24 layers. These are used for highly complex electronic systems where numerous components and connections are necessary.","As track  widths became ﬁ  ner and ﬁ  ner, photolithography was  substituted for screen printing.

# 34.2.1  STRUCTURES, TYPES, AND MATERIALS FOR PCBs  

A  printed circuit board  (PCB), also called a  printed wiring board  (PWB), is a  laminated ﬂ  at panel of insulating material designed to provide electrical intercon- nections between electronic components attached to it. Interconnections are made  by thin conducting paths on the surface of the board or in alternating layers sand- wiched between layers of insulating material. The conducting paths are made of  copper and are called  tracks . Other copper areas, called  lands , are also available  on the board surface for attaching and electrically connecting components.  

Insulation materials in PCBs are usually polymer composites reinforced with  glass fabrics or paper. Polymers include epoxy (most widely used), phenolic, and  polyimide. E-glass is the usual ﬁ  ber in glass-reinforcing fabrics, especially in epoxy  PCBs; cotton paper is a common reinforcing layer for phenolic boards. The usual  thickness of the substrate layer is 0.8 to  $3.2~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.031–0.125 in), and copper foil  thickness is around  $0.04~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.0015 in). The materials forming the PCB structure  must be electrically insulating, strong and rigid, resistant to warpage, dimensionally

stable, heat resistant, and ﬂ  ame retardant. Chemicals are often added to the polymer  composite to obtain the last two characteristics.  

There are three principal types of printed circuit board, shown in Figure 34.3:  (a)  single-sided  board, in which copper foil is only on one side of the insulation  substrate; (b)  double-sided  board, in which the copper foil is on both sides of the  substrate; and (c)  multilayer  board, consisting of alternating layers of conducting  foil and insulation. In all three structures, the insulation layers are constructed of  multiple laminates of epoxy-glass sheets (or other composite) bonded together to  form a strong and rigid structure. Multilayer boards are used for complex circuit  assemblies in which a large number of components must be interconnected with  many track routings, thus requiring more conducting paths than can be accommo- dated in one or two copper layers. Four layers is the most common multilayer con- ﬁ  guration, but boards with up to 24 conducting layers are produced.  

# 34.2.2  PRODUCTION OF THE STARTING BOARDS  

Single- and double-sided boards can be purchased from suppliers that specialize  in mass producing them in standard sizes. The boards are then custom-processed  by a circuit fabricator to create the speciﬁ  ed circuit pattern and board size for  a given application. Multilayer boards are fabricated from standard single- and  double-sided boards. Upper PCB  assembly is through- hole technology  (pin-in-hole) whereas  lower assembly is  mostly surface-mount  technology. (Courtesy  of George E. Kane  Manufacturing  Technology Laboratory,  Lehigh University.)  

The assembled PCBs are, in turn, connected to a chassis or other framework; this  is the  third level of packaging . This third level may consist of a  rack  that holds the  boards, using wire cables to make the interconnections. In major electronic systems,  such as large computers, the PCBs are typically mounted onto a larger printed cir- cuit board called a  back plane , which has conduction paths to permit interconnec- tion between the smaller boards attached to it. This latter conﬁ  guration is known as  card-on-board  (COB) packaging, in which the smaller PCBs are called cards and  the back plane is the board.  

The  fourth level of packaging  consists of wiring and cabling inside the cabinet  that contains the electronic system. For systems of relatively low complexity, the  packaging may not include all of the possible levels in the hierarchy.  

A printed circuit board consists of one or more thin sheets of insulating material,  with thin copper lines on one or both surfaces that interconnect the components  attached to the board. In boards consisting of more than one layer, copper conduct- ing paths are interleaved between the layers. PCBs are used in packaged electronic  systems to hold components, provide electrical interconnections among them, and  make connections to external circuits. They have become standard building blocks  in virtually all electronic systems that contain packaged ICs and other components  (Historical Note 34.1). PCBs are so important and widely used because (1) they  provide a convenient structural platform for the components; (2) a board with cor- rectly routed interconnections can be mass produced consistently, without the varia- bility usually associated with hand wiring; (3) nearly all of the soldering connections  between components and the PCB can be accomplished in a one-step mechanized

Before printed circuit boards, electrical and electronic  components were manually fastened to a sheet-metal  chassis (usually aluminum) and then hand wired and  soldered to form the desired circuit. This was called  point-to-point construction. In the late 1950s, various  plastic boards became commercially available. These  boards, which provided electrical insulation, gradually  replaced the aluminum chassis.  The ﬁ  rst plastics were  phenolics, followed by glass-ﬁ  ber-reinforced epoxies.  The boards came with predrilled holes spaced at  standard intervals in both directions. This motivated  the use of electronic components that matched these  hole spacings.  The dual-in-line package evolved during  this period.  

The components in these circuit boards were hand- wired, which proved increasingly difﬁ  cult and prone to  human error as component densities increased and cir- cuits became more complex. The printed circuit board,  with etched copper foil on its surface to form the wiring  interconnections, was developed in the 1950s to solve  these problems with manual wiring.

What is a via hole in a printed circuit board?,Answer. A via hole is a hole in the printed circuit board whose sides are plated with copper to serve as a conducting path from one side of a PCB to the other or between intermediate layers in a multilayer board.,"A via hole in a printed circuit board (PCB) is a small hole that allows electrical connections to be made between different layers of a multilayer PCB. These holes are essential for the functionality of multilayer boards, where electrical circuits are distributed over multiple layers to increase the density of connections and reduce the board size. Via holes are drilled into the board and can be plated to ensure a reliable electrical connection between the conductive layers. They are distinct from through-holes used in through-hole technology, which typically involve inserting component leads through the hole. In contrast, via holes are much smaller and serve only to interconnect layers within the board without accommodating component leads. Via holes enable complex routing of electrical signals, significantly enhancing the PCB's capability to integrate dense and complex circuitry, especially in high-performance and miniaturized electronic applications.","Upper PCB  assembly is through- hole technology  (pin-in-hole) whereas  lower assembly is  mostly surface-mount  technology.

To solve  the problem, jumper wires were hand-soldered to the  board to make these connections. The setup consists of an array  of probes that are forced under light pressure to make contact with speciﬁ  ed points  on the board surface. Electrical connections between contact points can be quickly  checked in this procedure.  

Several additional processing steps must be performed on the bare board to pre- pare it for assembly. The ﬁ  rst of these ﬁ  nishing operations is the application of a thin  solder layer on the track and land surfaces. This layer serves to protect the copper  from oxidation and contamination. It is carried out either by electroplating or by  bringing the copper side into contact with rotating rollers that are partially sub- mersed in molten solder.  

A second operation involves application of a coating of solder resist to all areas of  the board surface except the lands that are to be subsequently soldered in assembly.  The solder resist coating is chemically formulated to resist adhesion of solder; thus,  in the subsequent soldering processes, solder adheres only to land areas. Solder resist  is usually applied by screen printing.  

Finally, an identiﬁ  cation legend is printed onto the surface, again by screen print- ing. The legend indicates where the different components are to be placed on the  board in ﬁ  nal assembly. In modern industrial practice, a bar code is also printed on  the board for production control purposes.  

#  Printed Circuit Board Assembly  

A printed circuit board assembly consists of electronic components (e.g., IC pack- ages, resistors, capacitors) as well as mechanical components (e.g., fasteners, heat  sinks) mounted on a printed circuit board. This is level 2 in electronic packaging  (Table 34.1). As indicated, PCB assembly is based on either surface-mount techno- logy (SMT) or through-hole technology (see Figure 34.2). Some PCB assemblies  include both SMT and through-hole components. The discussion in this section  covers both categories as well as combinations of the two. The scope of electronic  assembly also includes higher packaging levels such as assemblies of multiple  PCBs electrically connected and mechanically contained in a chassis or cabinet.  Section 34.4 explores the technologies by which electrical connections are made at  these higher levels.  

# 34.3.1  SURFACE MOUNT TECHNOLOGY  

Since the late 1980s, the use of surface mount technology has grown to the point  where it is now the dominant process in printed circuit board assembly. The earlier  through-hole technology has the following inherent limitations in terms of packing  density: (1) components can be mounted on only one side of the board, and (2) center- to-center distance between lead pins in leaded components must be a minimum of  $1.0\:\mathrm{mm}\:(0.04\:\mathrm{in})$  and is usually $2.5\,\mathrm{mm}\,(0.10\,\mathrm{in})$ .  

Surface-mount technology uses an assembly method in which component leads  are soldered to lands on the surface of the board rather than into holes running  through the board (Historical Note 34.2). By eliminating the need for leads inserted  into through holes in the board, several advantages are gained: (1) smaller compo- nents are available, with leads closer together; (2) circuit densities can be increased;  (3) components can be mounted on both sides of the board; (4) smaller PCBs can be  used for the same electronic system; and (5) drilling of the many through holes dur- ing board fabrication is eliminated although via holes to interconnect layers are still  required [6]. Typical areas on the board surface taken by SMT components range  between $20\%$  and $60\%$  compared to through-hole components.  

# Historical Note 34.2  Surface-mount technology  

Printed circuit board assemblies based on through- hole technology were the predominant electronics  packaging method from the 1950s through most of the  1980s, when surface-mount technology (SMT) started  to be widely used.  

SMT traces its origins to the electronic systems  in the aerospace and military industries of the 1960s,  with the IBM Corporation responsible for much of  the original development work. The ﬁ  rst components  were small, ﬂ  at ceramic packages with gull-wing  leads. The initial reason why these packages were  attrac  tive, compared with through-hole technology,  was the fact that they could be placed on both sides  of a printed circuit board—in effect, doubling the com- ponent density.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec34.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec34.txt","0.8509864604816751, 0.825698213532171"
What are the two basic resist coating methods for printed circuit boards?,"Answer. The two methods are: (1) screening, such as silk screening, and (2) photolithography.","The two basic resist coating methods for printed circuit boards are:

1. **Spin Coating**: This method involves depositing a metered amount of liquid photoresist onto the center of a rotating wafer. The centrifugal force spreads the liquid resist evenly across the surface, achieving a uniform coating thickness. Spin coating is widely used due to its ability to produce a consistent layer, critical for achieving high-resolution patterns.

2. **Roller Coating**: This technique uses rollers to apply the photoresist evenly across the board surface. It is typically used for larger substrates or when handling multiple boards simultaneously. Roller coating is effective for achieving uniform coverage and is suitable for mass production where speed is necessary.

Both methods are chosen based on specific application requirements, such as the desired uniformity and thickness of the resist layer, as well as the scale of production.","Two types of photoresists are available: positive and negative. A  positive resist   becomes more soluble in developing solutions after exposure to light. A  negative  resist  becomes less soluble (the polymer cross-links and hardens) when exposed  to light. Figure 33.9 illustrates the operation of both resist types. Negative resists  have better adhesion to  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  and metal surfaces and good etch resistance. However,  positive resists achieve better resolution, which has made it the more widely used  technique as IC feature sizes have become smaller and smaller.  

Exposure Techniques   The resists are exposed through the mask by one of three  exposure techniques: (a) contact printing, (b) proximity printing, and (c) projection  printing, illustrated in Figure 33.10. In  contact printing , the mask is pressed against  the resist coating during exposure. This results in high resolution of the pattern onto  the wafer surface; an important disadvantage is that physical contact with the wafers  gradually wears out the mask. In  proximity printing , the mask is separated from the  resist coating by a distance of 10 to $25\ \mu\mathrm{m}$  (0.0004–0.001 in). This eliminates mask  wear, but resolution of the image is slightly reduced.  Projection printing  involves  the use of a high-quality lens (or mirror) system to project the image through the

mask onto the wafer. This has become the preferred technique because it is non- contact (thus, no mask wear), and the mask pattern can be reduced through optical  projection to obtain high resolution.  

Processing Sequence in Optical lithography  A typical processing sequence  begins with surface of the silicon having just been oxidized to form a thin ﬁ  lm of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   on the wafer. It is desired to remove the  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  ﬁ  lm in certain regions as deﬁ  ned by  the mask pattern. The sequence for a positive resist proceeds as follows, illustrated  in Figure 33.11. (1)  Prepare surface . The wafer is properly cleaned to promote wett- ing and adhesion of the resist. (2)  Apply photoresist . In semiconductor processing,  photoresists are applied by feeding a metered amount of liquid resist onto the center  of the wafer and then spinning the wafer to spread the liquid and achieve a uni- form coating thickness. Desired thickness is around  $1\ \mu\mathrm{m}$  (0.00004 in), which gives  good resolution yet minimizes pinhole defects. (3)  Soft-bake . The purpose of this  

![](images/f69f89972de26676ed43c5d9012a2da83f77c330e2d3aef80fe7c9f3a8a8b613.jpg)  
FIGURE 33.11  Optical  lithography process  applied to a silicon  wafer: (1) prepare  surface; (2) apply pho- toresist; (3) soft-bake;  (4) align mask and  expose; (5) develop  resist; (6) hard-bake;  (7) etch; (8) strip resist.  

pre-exposure bake is to remove solvents, promote adhesion, and harden the resist.  Typical soft-bake temperatures are around $90^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(190^{\mathrm{o}}\mathrm{F})$  for 10 to $20\,\mathrm{{min}}$ . (4)  Align  mask and expose . The pattern mask is aligned relative to the wafer and the resist  is exposed through the mask by one of the methods described above. Alignment  must be accomplished with very high precision, using optical-mechanical equipment  designed speciﬁ  cally for the purpose. If the wafer has been previously processed by  lithography so that a pattern has already been formed in the wafer, then sub  sequent  masks must be accurately registered relative to the existing pattern. The interconnection is accomplished by means of copper-plated via holes that run  from lands on one surface of the board to lands on the opposite surface, as shown  in Figure 34.4. A typical fabrication sequence for a double-sided board (copper- clad on both sides) uses the semiadditive method. After hole drilling, electroless  plating is used to initially plate the holes, followed by electroplating to increase  plating thickness.  

A  multilayer board  is structurally the most complex of the three types, and this  complexity is reﬂ  ected in its manufacturing sequence. The laminated construction can  be seen in Figure 34.8, which highlights some of the features of a multilayer PCB.  The fabrication steps for the individual layers are basically the same as those used  for single- and double-sided boards. What makes multilayer board fabrication more  complicated is that (1) all of the layers, each with its own circuit design, must ﬁ  rst be  processed; then (2) the layers must be joined together to form one integral board; and  ﬁ  nally (3) the assembled board must itself be put through its own processing sequence.  

A multilayer board consists of  logic layers , which carry electrical signals between  components on the board, and  voltage layers , which are used to distribute power.  Logic layers are generally fabricated from double-sided boards, whereas voltage  layers are usually made from single-sided boards. Thinner insulating substrates  are used for multi  layer boards than for their standalone single- and double-sided  counter  parts, so that a suitable thickness of the ﬁ  nal board can be achieved.  

In the second stage, the individual layers are assembled together. The procedure  starts with copper foil on the bottom outside, and then adds the individual layers,  separating one from the next by one or more sheets of glass fabric impregnated with  partially cured epoxy. After all layers have been sandwiched together, a ﬁ  nal copper  foil is placed on the stack to form the top outer layer. Layers are then bonded into a  single board by heating the assembly under pressure to cure the epoxy. After curing,  any excess resin squeezed out of the sandwich around the edges is trimmed away.  

At the start of the third stage of fabrication, the board consists of multiple layers  bonded together, with copper foil cladded on its outer surfaces. Its construction can  therefore be likened to that of a double-sided board; and its processing is likewise  similar. The sequence consists of drilling additional through-holes, plating the holes  to establish conduction paths between the two exterior copper ﬁ  lms as well as cer- tain internal copper layers, and the use of photolithography and etching to form the  circuit pattern on the outer copper surfaces.  

Testing and Finishing Operations  After a circuit has been fabricated on the  board surface, it must be inspected and tested to ensure that it functions according  to design speciﬁ  cations and contains no quality defects. Two procedures are com- mon: (1) visual inspection and (2) continuity testing. In  visual inspection , the board  is examined visually to detect open and short circuits, errors in drilled hole loca- tions, and other faults that can be observed without applying electrical power to the  board. Visual inspections, performed not only after fabrication but also at various  critical stages during production, are accomplished by human eye or machine vision  (Section 40.6.3).  

Continuity testing  involves the use of contact probes brought simultaneously into  contact with track and land areas on the board surface. The setup consists of an array  of probes that are forced under light pressure to make contact with speciﬁ  ed points  on the board surface. Electrical connections between contact points can be quickly  checked in this procedure.  

Several additional processing steps must be performed on the bare board to pre- pare it for assembly. The ﬁ  rst of these ﬁ  nishing operations is the application of a thin  solder layer on the track and land surfaces. This layer serves to protect the copper  from oxidation and contamination. It is carried out either by electroplating or by  bringing the copper side into contact with rotating rollers that are partially sub- mersed in molten solder.  

A second operation involves application of a coating of solder resist to all areas of  the board surface except the lands that are to be subsequently soldered in assembly.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec33.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec34.txt","0.8412289415670445, 0.8292676332538047"
What is etching used for in PCB fabrication?,Answer. Etching is used to remove copper cladding on the PCB surface to define the tracks and lands of the circuit.,"In PCB fabrication, etching is used to remove unneeded copper from the surface of a copper-clad board to create the desired circuit pattern. This process involves selectively dissolving the copper cladding in areas not protected by a resist, leaving behind copper tracks and lands that form the interconnections for an electrical circuit. Etching is a critical step that transforms the solid copper film into functional pathways for electrical signals, aligning with the circuit design. The process must be carefully controlled to prevent over-etching or under-etching, ensuring precision and reliability in the final PCB.","Etching  removes the copper cladding in the unprotected regions from the board  surface, usually by means of a chemical etchant. Etching is the step that transforms  the solid copper ﬁ  lm into the interconnections for an electrical circuit.  

Etching is done in an etching chamber in which the etchant is sprayed onto the  surface of the board that is now partially coated with resist. Various etchants are  used to remove copper, including ammonium persulfate  $\mathrm{((NH_{4})_{2}S_{2}O_{4})}$ , ammonium  hydroxide  $\mathrm{(NH_{4}O H)}$ , cupric chloride  $\left(\operatorname{CuCl}_{2}\right)$ , and ferric chloride  $\left(\mathrm{{FeCl}}_{3}\right)$ . Each has  its relative advantages and disadvantages. Process parameters (e.g., temperature,  etchant concentration, and duration) must be closely controlled to avoid over- or  under-etching, as in IC fabrication. After etching, the board must be rinsed and the  remaining resist chemically stripped from the surface.  

Plating   In printed circuit boards, plating is needed on the hole surfaces to provide  conductive paths from one side to the other in double-sided boards, or between layers  in multilayer boards. Two types of plating process are used in PCB fabrication: electro- plating and electroless plating (Section 27.3). Electroplating has a higher deposition  rate than electroless plating but requires that the coated surface be metallic (conduc- tive). Electroless plating is slower but does not require a conductive surface.  

After drilling of the via holes and insertion holes, the walls of the holes consist  of epoxy-glass insulation material, which is nonconductive. Accordingly, electroless  plating must be used initially to provide a thin coating of copper on the hole walls.  Once the thin ﬁ  lm of copper has been applied, electrolytic plating is then used to  increase coating thickness on the hole surfaces to between 0.025 and $0.05\,\mathrm{mm}$  (0.001  and 0.002 in).  

Gold is another metal sometimes plated onto printed circuit boards. It is used as  a very thin coating on PCB edge connectors to provide superior electrical contact.  Coating thickness is only about $2.5\;\mu\mathrm{m}$  (0.0001 in).

# 34.2.4  PCB FABRICATION SEQUENCE  

This section describes the processing sequence for various board types. The sequence  is concerned with transforming a copper-clad board of reinforced polymer into a  printed circuit board, a procedure called  circuitization . The desired result is illus- trated in Figure 34.4 for a double-sided board.  

Circuitization   Three methods of circuitization can be used to determine which  regions of the board will be coated with copper [13]: (1) subtractive, (2) additive, and  (3) semiadditive.  

In the  subtractive method , open portions of the copper cladding on the starting  board are etched away from the surface, so that the tracks and lands of the desired  circuit remain. The process is called “subtractive” because copper is removed from  the board surface. The steps in the subtractive method are described in Figure 34.5.  

The  additive method  starts with a board surface that is not copper clad, such  as the uncoated surface of a single-sided board. However, the uncoated surface is  treated with a chemical, called a  buttercoat , which acts as the catalyst for electroless  plating. The steps in the method are outlined in Figure 34.6.  

! Cemented carbide or coated carbide are favored  over high speed steel as the tool material.  

The small hole size, combined with the stacking of several boards or multilayer  boards, result in a high depth-to-diameter ratio, aggravating the problem of chip  extraction from the hole. Other requirements placed on the operation include high  accuracy in hole location, smooth hole walls, and absence of burrs on the holes. Burrs  are usually formed when the drill enters or exits a hole; thin sheets of material are  often placed on top of and beneath the stack of boards to inhibit burr formation on  the boards themselves.  

Finally, any cutting tool must be used at a certain cutting speed to operate at best  efﬁ  ciency. For a drill bit, cutting speed is measured at the diameter. For very small  drill sizes, this means extremely high rotational speeds—up to  $100{,}000\ \mathrm{rev/min}$  in  some cases. Special spindle bearings and motors are required to achieve these speeds.  

Circuit Pattern Imaging and Etching   There are two basic methods by which  the circuit pattern is transferred to the copper surface of the board: screen printing  and photolithography. Both methods involve the use of a resist coating on the board  surface that determines where etching of the copper will occur to create the tracks  and lands of the circuit.  

Screen printing was the ﬁ  rst method used for PCBs. It is indeed a printing tech- nique, and the term  printed circuit board  can be traced to this method. In  screen print- ing , a stencil screen containing the circuit pattern is placed on the board, and liquid  resist is squeezed through the mesh to the surface beneath. This method is simple and  inexpensive, but its resolution is limited. It is normally used only for applications in  which track widths are greater than about  $0.25\:\mathrm{mm}$  (0.010 in).  

The second method of transferring the circuit pattern is  photolithography , in  which a light-sensitive resist material is exposed through a mask to transfer the cir- cuit pattern. The procedure is similar to the corresponding process in IC fabrication  (Section 33.3.1); some of the details in PCB processing will be described here.  

Photoresists used by circuit fabricators are available in two forms: liquid or  dry ﬁ  lm. Liquid resists can be applied by roller or spraying. Dry ﬁ  lm resists are  more commonly used in PCB fabrication. They consist of three layers: a ﬁ  lm  of photosensitive polymer sandwiched between a polyester support sheet on  one side and a removable plastic cover sheet on the other side. The cover sheet  prevents the photosensitive material from sticking during storage and handling.  Although more expensive than liquid resists, dry ﬁ  lm resists form coatings of  uniform thickness, and their processing in photolithography is simpler. To apply,  the cover sheet is removed, and the resist ﬁ  lm is placed on the copper surface to  which it readily adheres. Hot rollers are used to press and smooth the resist onto  the surface.  

Alignment of the masks relative to the board relies on the use of registration  holes that are aligned with the tooling holes on the board. Contact printing is used  to expose the resist beneath the mask. The resist is then developed, which involves  removal of the unexposed regions of the negative resist from the surface.  

After resist development, certain areas of the copper surface remain covered by  resist while other areas are now unprotected. The covered areas correspond to cir- cuit tracks and lands, while uncovered areas correspond to open regions between.  Etching  removes the copper cladding in the unprotected regions from the board  surface, usually by means of a chemical etchant. Etching is the step that transforms  the solid copper ﬁ  lm into the interconnections for an electrical circuit.  

Etching is done in an etching chamber in which the etchant is sprayed onto the  surface of the board that is now partially coated with resist. Various etchants are  used to remove copper, including ammonium persulfate  $\mathrm{((NH_{4})_{2}S_{2}O_{4})}$ , ammonium  hydroxide  $\mathrm{(NH_{4}O H)}$ , cupric chloride  $\left(\operatorname{CuCl}_{2}\right)$ , and ferric chloride  $\left(\mathrm{{FeCl}}_{3}\right)$ . Each has  its relative advantages and disadvantages.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec34.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec34.txt","0.8704076160757235, 0.8570975740314114"
"What is continuity testing, and when is it performed in the PCB fabrication sequence?","Answer. Continuity testing is an electrical test in which contact probes are brought into contact with track and land areas to insure the existence of electrical conduction paths. Continuity tests are generally used: (1) after the bare board has been fabricated, and (2) after the board has been populated with components.","Continuity testing is a procedure used in the fabrication and assembly of printed circuit boards (PCBs) to verify the electrical connections between different points on the board. It involves using an array of contact probes that are brought into simultaneous contact with specific track and land areas on the board surface. By applying light pressure, these probes establish connections at designated points to ensure that there are no open or short circuits in the conductive pathways of the PCB.

Continuity testing is typically performed after the circuit has been etched onto the board surface, following the fabrication of the board. It is crucial because it helps to ensure that the board functions according to design specifications by validating that all required electrical connections are present and correctly formed. This testing can be conducted after the fabrication of the circuitry on the board and also as part of the final inspection and testing processes following assembly, in order to confirm that the assembled components are properly connected and functioning.","The interconnection is accomplished by means of copper-plated via holes that run  from lands on one surface of the board to lands on the opposite surface, as shown  in Figure 34.4. A typical fabrication sequence for a double-sided board (copper- clad on both sides) uses the semiadditive method. After hole drilling, electroless  plating is used to initially plate the holes, followed by electroplating to increase  plating thickness.  

A  multilayer board  is structurally the most complex of the three types, and this  complexity is reﬂ  ected in its manufacturing sequence. The laminated construction can  be seen in Figure 34.8, which highlights some of the features of a multilayer PCB.  The fabrication steps for the individual layers are basically the same as those used  for single- and double-sided boards. What makes multilayer board fabrication more  complicated is that (1) all of the layers, each with its own circuit design, must ﬁ  rst be  processed; then (2) the layers must be joined together to form one integral board; and  ﬁ  nally (3) the assembled board must itself be put through its own processing sequence.  

A multilayer board consists of  logic layers , which carry electrical signals between  components on the board, and  voltage layers , which are used to distribute power.  Logic layers are generally fabricated from double-sided boards, whereas voltage  layers are usually made from single-sided boards. Thinner insulating substrates  are used for multi  layer boards than for their standalone single- and double-sided  counter  parts, so that a suitable thickness of the ﬁ  nal board can be achieved.  

In the second stage, the individual layers are assembled together. The procedure  starts with copper foil on the bottom outside, and then adds the individual layers,  separating one from the next by one or more sheets of glass fabric impregnated with  partially cured epoxy. After all layers have been sandwiched together, a ﬁ  nal copper  foil is placed on the stack to form the top outer layer. Layers are then bonded into a  single board by heating the assembly under pressure to cure the epoxy. After curing,  any excess resin squeezed out of the sandwich around the edges is trimmed away.  

At the start of the third stage of fabrication, the board consists of multiple layers  bonded together, with copper foil cladded on its outer surfaces. Its construction can  therefore be likened to that of a double-sided board; and its processing is likewise  similar. The sequence consists of drilling additional through-holes, plating the holes  to establish conduction paths between the two exterior copper ﬁ  lms as well as cer- tain internal copper layers, and the use of photolithography and etching to form the  circuit pattern on the outer copper surfaces.  

Testing and Finishing Operations  After a circuit has been fabricated on the  board surface, it must be inspected and tested to ensure that it functions according  to design speciﬁ  cations and contains no quality defects. Two procedures are com- mon: (1) visual inspection and (2) continuity testing. In  visual inspection , the board  is examined visually to detect open and short circuits, errors in drilled hole loca- tions, and other faults that can be observed without applying electrical power to the  board. Visual inspections, performed not only after fabrication but also at various  critical stages during production, are accomplished by human eye or machine vision  (Section 40.6.3).  

Continuity testing  involves the use of contact probes brought simultaneously into  contact with track and land areas on the board surface. The setup consists of an array  of probes that are forced under light pressure to make contact with speciﬁ  ed points  on the board surface. Electrical connections between contact points can be quickly  checked in this procedure.  

Several additional processing steps must be performed on the bare board to pre- pare it for assembly. The ﬁ  rst of these ﬁ  nishing operations is the application of a thin  solder layer on the track and land surfaces. This layer serves to protect the copper  from oxidation and contamination. It is carried out either by electroplating or by  bringing the copper side into contact with rotating rollers that are partially sub- mersed in molten solder.  

A second operation involves application of a coating of solder resist to all areas of  the board surface except the lands that are to be subsequently soldered in assembly. Inspection  After cleaning, the PCB assembly is inspected for defective solder  joints. Inspection of soldering quality is somewhat more difﬁ  cult for surface-mount  circuits (SMCs) because these assemblies are generally more densely packed, the  solder joints are smaller, and joint geometries are different from those in through- hole assemblies. One of the problems is the way surface mount components are held  in place during soldering. In through-hole assembly, the components are mechani- cally fastened in place by clinched leads. In SMT assembly, components are held by  solder paste or adhesive. At soldering temperatures this method of attachment is not  as secure, and components sometimes shift. Another problem with the smaller sizes  in SMT is a greater likelihood of solder bridges forming between adjacent leads,  resulting in short circuits.  

Visual inspection is used to detect for board substrate damage, missing or damaged  components, soldering faults, and similar quality defects that can be observed by eye.  Machine vision systems are being used to perform these inspections automatically in  a growing number of installations.  

Testing  Test procedures must be performed on the completed assembly to verify  its functionality. The board design must allow for this testing by including test points  in the circuit layout. These test points are convenient locations in the circuit where  probes can make contact for testing. Individual components in the circuit are tested  by contacting the component leads, applying input test signals, and measuring the  output signals. More sophisticated procedures include digital function tests, in which  the entire circuit or major subcircuits are tested using a programmed sequence of  input signals and measuring the corresponding output signals to simulate operating  conditions.  

Another test used for printed circuit board assemblies is the substitution test,  in which a production unit is plugged into a mock-up of the working system and  energized to perform its functions. If the assembly performs in a satisfactory way, it  is deemed as passing the test. It is then unplugged, and the next production unit is  substituted in the mock-up.  

Finally, a burn-in test is performed on certain types of PCB assemblies that may  be subject to “infant mortality.” Some boards contain defects that are not revealed in  normal functional tests but which are likely to cause failure of the circuit during early  service. Burn-in tests operate the assemblies under power for a certain period of time,  such as 24 or 72 hours, sometimes at elevated temperatures, such as $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(100^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ , to  force these defects to manifest their failures during the testing period. Boards not  subject to infant mortality will survive this test and provide long service life.  

The smaller scale of SMT poses problems in circuit testing because less space is  available around each component. Contact probes must be physically smaller and  more probes are required because SMT assemblies are more densely populated.  One way of dealing with this issue is to design the circuit layout with extra lands  whose only purpose is to provide a test probe contact site. Unfortunately, including  these test lands runs counter to the goal of achieving higher packing densities on the  SMT board.  

Rework  When inspection and testing indicate that one or more components on  the board are defective, or certain solder joints are faulty, it usually makes sense  to try to repair the assembly rather than discard it together with all of the other  components that are not defective. This repair step is an integral part of electronic  assembly plant operations. Common rework tasks include touchup (repair of solder  faults), replacement of defective or missing components, and repair of copper ﬁ  lm  that has lifted from the substrate surface. These tasks are manual operations, requir- ing skilled workers using soldering irons. Rework of surface-mount assemblies is  more difﬁ  cult than in conventional PIH assemblies, again because of the smaller  component sizes. Special tools are required, such as small-bit soldering irons, magni- fying devices, and instruments for grasping and manipulating the small parts.  

#  Electrical Connector Technology  

PCB assemblies must be connected to back planes, and into racks and cabinets, and  these cabinets must be connected to other cabinets and systems by means of cables.  The growing use of electronics in so many types of products has made electrical  connections an important technology. The performance of any electronic system  depends on the reliability of the individual connections linking the components of  the system together. This section is concerned with connector technology that is  usually applied at the third and higher levels of electronics packaging.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec34.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec34.txt","0.8259871072722929, 0.8249452675660516"
"What are the two main categories of printed circuit board assemblies, as distinguished by the method of attaching components to the board?","Answer. The two categories are: (1) pin-in-hole technology, also known as through-hole technology; and (2) surface mount technology.","The two main categories of printed circuit board assemblies, distinguished by the method of attaching components to the board, are:

1. **Through-Hole Technology (THT):** This method involves inserting component leads through pre-drilled holes in the PCB and soldering them to pads on the opposite side. It provides strong mechanical bonds and is suitable for larger components that require durability and stability.

2. **Surface-Mount Technology (SMT):** In this method, components are mounted directly onto the surface of the PCB without the need for holes. SMT components are generally smaller, allowing for higher circuit densities and more compact board designs. This technology is widely used in mass production due to its efficiency and capability to support miniaturization.

Both methods can be used on the same PCB to leverage the advantages of each technology.","Upper PCB  assembly is through- hole technology  (pin-in-hole) whereas  lower assembly is  mostly surface-mount  technology.

The assembled PCBs are, in turn, connected to a chassis or other framework; this  is the  third level of packaging . This third level may consist of a  rack  that holds the  boards, using wire cables to make the interconnections. In major electronic systems,  such as large computers, the PCBs are typically mounted onto a larger printed cir- cuit board called a  back plane , which has conduction paths to permit interconnec- tion between the smaller boards attached to it. This latter conﬁ  guration is known as  card-on-board  (COB) packaging, in which the smaller PCBs are called cards and  the back plane is the board.  

The  fourth level of packaging  consists of wiring and cabling inside the cabinet  that contains the electronic system. For systems of relatively low complexity, the  packaging may not include all of the possible levels in the hierarchy.  

A printed circuit board consists of one or more thin sheets of insulating material,  with thin copper lines on one or both surfaces that interconnect the components  attached to the board. In boards consisting of more than one layer, copper conduct- ing paths are interleaved between the layers. PCBs are used in packaged electronic  systems to hold components, provide electrical interconnections among them, and  make connections to external circuits. They have become standard building blocks  in virtually all electronic systems that contain packaged ICs and other components  (Historical Note 34.1). PCBs are so important and widely used because (1) they  provide a convenient structural platform for the components; (2) a board with cor- rectly routed interconnections can be mass produced consistently, without the varia- bility usually associated with hand wiring; (3) nearly all of the soldering connections  between components and the PCB can be accomplished in a one-step mechanized  

# Historical Note 34.1  Printed circuit boards  

Before printed circuit boards, electrical and electronic  components were manually fastened to a sheet-metal  chassis (usually aluminum) and then hand wired and  soldered to form the desired circuit. This was called  point-to-point construction. In the late 1950s, various  plastic boards became commercially available. These  boards, which provided electrical insulation, gradually  replaced the aluminum chassis.  The ﬁ  rst plastics were  phenolics, followed by glass-ﬁ  ber-reinforced epoxies.  The boards came with predrilled holes spaced at  standard intervals in both directions. This motivated  the use of electronic components that matched these  hole spacings.  The dual-in-line package evolved during  this period.  

The components in these circuit boards were hand- wired, which proved increasingly difﬁ  cult and prone to  human error as component densities increased and cir- cuits became more complex. The printed circuit board,  with etched copper foil on its surface to form the wiring  interconnections, was developed in the 1950s to solve  these problems with manual wiring. The printed circuit  boards during that period used through-hole technology,  and PCBs had to be drilled to accommodate the com- ponent leads. The original technique for “printing” the  circuit pattern onto the copper-clad board was screen  printing. In the late 1980s, surface mount technology  began to replace through-hole construction. SMT did  not require lead holes, and the components were signi- ﬁ  cantly smaller, allowing much higher circuit densities  to be achieved on the printed circuit boards. As track  widths became ﬁ  ner and ﬁ  ner, photolithography was  substituted for screen printing.  

Initial techniques to design the circuit masks involved  a manual inking procedure, in which the designer at- tempted to route the conducting tracks to provide the  required connections and avoid short circuits on a large  sheet of paper or vellum. This became more difﬁ  cult as  the number of components on the board increased and  the conducting lines interconnecting the components  became ﬁ  ner. Computer programs were developed to  aid the designer in solving the routing problem. How- ever, in many cases, it was impossible to ﬁ  nd a solu- tion with no intersecting tracks (short circuits). To solve  the problem, jumper wires were hand-soldered to the  board to make these connections. # Electronics  Assembly and  Packaging

Integrated circuits constitute the brains of an electronic  system, but the complete system consists of much more  than packaged ICs. The ICs and other components are  mounted and interconnected on printed circuit boards,  which in turn are interconnected and contained in a  chassis or cabinet. Chip packaging (Section 33.6) is  only part of the total electronic package. This chapter  considers the remaining levels of packaging and how  the packages are manufactured and assembled.  

# Electronics  Packaging  

The electronics package is the physical means by which  the components in a system are electrically inter- connected and interfaced to external devices; it includes  the mechanical structure that holds and protects the  circuitry. A well-designed electronics package serves  the following functions: (1) power distribution and sig- nal interconnection, (2) structural support, (3) circuit  protection from physical and chemical hazards in the  environment, (4) dissipation of heat generated by the  circuits, and (5) minimum delays in signal transmission  within the system.  

For complex systems containing many components  and interconnections, the electronics package is organ- ized into levels that comprise a  packaging hierarchy ,  illus  trated in Figure 34.1 and summarized in Table 34.1.  The lowest level is the  zero level , which refers to the  intra connections on the semiconductor chip. The pack- aged chip (chip carrier), consisting of the IC in a plas- tic or ceramic enclosure and connected to the package  leads, constitutes the  ﬁ  rst level of packaging .  

Packaged chips and other components are assembled  to a printed circuit board (PCB) using two technologies  (Section 33.6.1): (1)  surface-mount technology  (SMT)  

![](images/1e20e72922781b4cf2ccd18b84212143ea7a904759ad35c3b86dcb235827b20d.jpg)  

and (2)  through-hole technology , also known as  pin-in-hole  (PIH) technology. Today,  SMT is much more widely used in industry, especially for mass-produced products.  The chip package styles and assembly techniques are different for SMT and PIH. In  many cases, both assembly technologies are employed in the same board. Printed cir- cuit board assembly represents the  second level of packaging . Figure 34.2 shows two  PCB assemblies, illustrating both PIH and SMT types. Note the smaller component  sizes of the SMT board.

What are some of the reasons and defects that make rework an integral step in the PCB fabrication sequence?,"Answer. Rework is required to correct the following types of defects: (1) replace defective components, (2) insert missing components, (3) repair faulty solder joints, and (4) repair of copper film that has lifted from the substrate surface.","Rework is a critical step in the PCB fabrication process, primarily because of the nature of defects that can occur during manufacturing and assembly. Here are some reasons and defects that necessitate rework:

1. **Soldering Defects**: Surface-mount technology (SMT) assemblies pose challenges such as defective solder joints due to the dense packing and smaller joint geometries. Common defects include poor wetting, cold solder joints, and excessive voiding. Additionally, because SMT components are held in place by the adhesive or solder paste before reflow soldering, they may shift, leading to misalignment and necessitating rework.

2. **Solder Bridges**: Due to the smaller size of SMT components, there is an increased risk of forming solder bridges between closely spaced leads, which results in short circuits. Rework is needed to correct these issues to ensure functionality.

3. **Missing or Damaged Components**: During assembly, components may be misplaced, improperly oriented, or damaged, either physically or electrically. Rework allows for the replacement or proper placement of these components to restore the PCB's intended functionality.

4. **Substrate Damage**: The board substrate can incur damage during processing or handling, such as lifted pads or traces. Rework is essential to repair these defects by reinforcing or replacing copper films to restore circuit paths.

5. **Visual and Operational Defects**: Despite automated inspection and testing, certain defects that affect the aesthetics or operation of the PCB may still be present. These could be minor surface imperfections or problems detected during functional testing, requiring manual intervention to address.

6. **Economic Considerations**: The cost of discarding a defective PCB assembly, including all its components, is usually higher than the cost of rework. This economic incentive drives manufacturers to invest in skilled labor and tools for rework.

7. **Complex Testing Requirements**: With the dense packaging of SMT boards, functional testing becomes complicated. Boards that fail digital function tests or other specialized testing may require rework to rectify hidden defects not easily caught during production.

In conclusion, rework remains an integral part of PCB manufacturing because it addresses defects that arise due to the complexity and precision required in modern electronic assemblies. Correcting these defects ensures that high-quality, functional PCB assemblies reach the market, maintaining both economic efficiency and customer satisfaction.","Inspection  After cleaning, the PCB assembly is inspected for defective solder  joints.

PCB assemblies must be connected to back planes, and into racks and cabinets, and  these cabinets must be connected to other cabinets and systems by means of cables.  The growing use of electronics in so many types of products has made electrical  connections an important technology. The performance of any electronic system  depends on the reliability of the individual connections linking the components of  the system together. This section is concerned with connector technology that is  usually applied at the third and higher levels of electronics packaging. These are caused by variations or incorrect  settings in process parameters. Examples include added layers that are too thin  or too thick, insufﬁ  cient diffusion depths in doping, and over- or under-etching. In  general these defects are correctable by improved process control or development  of alter  native processes that are superior. For example, doping by ion implantation  has largely replaced diffusion, and dry plasma etching has been substituted for wet  chemical etching to better control feature dimensions.  

Point defects  occur at very localized areas on the wafer surface, affecting only one  or a limited number of ICs in a particular area. They are commonly caused by dust  particles either on the wafer surface or the lithographic masks. Point defects also  include dislocations in the crystal lattice structure (Section 2.3.2). These point defects  are distributed in some way over the surface of the wafer, resulting in a yield that is  a function of the density of the defects, their distribution over the surface, and the  processed area of the wafer. If the area defects are assumed negligible, and the point  defects are assumed uniform over the surface area of the wafer, the resulting yield  can be modeled by the equation  

$$
Y_{m}={\frac{1}{1+A D}}
$$  

where  $Y_{m}=$  the yield of good chips as determined in multiprobe;  $A\,=$ the area  processed,  $\mathrm{cm}^{2}\ \mathrm{(in}^{2}\mathrm{)}$ ; and  $D\;=\;$ density of point defects, defects $/\mathrm{cm}^{2}$  (defects $/{\mathrm{in}}^{2}]$ ).  This equation is based on  Bose-Einstein  statistics and has been found to be a good  predictor of wafer processing performance, especially for highly integrated chips  (VLSI and beyond).

A silicon wafer with a diameter of $200\:\mathrm{mm}$  is processed over a circular area  whose diameter  $=190\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The chips to be fabricated are square with  $10\,\mathrm{mm}$   on a side. From previous experience, the density of point defects in the surface  area is 0.002 defects $/\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ . Determine an estimate of the number of good chips  using the Bose-Einstein yield computation.  

Solution:  $n_{c}=0.34(190/10)^{2.25}=0.34(19)^{2.25}=256$ chips. Processable wafer area  $A=\pi(190)^{2}/4=28{,}353\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}=283.53\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}.$  

$$
Y_{m}={\frac{1}{1+283.53(0.002)}}={\frac{1}{1+0.567}}=0.638=63.8\%
$$  

Number of good chips $=0.638(256)=163.4$  rounded down to  163 good chips .  

Wafer processing is the key to successful fabrication of integrated circuits. For  an IC producer to be proﬁ  table, high yields must be achieved during this phase of  manufacturing. This is accomplished using the purest possible starting materials, the  latest equipment technologies, good process control over the individual processing  steps, maintenance of clean room conditions, and efﬁ  cient and effective inspection  and testing procedures.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec34.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec33.txt","0.843359601292134, 0.8415623133237737"
Identify some of the advantages of surface mount technology over conventional through-hole technology.,"Answer. Advantages of SMT include: (1) smaller components, (2) higher packing densities, (3) components can be mounted on both sides of the board, (4) smaller PCBs are possible for the same function, (5) reduced number of holes drilled in the board, and (6) certain undesirable electrical effects are reduced, such as spurious surface capacitances and inductances.","Surface mount technology (SMT) offers several advantages over conventional through-hole technology:

1. **Higher Component Density**: SMT allows components to be placed on both sides of the printed circuit board (PCB), effectively doubling the component density. Additionally, SMT components are smaller than their through-hole counterparts, which allows for even greater density and more compact device designs.

2. **Smaller and Lighter Assemblies**: SMT components are generally smaller and lighter, contributing to overall reduced size and weight of electronic devices. This is particularly advantageous in applications where size and weight are critical factors, such as in consumer electronics and aerospace.

3. **Enhanced Performance**: With shorter and more direct pathways, SMT often improves electrical performance due to reduced inductance and capacitance. This can result in faster signal transmission and better overall performance of the electronic assembly.

4. **Automation-Friendly**: SMT is more adaptable to automation compared to through-hole technology. The placement and soldering processes can be more easily mechanized, leading to increased production speeds, improved consistency, and reduced labor costs.

5. **Cost Efficiency**: Although the initial setup costs for SMT equipment can be high, the longer-term production costs are often lower due to improved yield rates, reduced materials consumption, and the potential for higher throughput.

Despite these advantages, SMT is complemented by through-hole technology in certain applications, particularly where mechanical strength or specific component types are required.","# Historical Note 34.2  Surface-mount technology  

Printed circuit board assemblies based on through- hole technology were the predominant electronics  packaging method from the 1950s through most of the  1980s, when surface-mount technology (SMT) started  to be widely used.  

SMT traces its origins to the electronic systems  in the aerospace and military industries of the 1960s,  with the IBM Corporation responsible for much of  the original development work. The ﬁ  rst components  were small, ﬂ  at ceramic packages with gull-wing  leads. The initial reason why these packages were  attrac  tive, compared with through-hole technology,  was the fact that they could be placed on both sides  of a printed circuit board—in effect, doubling the com- ponent density. In addition, the SMT package could be  made smaller than a comparable through-hole pack- age, further increasing component densities on the  printed circuit board.  

In the early 1970s, further advances in SMT were  made in the form of leadless components—components  with ceramic packages that had no discrete leads. This  permitted even greater circuit densities in military and  aerospace electronics. In the late 1970s, plastic SMT  packages became available, motivating the widespread  use of surface-mount technology. The computer and  automotive industries have become important users of  SMT , and their demand for SMT components has con- tributed to the signiﬁ  cant growth in this technology.  

Despite its advantages, SMT has not been fully adopted by the electronics industry to  the exclusion of through-hole technology. There are several reasons for this: (1) Owing  to their smaller size, surface mount components are more difﬁ  cult to handle and assem- ble by humans; (2) inspection, testing, and rework of the circuit assemblies are gener- ally more difﬁ  cult in SMT because of the smaller scale involved; and (3) certain types  of components are not available in surface-mount form. This ﬁ  nal limitation results in  some electronic assemblies that contain both surface-mount and leaded components.  

The sequence of steps to produce assembled PCBs is basically the same in SMT and  through-hole technology: (1) place the components on the PCB, (2) solder the compo- nents to the PCB lands, (3) clean the assembly, (4) inspect, (5) test, and (6) rework. The  details of the ﬁ  rst two steps differ for SMT and through-hole technology. The ﬁ  nal four  steps are the same, except that the smaller scale of SMT makes inspection, testing, and  rework more challenging.  

Component placement in SMT means correctly locating the component on the  PCB and afﬁ  xing it sufﬁ  ciently to the surface until soldering provides permanent  mechanical and electrical connections. Two alternative placement and soldering

methods are available: (1) solder paste and reﬂ  ow soldering, and (2) adhesive bond- ing of components and wave soldering. It turns out that certain types of SMT compo- nents are more suited to one method whereas other types are more suited to the  other method.  

Solder Paste and Reﬂ  ow Soldering   The steps in this method are described in  Figure 34.9. A solder paste is used to afﬁ  x components to the surface of the circuit  board. A  solder paste  is a suspension of solder powders in a ﬂ  ux binder. It has three  functions: (1) it is the solder—typically $80\%$  to $90\%$  of total paste volume, (2) it is  the ﬂ  ux, and (3) it is the adhesive that temporarily secures the components to the  surface of the board. Methods of applying the solder paste to the board surface  include screen printing and syringe dispensing. Upper PCB  assembly is through- hole technology  (pin-in-hole) whereas  lower assembly is  mostly surface-mount  technology. (Courtesy  of George E. Kane  Manufacturing  Technology Laboratory,  Lehigh University.)  

The assembled PCBs are, in turn, connected to a chassis or other framework; this  is the  third level of packaging . This third level may consist of a  rack  that holds the  boards, using wire cables to make the interconnections. In major electronic systems,  such as large computers, the PCBs are typically mounted onto a larger printed cir- cuit board called a  back plane , which has conduction paths to permit interconnec- tion between the smaller boards attached to it. This latter conﬁ  guration is known as  card-on-board  (COB) packaging, in which the smaller PCBs are called cards and  the back plane is the board.  

The  fourth level of packaging  consists of wiring and cabling inside the cabinet  that contains the electronic system. For systems of relatively low complexity, the  packaging may not include all of the possible levels in the hierarchy.  

A printed circuit board consists of one or more thin sheets of insulating material,  with thin copper lines on one or both surfaces that interconnect the components  attached to the board. In boards consisting of more than one layer, copper conduct- ing paths are interleaved between the layers. PCBs are used in packaged electronic  systems to hold components, provide electrical interconnections among them, and  make connections to external circuits. They have become standard building blocks  in virtually all electronic systems that contain packaged ICs and other components  (Historical Note 34.1). PCBs are so important and widely used because (1) they  provide a convenient structural platform for the components; (2) a board with cor- rectly routed interconnections can be mass produced consistently, without the varia- bility usually associated with hand wiring; (3) nearly all of the soldering connections  between components and the PCB can be accomplished in a one-step mechanized  

# Historical Note 34.1  Printed circuit boards  

Before printed circuit boards, electrical and electronic  components were manually fastened to a sheet-metal  chassis (usually aluminum) and then hand wired and  soldered to form the desired circuit. This was called  point-to-point construction. In the late 1950s, various  plastic boards became commercially available. These  boards, which provided electrical insulation, gradually  replaced the aluminum chassis.  The ﬁ  rst plastics were  phenolics, followed by glass-ﬁ  ber-reinforced epoxies.  The boards came with predrilled holes spaced at  standard intervals in both directions. This motivated  the use of electronic components that matched these  hole spacings.  The dual-in-line package evolved during  this period.  

The components in these circuit boards were hand- wired, which proved increasingly difﬁ  cult and prone to  human error as component densities increased and cir- cuits became more complex. The printed circuit board,  with etched copper foil on its surface to form the wiring  interconnections, was developed in the 1950s to solve  these problems with manual wiring. The printed circuit  boards during that period used through-hole technology,  and PCBs had to be drilled to accommodate the com- ponent leads. The original technique for “printing” the  circuit pattern onto the copper-clad board was screen  printing. In the late 1980s, surface mount technology  began to replace through-hole construction. SMT did  not require lead holes, and the components were signi- ﬁ  cantly smaller, allowing much higher circuit densities  to be achieved on the printed circuit boards. As track  widths became ﬁ  ner and ﬁ  ner, photolithography was  substituted for screen printing.  

Initial techniques to design the circuit masks involved  a manual inking procedure, in which the designer at- tempted to route the conducting tracks to provide the  required connections and avoid short circuits on a large  sheet of paper or vellum. This became more difﬁ  cult as  the number of components on the board increased and  the conducting lines interconnecting the components  became ﬁ  ner. Computer programs were developed to  aid the designer in solving the routing problem. How- ever, in many cases, it was impossible to ﬁ  nd a solu- tion with no intersecting tracks (short circuits). To solve  the problem, jumper wires were hand-soldered to the  board to make these connections.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec34.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec34.txt","0.8645649710322307, 0.8532426399006987"

Limitations and disadvantages of SMT include: (1) components are more difficult for humans to handle, (2) SMT components are generally more expensive than THT components, (3) inspection, testing, and rework are more difficult, and (4) certain types of components are not available in SMT.","Surface mount technology (SMT) has several limitations and disadvantages despite its widespread use:

1. **Handling and Assembly Challenges**: 
   - SMT components are smaller than through-hole components, making them more difficult to handle and assemble manually. This requires specialized equipment like pick-and-place machines, which can increase production costs.

2. **Inspection, Testing, and Rework Difficulties**:
   - Due to their small size and dense packing, inspecting SMT assemblies can be challenging. Automated optical inspection (AOI) and X-ray inspection systems are often necessary, adding to the complexity and cost.
   - Testing the assemblies is more difficult because traditional testing methods may not address the intricacies of SMT.
   - Rework (repair of faulty assemblies) can be complicated by the small size and high density of SMT components, potentially leading to higher rates of damage during rework.

3. **Component Availability**:
   - Not all electronic components are available in surface-mount form. Some components still require through-hole mounting, leading to hybrid assemblies that combine both technologies and complicate the manufacturing process.

4. **Initial Setup Cost**:
   - The initial setup for SMT can be more expensive than through-hole technology due to the need for specialized equipment for solder paste application, reflow soldering, and inspection.

5. **Thermal and Mechanical Stress**:
   - Due to the lack of lead support found in through-hole components, SMT components can be more susceptible to damage from thermal and mechanical stress.

These limitations must be weighed against the benefits of higher component density and smaller PCB size when choosing SMT for electronic assembly.","# Historical Note 34.2  Surface-mount technology

The setup consists of an array  of probes that are forced under light pressure to make contact with speciﬁ  ed points  on the board surface. Electrical connections between contact points can be quickly  checked in this procedure.  

Several additional processing steps must be performed on the bare board to pre- pare it for assembly. The ﬁ  rst of these ﬁ  nishing operations is the application of a thin  solder layer on the track and land surfaces. This layer serves to protect the copper  from oxidation and contamination. It is carried out either by electroplating or by  bringing the copper side into contact with rotating rollers that are partially sub- mersed in molten solder.  

A second operation involves application of a coating of solder resist to all areas of  the board surface except the lands that are to be subsequently soldered in assembly.  The solder resist coating is chemically formulated to resist adhesion of solder; thus,  in the subsequent soldering processes, solder adheres only to land areas. Solder resist  is usually applied by screen printing.  

Finally, an identiﬁ  cation legend is printed onto the surface, again by screen print- ing. The legend indicates where the different components are to be placed on the  board in ﬁ  nal assembly. In modern industrial practice, a bar code is also printed on  the board for production control purposes.  

#  Printed Circuit Board Assembly  

A printed circuit board assembly consists of electronic components (e.g., IC pack- ages, resistors, capacitors) as well as mechanical components (e.g., fasteners, heat  sinks) mounted on a printed circuit board. This is level 2 in electronic packaging  (Table 34.1). As indicated, PCB assembly is based on either surface-mount techno- logy (SMT) or through-hole technology (see Figure 34.2). Some PCB assemblies  include both SMT and through-hole components. The discussion in this section  covers both categories as well as combinations of the two. The scope of electronic  assembly also includes higher packaging levels such as assemblies of multiple  PCBs electrically connected and mechanically contained in a chassis or cabinet.  Section 34.4 explores the technologies by which electrical connections are made at  these higher levels.  

# 34.3.1  SURFACE MOUNT TECHNOLOGY  

Since the late 1980s, the use of surface mount technology has grown to the point  where it is now the dominant process in printed circuit board assembly. The earlier  through-hole technology has the following inherent limitations in terms of packing  density: (1) components can be mounted on only one side of the board, and (2) center- to-center distance between lead pins in leaded components must be a minimum of  $1.0\:\mathrm{mm}\:(0.04\:\mathrm{in})$  and is usually $2.5\,\mathrm{mm}\,(0.10\,\mathrm{in})$ .  

Surface-mount technology uses an assembly method in which component leads  are soldered to lands on the surface of the board rather than into holes running  through the board (Historical Note 34.2). By eliminating the need for leads inserted  into through holes in the board, several advantages are gained: (1) smaller compo- nents are available, with leads closer together; (2) circuit densities can be increased;  (3) components can be mounted on both sides of the board; (4) smaller PCBs can be  used for the same electronic system; and (5) drilling of the many through holes dur- ing board fabrication is eliminated although via holes to interconnect layers are still  required [6]. Typical areas on the board surface taken by SMT components range  between $20\%$  and $60\%$  compared to through-hole components.

What are the two methods of component placement and soldering in surface mount technology?,"Answer. The two methods are: (1) adhesive bonding and wave soldering, and (2) solder paste and reflow soldering.","The two methods of component placement and soldering in surface mount technology (SMT) are:

1. **Solder Paste and Reflow Soldering**: This method involves applying solder paste to the desired land areas on the PCB. Components are then placed onto the board, and the paste is baked to adhere the components temporarily. The assembly undergoes a reflow process where the solder paste is heated to form permanent mechanical and electrical connections.

2. **Adhesive Bonding and Wave Soldering**: In this method, components are initially bonded to the PCB surface using an adhesive. The board is then subjected to wave soldering, where a wave of molten solder is applied to form the solder joints. This method is more suitable for certain types of SMT components.

Each method has its suitability based on component type and assembly requirements.","# Historical Note 34.2  Surface-mount technology

What is a solder paste?,Answer. A solder paste is a suspension of solder powders in a flux binder. The flux binder includes an adhesive that attaches the SMT components to the board surface. The solder constitutes about 85% of the total volume of the paste.,"A solder paste is a mixture used in the surface mount technology (SMT) assembly process for printed circuit boards (PCBs). It is a suspension of solder powder particles in a flux binder. The solder paste serves three primary functions:

1. **Solder**: It constitutes 80% to 90% of the total paste volume, providing the metallic material necessary to form solder joints between components and the board.

2. **Flux**: The paste contains a flux that aids in removing oxides from the surfaces to be joined, ensuring a clean area for the solder to bond effectively.

3. **Adhesive**: Initially, the paste acts as an adhesive to temporarily secure components in place on the board surface until the reflow process melts the solder and creates permanent bonds.

The paste is applied to the board using methods like screen printing or syringe dispensing, and must have properties that allow it to flow without spreading outside the desired areas.","It turns out that certain types of SMT compo- nents are more suited to one method whereas other types are more suited to the  other method.  

Solder Paste and Reﬂ  ow Soldering   The steps in this method are described in  Figure 34.9. A solder paste is used to afﬁ  x components to the surface of the circuit  board. A  solder paste  is a suspension of solder powders in a ﬂ  ux binder. It has three  functions: (1) it is the solder—typically $80\%$  to $90\%$  of total paste volume, (2) it is  the ﬂ  ux, and (3) it is the adhesive that temporarily secures the components to the  surface of the board. Methods of applying the solder paste to the board surface  include screen printing and syringe dispensing. Properties of the paste must be com- patible with these application methods; the paste must ﬂ  ow yet not be so liquid that  it spreads beyond the localized area where it is applied.  

After solder paste application, the components are placed onto the board surface  by automated placement machines or semiautomatic placement machines. The auto- matic machines operate under computer numerical control (Section 37.3). Compo- nents (e.g., chip carriers, capacitors, resistors) to be placed are usually supplied in  magazines or attached to tape in reels that can be loaded into feeders on the auto- mated machines. The starting blank PCB is moved and positioned under the pick- and-place work head that places the components at speciﬁ  ed locations on the board  using a high-speed  $x$ - y  positioning system. The work head uses suction nozzles to  retrieve and handle components. Automated machines operate at cycle rates of up  to 30,000 components per hour [20]. For mass production, they are frequently inte- grated into production lines, so that most or all of the processes performed on the  board during assembly are completed in one automated sequence.  

The semiautomatic machines assist a worker in the placement operation using a  high-resolution vision system. Components to be placed are presented to the opera- tor in the correct placement sequence by a turret mechanism, and then the operator  picks the component and is guided by the vision monitor to place it at the target

location on the board. Cycle rates of 1,000 components per hour are claimed for  some semiautomatic machines [15].  

After all components are placed on the board, a low-temperature baking opera- tion is performed to dry the ﬂ  ux binder; this reduces gas escape during soldering.  Finally, the solder reﬂ  ow process (Section 30.2.3) heats the solder paste sufﬁ  ciently  that the solder particles melt to form a high-quality mechanical and electrical joint  between the component leads and the circuit lands on the board.  

Adhesive Bonding and Wave Soldering  The sequence of steps is depicted in  Figure 34.10. Various adhesives (Section 30.3) are used for afﬁ  xing components to  the board surface. Most common are epoxies and acrylics. The adhesive is applied by  one of three methods: (1) brushing liquid adhesive through a screen stencil; (2) using  an automatic dispensing machine with a programmable  $x$ - y  positioning system; or  (3) using a pin transfer method, in which a ﬁ  xture consisting of pins arranged accord- ing to where adhesive must be applied is dipped into the liquid adhesive and then  positioned onto the board surface to deposit adhesive in the required spots.  

Components are placed on the board by the same type of placement machines used  with the solder paste assembly method. After component placement, the adhesive  is cured. # Historical Note 34.2  Surface-mount technology  

Printed circuit board assemblies based on through- hole technology were the predominant electronics  packaging method from the 1950s through most of the  1980s, when surface-mount technology (SMT) started  to be widely used.  

SMT traces its origins to the electronic systems  in the aerospace and military industries of the 1960s,  with the IBM Corporation responsible for much of  the original development work. The ﬁ  rst components  were small, ﬂ  at ceramic packages with gull-wing  leads. The initial reason why these packages were  attrac  tive, compared with through-hole technology,  was the fact that they could be placed on both sides  of a printed circuit board—in effect, doubling the com- ponent density. In addition, the SMT package could be  made smaller than a comparable through-hole pack- age, further increasing component densities on the  printed circuit board.  

In the early 1970s, further advances in SMT were  made in the form of leadless components—components  with ceramic packages that had no discrete leads. This  permitted even greater circuit densities in military and  aerospace electronics. In the late 1970s, plastic SMT  packages became available, motivating the widespread  use of surface-mount technology. The computer and  automotive industries have become important users of  SMT , and their demand for SMT components has con- tributed to the signiﬁ  cant growth in this technology.  

Despite its advantages, SMT has not been fully adopted by the electronics industry to  the exclusion of through-hole technology. There are several reasons for this: (1) Owing  to their smaller size, surface mount components are more difﬁ  cult to handle and assem- ble by humans; (2) inspection, testing, and rework of the circuit assemblies are gener- ally more difﬁ  cult in SMT because of the smaller scale involved; and (3) certain types  of components are not available in surface-mount form. This ﬁ  nal limitation results in  some electronic assemblies that contain both surface-mount and leaded components.  

The sequence of steps to produce assembled PCBs is basically the same in SMT and  through-hole technology: (1) place the components on the PCB, (2) solder the compo- nents to the PCB lands, (3) clean the assembly, (4) inspect, (5) test, and (6) rework. The  details of the ﬁ  rst two steps differ for SMT and through-hole technology. The ﬁ  nal four  steps are the same, except that the smaller scale of SMT makes inspection, testing, and  rework more challenging.  

Component placement in SMT means correctly locating the component on the  PCB and afﬁ  xing it sufﬁ  ciently to the surface until soldering provides permanent  mechanical and electrical connections. Two alternative placement and soldering

Identify the two basic methods of making electrical connections.,"Answer. The two methods are: (1) soldering, and (2) pressure connections.","The two basic methods of making electrical connections are:

1. **Soldering**: This method involves using a soldering iron to melt solder, creating a bond between metal surfaces, ensuring electrical continuity. It is the most widely used method in electronics for its reliability in creating permanent connections.

2. **Pressure Connections**: These are created using mechanical forces to establish electrical contact between components. Pressure connections can be further divided into:
   - **Permanent Connections**: Involves high-pressure contact, often deforming one or both metal surfaces for a lasting connection, using methods like crimping or press fit technology.
   - **Separable Connections**: These allow for components to be connected and disconnected without deformation or damage, providing flexibility in electronic systems.","These tasks are manual operations, requir- ing skilled workers using soldering irons. Rework of surface-mount assemblies is  more difﬁ  cult than in conventional PIH assemblies, again because of the smaller  component sizes. Special tools are required, such as small-bit soldering irons, magni- fying devices, and instruments for grasping and manipulating the small parts.  

#  Electrical Connector Technology  

PCB assemblies must be connected to back planes, and into racks and cabinets, and  these cabinets must be connected to other cabinets and systems by means of cables.  The growing use of electronics in so many types of products has made electrical  connections an important technology. The performance of any electronic system  depends on the reliability of the individual connections linking the components of  the system together. This section is concerned with connector technology that is  usually applied at the third and higher levels of electronics packaging.  

To begin, there are two basic methods of making electrical connections: (1) solder- ing and (2) pressure connections. Soldering was discussed in Section 30.2 and through- out the current chapter. It is the most widely used technology in electronics.  Pressure  connections  are electrical connections in which mechanical forces are used to estab- lish electrical continuity between components. They can be divided into two types:  permanent and separable.  

# 34.4.1  PERMANENT CONNECTIONS  

A permanent connection involves high-pressure contact between two metal sur- faces, in which one or both parts are mechanically deformed during the assembly  process. Permanent connection methods include crimping, press ﬁ  t technology, and  insulation displacement.  

Crimping of Connector Terminals  This connection method is used to assemble  wire to electrical terminals. Although assembly of the wire to the terminal forms a  permanent joint, the terminal itself is designed to be connected and disconnected  to its mating component. There are a variety of terminal styles, some of which are  shown in Figure 34.14, and they are available in various sizes. They all must be con- nected to conductor wire, and crimping is the operation for doing this.  Crimping involves the mechanical deformation of the terminal barrel to form a permanent  connection with the stripped end of a wire inserted into it. The crimping operation  squeezes and closes the barrel around the bare wire. Crimping is performed by hand  tools or crimping machines. The terminals are supplied either as individual pieces or  on long strips that can be fed into a crimping machine. Properly accomplished, the  crimped joint will have low electrical resistance and high mechanical strength.

FIGURE 34.15  Two types of  terminal pins in electronics  press ﬁ  t technology: (a) solid  and (b) compliant.  

Press Fit Technology  Press ﬁ  t in electrical connections is similar to that in mechani- cal assembly, but the part conﬁ  gurations are different. Press ﬁ  t technology is widely  used in the electronics industry to assemble terminal pins into metal-plated through- holes in large PCBs. In that context, a  press ﬁ  t  involves an interference ﬁ  t between  the terminal pin and the plated hole into which it has been inserted. There are two  categories of terminal pins: (a) solid and (b) compliant, as in Figure 34.15. Within these  categories, pin designs vary among suppliers. The solid pin is rectangular in cross sec- tion and is designed so that its corners press and even cut into the metal of the plated  hole to form a good electrical connection. The compliant pin is designed as a spring- loaded device that conforms to the hole contour but presses against the walls of the  hole to achieve electrical contact. Some  of the principal connector types are cable connectors, terminal blocks, sockets, and  connectors with low or zero insertion force.  

Cable connectors  are devices that are permanently connected to cables (one or  both ends) and are designed to be plugged into and unplugged from a mating con- nector. A power cord connector that plugs into a wall receptacle is a familiar example.  Other styles include the type of multiple pin connector and mating receptacle shown  in Figure 34.17, used to provide signal transmission between electronic subassem- blies. Other multiple pin connector styles are used to attach printed circuit boards to  other subassemblies in the electronic system.  

Terminal blocks  consist of a series of evenly spaced receptacles that allow connec- tions between individual terminals or wires. The terminals or wires are often attached  to the block by means of screws or other mechanical fastening mechanisms to permit  disassembly. A conventional terminal block is illustrated in Figure 34.18.  

A  socket  in electronics refers to a connection device mounted to a PCB, into  which IC packages and other components can be inserted. Sockets are permanently  attached to the PCB by soldering and/or press ﬁ  tting, but they provide a separable  connection method for the components, which can be conveniently added, removed,  or replaced in the PCB assembly. Sockets are therefore an alternative to soldering  in electronics packaging.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec34.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec34.txt","0.843948360123981, 0.8386662512343888"

Insulation Displacement   Insulation displacement is a method of making a perma- nent electrical connection in which a sharp, prong-shaped contact pierces the insulation  and squeezes against the wire conductor to form an electrical connection. The method  is illustrated in Figure 34.16 and is commonly used to make simultaneous connections  between multiple contacts and ﬂ  at cable. The ﬂ  at cable, called  ribbon cable , consists of  a number of parallel wires held in a ﬁ  xed arrangement by the insula  tion surrounding  them. It is often terminated in multiple pin connectors that are widely used in elec- tronics to make electrical connections between major subassemblies. In these applica- tions, the insulation displacement method reduces wiring errors and speeds harness  assembly. To make the assembly, the cable is placed in a nest and a press is used to drive  the connector contacts through the insulation and against the metal wires.

# 34.4.2  SEPARABLE CONNECTORS  

Separable connections are designed to permit disassembly and reassembly; they are  meant to be connected and disconnected multiple times. When connected they must  provide metal-to-metal contact between mating components with high reliability and  low electrical resistance. Separable connection devices typically consist of multiple  contacts, contained in a plastic molded housing, designed to mate with a compatible  connector or individual wires or terminals. They are used for making electrical connec- tions between various combinations of cables, printed circuit boards, components, and  individual wires.  

A wide selection of connectors is available to serve many different applications.  The design issues in choosing among them include (1) power level (e.g., whether the  connector is used for power or signal transmission); (2) cost; (3) number of individual  conductors involved; (4) types of devices and circuits to be connected; (5) space limita- tions; (6) ease of joining the connector to its leads; (7) ease of connecting with the mat- ing terminal or connector; and (8) frequency of connection and disconnection. Some  of the principal connector types are cable connectors, terminal blocks, sockets, and  connectors with low or zero insertion force.  

Cable connectors  are devices that are permanently connected to cables (one or  both ends) and are designed to be plugged into and unplugged from a mating con- nector.

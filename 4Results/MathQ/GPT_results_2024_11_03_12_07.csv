" A tensile test uses a test specimen that has a gage length of 50 mm and an area = 200 mm2. During the test the specimen yields under a load of 98,000 N. The corresponding gage length = 50.23 mm. 
This is the 0.2 percent yield point. The maximum load of 168,000 N is reached at a gage length = 
64.2 mm. D. Determine (a) yield strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, and (c) tensile strength. ","Solution: (a) Y = 98,000/200 = 490 MPa. (b) s = E e Subtracting the 0.2% offset, e = (50.23 -50.0)/50.0 -0.002 = 0.0026 E = s/e = 490/0.0026 = 188.5 x 103 MPa.  (c) TS = 168,000/200 = 840 MPa.  ","To solve the problem, we need to calculate the yield strength, modulus of elasticity, and tensile strength using the given values.

### (a) Yield Strength

The yield strength is the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically. It is calculated using the load at the yield point and the original cross-sectional area.

\[
\text{Yield Strength} = \frac{\text{Yield Load}}{\text{Original Area}}
\]

Given:
- Yield Load = 98,000 N
- Original Area = 200 mm\(^2\)

\[
\text{Yield Strength} = \frac{98,000 \, \text{N}}{200 \, \text{mm}^2} = 490 \, \text{N/mm}^2
\]

### (b) Modulus of Elasticity

The modulus of elasticity (also known as Young's modulus) is a measure of the material's stiffness, calculated from the initial, linear portion of the stress-strain curve. It is the ratio of stress to strain at the elastic limit.

First, calculate the stress and strain at the yield point:
- Original gage length = 50 mm
- Gage length at yield = 50.23 mm
- Change in length (\(\Delta L\)) = 50.23 mm - 50 mm = 0.23 mm

Strain (\(\varepsilon\)) is the change in length divided by the original length:
\[
\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{\text{Original length}} = \frac{0.23 \, \text{mm}}{50 \, \text{mm}} = 0.0046
\]

Stress (\(\sigma\)) is the yield strength:
\[
\sigma = \frac{98,000 \, \text{N}}{200 \, \text{mm}^2} = 490 \, \text{N/mm}^2
\]

Modulus of Elasticity (\(E\)) is:
\[
E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon} = \frac{490 \, \text{N/mm}^2}{0.0046} \approx 106,522 \, \text{N/mm}^2
\]

### (c) Tensile Strength

Tensile strength is the maximum stress a material can withstand while being stretched before failure. It's calculated using the maximum load.

\[
\text{Tensile Strength} = \frac{\text{Maximum Load}}{\text{Original Area}}
\]

Given:
- Maximum Load = 168,000 N

\[
\text{Tensile Strength} = \frac{168,000 \, \text{N}}{200 \, \text{mm}^2} = 840 \, \text{N/mm}^2
\]

### Summary

- Yield Strength: 490 N/mm²
- Modulus of Elasticity: 106,522 N/mm²
- Tensile Strength: 840 N/mm²",3.0,3.01
"A test specimen in a tensile test has a gage length of 2.0 in and an area = 0.5 in2. During the test the specimen yields under a load of 32,000 lb. The corresponding gage length = 2.0083 in. This is the 0.2 percent yield point. The maximum load of 60,000 lb is reached at a gage length = 2.60 in. Determine (a) yield strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, and (c) tensile strength. (d) If fracture occurs at a gage length of 2.92 in, determine the percent elongation. (e) If the specimen necked to an area = 0.25 in2, determine the percent reduction in area.","Solution: (a) Y = 32,000/0.5 = 64,000 lb/in2 (b) s = E e Subtracting the 0.2% offset, e = (2.0083 -2.0)/2.0 -0.002 = 0.00215 E = s/e = 64,000/0.00215 = 29.77 x 106 lb/in2  (c) TS = 60,000/0.5 = 120,000 lb/in2  (d) EL = (2.92 -2.0)/2.0 = 0.92/2.0 = 0.46 = 46%  (e) AR = (0.5 -0.25)/0.5 = 0.50 = 50%","To solve this problem, we'll use the given data to determine the requested mechanical properties.

(a) **Yield Strength**

The yield strength is the stress at which the material begins to deform plastically. Yield strength is calculated using the formula:

\[ \sigma_y = \frac{P_y}{A} \]

where \( P_y = 32,000 \, \text{lb} \) is the yield load, and \( A = 0.5 \, \text{in}^2 \) is the original cross-sectional area.

\[ \sigma_y = \frac{32,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} = 64,000 \, \text{psi} \]

(b) **Modulus of Elasticity**

The modulus of elasticity \( E \) is determined from the stress-strain relationship in the elastic region. Using the 0.2% offset yield point data, the strain \( \varepsilon \) is calculated as:

\[ \varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0} = \frac{2.0083 \, \text{in} - 2.0 \, \text{in}}{2.0 \, \text{in}} = 0.00415 \]

The modulus of elasticity is then given by:

\[ E = \frac{\sigma_y}{\varepsilon} = \frac{64,000 \, \text{psi}}{0.00415} \approx 15,422,891 \, \text{psi} \]

(c) **Tensile Strength**

Tensile strength is the maximum load divided by the original cross-sectional area, calculated as:

\[ \sigma_{\text{max}} = \frac{P_{\text{max}}}{A} \]

where \( P_{\text{max}} = 60,000 \, \text{lb} \).

\[ \sigma_{\text{max}} = \frac{60,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} = 120,000 \, \text{psi} \]

(d) **Percent Elongation**

Percent elongation is calculated using the change in gage length at fracture:

\[ \text{Percent elongation} = \left(\frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0}\right) \times 100\% \]

where \( L_f = 2.92 \, \text{in} \).

\[ \text{Percent elongation} = \left(\frac{2.92 \, \text{in} - 2.0 \, \text{in}}{2.0 \, \text{in}}\right) \times 100\% = 46\% \]

(e) **Percent Reduction in Area**

Percent reduction in area is calculated using the change in area at fracture:

\[ \text{Percent reduction in area} = \left(\frac{A_0 - A_f}{A_0}\right) \times 100\% \]

where \( A_f = 0.25 \, \text{in}^2 \).

\[ \text{Percent reduction in area} = \left(\frac{0.5 \, \text{in}^2 - 0.25 \, \text{in}^2}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2}\right) \times 100\% = 50\% \]

In summary:
- Yield Strength: \( 64,000 \, \text{psi} \)
- Modulus of Elasticity: \( \approx 15,422,891 \, \text{psi} \)
- Tensile Strength: \( 120,000 \, \text{psi} \)
- Percent Elongation: \( 46\% \)
- Percent Reduction in Area: \( 50\% \)",3.0,3.02
"During a tensile test in which the starting gage length = 125.0 mm and the cross-sectional area = 62.5 mm2, the following force and gage length data are collected (1) 17,793 N at 125.23 mm, (2) 23,042 N at 131.25 mm, (3) 27,579 N at 140.05 mm, (4) 28, 913 N at 147.01 mm, (5) 27,578 N at 153.00 mm, and (6) 20,462 N at 160.10 mm.

(d) From the plot, TS = 462.6 MPa. Also, TS = 28,913/62.5 = 462.6 MPa.","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the engineering stress and engineering strain for each data point, plot the stress-strain curve, and then determine the yield strength, modulus of elasticity, and tensile strength.

### (a) Plot the Engineering Stress-Strain Curve:

1. **Calculate Engineering Stress:**
   The engineering stress (\(\sigma\)) is calculated as:
   \[
   \sigma = \frac{F}{A_0}
   \]
   where \(F\) is the force and \(A_0 = 62.5 \, \text{mm}^2\) is the original cross-sectional area.

2. **Calculate Engineering Strain:**
   The engineering strain (\(\varepsilon\)) is calculated as:
   \[
   \varepsilon = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0}
   \]
   where \(L\) is the gage length and \(L_0 = 125.0 \, \text{mm}\) is the original gage length.

#### Calculations for Each Data Point:
- **Point 1:** 
  - Force (F) = 17,793 N, Gage Length (L) = 125.23 mm
  - Stress \(\sigma_1 = \frac{17,793}{62.5} = 284.69 \, \text{MPa}\)
  - Strain \(\varepsilon_1 = \frac{125.23 - 125}{125} = 0.00184\)

- **Point 2:**
  - Force (F) = 23,042 N, Gage Length (L) = 131.25 mm
  - Stress \(\sigma_2 = \frac{23,042}{62.5} = 368.67 \, \text{MPa}\)
  - Strain \(\varepsilon_2 = \frac{131.25 - 125}{125} = 0.050\)

- **Point 3:**
  - Force (F) = 27,579 N, Gage Length (L) = 140.05 mm
  - Stress \(\sigma_3 = \frac{27,579}{62.5} = 441.26 \, \text{MPa}\)
  - Strain \(\varepsilon_3 = \frac{140.05 - 125}{125} = 0.1204\)

- **Point 4:**
  - Force (F) = 28,913 N, Gage Length (L) = 147.01 mm
  - Stress \(\sigma_4 = \frac{28,913}{62.5} = 462.61 \, \text{MPa}\)
  - Strain \(\varepsilon_4 = \frac{147.01 - 125}{125} = 0.17608\)

- **Point 5:**
  - Force (F) = 27,578 N, Gage Length (L) = 153.00 mm
  - Stress \(\sigma_5 = \frac{27,578}{62.5} = 441.25 \, \text{MPa}\)
  - Strain \(\varepsilon_5 = \frac{153.00 - 125}{125} = 0.2240\)

- **Point 6:**
  - Force (F) = 20,462 N, Gage Length (L) = 160.10 mm
  - Stress \(\sigma_6 = \frac{20,462}{62.5} = 327.39 \, \text{MPa}\)
  - Strain \(\varepsilon_6 = \frac{160.10 - 125}{125} = 0.2808\)

Now, plot these stress-strain points on a graph to create the engineering stress-strain curve.

### (b) Determine Yield Strength:
The yield strength is generally calculated at the 0.2% offset strain. In this data, a precise value can't be calculated directly, but you approximate it using the linear portion of the initial stress-strain curve.

### (c) Determine Modulus of Elasticity (E):
The modulus of elasticity is the slope of the initial linear portion of the stress-strain curve. You can approximate this using the first two points:
\[
E \approx \frac{\sigma_2 - \sigma_1}{\varepsilon_2 - \varepsilon_1} = \frac{368.67 - 284.69}{0.050 - 0.00184} = 1,720 \, \text{MPa}
\]

### (d) Determine Tensile Strength:
The tensile strength is the maximum stress on the stress-strain curve, which occurs at the maximum load.
\[
\sigma_t = \frac{28,913}{62.5} = 462.61 \, \text{MPa}
\]

These calculations and approximations should allow you to answer the questions about yield strength, modulus of elasticity, and tensile strength based on the stress-strain data provided.",3.0,3.03
A tensile test for a certain metal provides flow curve parameters: strain-hardening exponent is 0.3 and strength coefficient is 600 MPa. Determine (a) the flow stress at a true strain = 1.0 and (b) true strain at a flow stress = 600 MPa.,Solution: (a) Yf = 600(1.0)^.3 = 600 MPa (b) H = (600/600)^(1/.3) = (1.0)^3.33 = 1.00,"To determine the flow stress and true strain for the given metal, we'll use the formula for the flow curve, which is given by the equation:

\[
\sigma = K \cdot \varepsilon^n
\]

where:
- \(\sigma\) is the flow stress,
- \(K\) is the strength coefficient,
- \(\varepsilon\) is the true strain,
- \(n\) is the strain-hardening exponent.

Given:
- \(K = 600 \, \text{MPa}\),
- \(n = 0.3\).

**(a) Calculate the flow stress at a true strain of 1.0:**

Plug \(\varepsilon = 1.0\) into the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = 600 \cdot (1.0)^{0.3}
\]

Since \(1.0^{0.3} = 1\), we have:

\[
\sigma = 600 \, \text{MPa}
\]

So, the flow stress at a true strain of 1.0 is \(600 \, \text{MPa}\).

**(b) Determine the true strain when the flow stress is \(600 \, \text{MPa}\):**

Set \(\sigma = 600 \, \text{MPa}\) and solve for \(\varepsilon\):

\[
600 = 600 \cdot \varepsilon^{0.3}
\]

Divide both sides by 600:

\[
1 = \varepsilon^{0.3}
\]

Raise both sides to the power of \(\frac{1}{0.3}\) (or approximately 3.333):

\[
\varepsilon = 1^{3.333} = 1
\]

Thus, the true strain when the flow stress is \(600 \, \text{MPa}\) is \(\varepsilon = 1.0\).

In summary:
(a) The flow stress at a true strain of 1.0 is \(600 \, \text{MPa}\).
(b) The true strain at a flow stress of \(600 \, \text{MPa}\) is \(1.0\).",3.0,3.08
"The flow curve for a certain metal has a strain-hardening exponent of 0.22 and strength coefficient of 54,000 lb/in2.

\[
\sigma = K \epsilon^n
\]

where:
- \( \sigma \) is the flow stress,
- \( \epsilon \) is the true strain,
- \( K \) is the strength coefficient, which is given as 54,000 lb/in²,
- \( n \) is the strain-hardening exponent, which is given as 0.22.

### (a) Calculate the flow stress at a true strain (\(\epsilon\)) of 0.45:

Given:
- \( \epsilon = 0.45 \)
- \( K = 54,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \)
- \( n = 0.22 \)

We can substitute these values into the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = 54,000 \times (0.45)^{0.22}
\]

First, calculate \( (0.45)^{0.22} \):

\[
(0.45)^{0.22} \approx 0.7631
\]

Now calculate the flow stress:

\[
\sigma = 54,000 \times 0.7631 \approx 41,217.4 \, \text{lb/in}^2
\]

So, the flow stress at a true strain of 0.45 is approximately 41,217.4 lb/in².

### (b) Determine the true strain at a flow stress (\(\sigma\)) of 40,000 lb/in²:

Given:
- \( \sigma = 40,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \)

We need to find \( \epsilon \) using the flow curve equation:

\[
40,000 = 54,000 \times \epsilon^{0.22}
\]

Rearrange the equation to solve for \( \epsilon \):

\[
\epsilon^{0.22} = \frac{40,000}{54,000}
\]

Calculate the ratio:

\[
\epsilon^{0.22} = 0.7407
\]

Now, solve for \( \epsilon \):

\[
\epsilon = (0.7407)^{\frac{1}{0.22}}
\]

Calculate \( (0.7407)^{\frac{1}{0.22}} \):

\[
\epsilon \approx 0.403
\]

So, the true strain at a flow stress of 40,000 lb/in² is approximately 0.403.",3.0,3.09
"A tensile specimen is elongated to twice its original length. Determine the engineering strain and true strain for this test. If the metal had been strained in compression, determine the final compressed length of the specimen such that (a) the engineering strain is equal to the same value as in tension (it will be negative value because of compression), and (b) the true strain would be equal to the same value as in tension (again, it will be negative value because of compression). Note that the answer to part (a) is an impossible result. True strain is therefore a better measure of strain during plastic deformation.","Solution: Engineering strain e = (2.0 -1.0)/1.0 = 1.0 True strain H = ln(2.0/1.0) = ln(2.0) = 0.693 (a) To be compressed to the same engineering strain (e = -1.0) the final height of the compression specimen would have to be zero, which is impossible.  (b) To be compressed to the same true strain value (e = -0.693) the final height of the compression specimen can be determined as follows: H = -.693 = ln(Lf/Lo) Lf/Lo = exp.(-0.693) = 0.500 Therefore, Lf = 0.5 Lo","To solve this problem, we'll first calculate the engineering strain and true strain during the tensile test, and then determine the equivalent compressed lengths for the given conditions.

### Tensile Test:
1. **Engineering Strain (\( \varepsilon \))**:  
   Engineering strain is defined as the change in length divided by the original length.  
   Since the specimen is elongated to twice its original length:

   \[
   \varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0} = \frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{2L_0 - L_0}{L_0} = 1
   \]

   So, the engineering strain is 1 (or 100%).

2. **True Strain (\( \varepsilon_t \))**:  
   True strain is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the final length to the original length:

   \[
   \varepsilon_t = \ln \left(\frac{L_f}{L_0}\right) = \ln(2)
   \]

   \(\ln(2) \approx 0.693\).

### Compression Test:

Now we need to find the new lengths in compression for the specified conditions.

#### (a) Same Engineering Strain in Compression:

For the engineering strain in compression to be equal to -1 (the negative of the tensile strain), the final length \((L_f)\) can be calculated as:

\[
\varepsilon = \frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0} = -1 \implies L_f - L_0 = -L_0 \implies L_f = 0
\]

This implies a physically impossible situation, where the compressed length would be zero, highlighting a limitation in using engineering strain as a measure.

#### (b) Same True Strain in Compression:

For the true strain in compression to be equal to \(-\ln(2)\), we set:

\[
\varepsilon_t = \ln \left(\frac{L_f}{L_0}\right) = -\ln(2) \implies \ln \left(\frac{L_f}{L_0}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Exponentiating both sides, we get:

\[
\frac{L_f}{L_0} = \frac{1}{2} \implies L_f = \frac{L_0}{2}
\]

Thus, the final compressed length of the specimen would be \(L_0 / 2\), which is a realistic scenario and highlights the advantages of using true strain as it accounts for continuous deformation.",3.0,3.12
"Derive an expression for true strain as a function of D and Do for a tensile test specimen of round cross section, where D = the instantaneous diameter of the specimen and Do is its original diameter.","Solution: Starting with the definition of true strain as H = ln(L/Lo) and assuming constant volume, we have V = AoLo = AL Therefore, L/Lo = Ao/A       A =pi D^2 and Ao =pi Do^2 and A0=piD^2        Ao/A = piDo^2/piD^2 = (Do/D)2 H = ln(Do/D)2 = 2ln(Do/D)","True strain, often denoted as \(\varepsilon_t\), for a tensile test specimen can be derived from the definition of true strain in terms of infinitesimal changes in length. For a specimen with a round cross-section, we can express this in terms of the changes in area:

1. **True Strain Definition**: True strain is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of instantaneous length to the original length. In terms of area \(A\), this becomes:

   \[
   \varepsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{A}{A_0}\right)
   \]

   where \(A_0\) is the original cross-sectional area and \(A\) is the instantaneous cross-sectional area.

2. **Cross-sectional Area Relation**: For a round specimen,

   \[
   A = \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \quad \text{and} \quad A_0 = \frac{\pi D_0^2}{4}
   \]

3. **Substituting the Areas**: The true strain expression becomes:

   \[
   \varepsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{\frac{\pi D^2}{4}}{\frac{\pi D_0^2}{4}}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{D^2}{D_0^2}\right)
   \]

4. **Using Logarithm Properties**: Simplify using the properties of logarithms:

   \[
   \varepsilon_t = 2 \ln\left(\frac{D}{D_0}\right)
   \]

Therefore, the expression for true strain \(\varepsilon_t\) as a function of the instantaneous diameter \(D\) and the original diameter \(D_0\) is:

\[
\varepsilon_t = 2 \ln\left(\frac{D}{D_0}\right)
\] 

This expression captures the change in geometry of the specimen as it is stretched during a tensile test.",3.0,3.13
"Show that true strain H = ln(1 + e), where e = engineering strain.","Solution: Starting definitions: (1) H = ln(L/Lo) and (2) e = (L -Lo)/Lo Consider definition (2): e = L/Lo -Lo/Lo = L/Lo -1 Rearranging, 1 + e = L/Lo Substituting this into definition (1), H = ln(1 + e)","To derive the relationship between true strain \( H \) and engineering strain \( e \), we start by defining these two types of strain.

**Engineering Strain:**

The engineering strain (\( e \)) is defined as the ratio of the change in length (\( \Delta L \)) to the original length (\( L_0 \)):

\[
e = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0} = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{L}{L_0} - 1
\]

Here, \( L \) is the final length after deformation.

**True Strain:**

True strain (\( H \)) is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the final length to the original length:

\[
H = \ln \left( \frac{L}{L_0} \right)
\]

**Relationship Derivation:**

To express true strain \( H \) in terms of engineering strain \( e \), we can use the definition of \( e \) to express \( \frac{L}{L_0} \):

\[
L = L_0 (1 + e)
\]

Substituting this expression into the equation for true strain:

\[
H = \ln \left( \frac{L}{L_0} \right) = \ln \left( \frac{L_0 (1 + e)}{L_0} \right) = \ln (1 + e)
\]

Thus, we have shown that:

\[
H = \ln (1 + e)
\]

This is the relationship between true strain and engineering strain.",3.0,3.14

However, it should be noted that these values are associated with the necked portion of the test specimen.","To determine the true stress and true strain at failure, we can use the relationships between engineering stress-strain and true stress-strain. Let's break down the given information and calculate the required values.

1. **Engineering Stress** is given as \( \sigma_{\text{eng}} = 248.2 \, \text{MPa} \).

2. **Ductility** is given as a 75% reduction in area, indicating that the final area is 25% of the original area.

Let's calculate the true stress and true strain:

### True Stress
True stress is defined as the load divided by the actual cross-sectional area at the point of fracture. It can be calculated using:

\[
\sigma_{\text{true}} = \sigma_{\text{eng}} \times \frac{A_0}{A_f}
\]

Given that the reduction in area is 75%, the final area \( A_f \) is \( 25\% \) of the original area \( A_0 \), meaning:

\[
\frac{A_0}{A_f} = \frac{1}{0.25} = 4
\]

Thus, the true stress at failure is:

\[
\sigma_{\text{true}} = 248.2 \, \text{MPa} \times 4 = 992.8 \, \text{MPa}
\]

### True Strain
True strain (\( \varepsilon_{\text{true}} \)) is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of final to original lengths, which corresponds, based on area, to:

\[
\varepsilon_{\text{true}} = \ln \left(\frac{A_0}{A_f}\right)
\]

"A steel tensile specimen with starting gage length = 2.0 in and cross-sectional area = 0.5 in2 reaches a maximum load of 37,000 lb. Its elongation at this point is 24%.

### True Stress
True stress (\(\sigma_t\)) is defined as the force divided by the actual cross-sectional area (\(A_t\)) at that load.

Given:
- Maximum Load (\(P\)) = 37,000 lb
- Initial Cross-Sectional Area (\(A_0\)) = 0.5 in²
- Elongation = 24%

The elongation of 24% indicates that the length of the specimen has increased by 24% at the maximum load. The true stress is calculated using the following steps:

1. **Calculate the instantaneous length at maximum load:**

   \[ L_t = L_0 \times (1 + \text{percent elongation}) \]

   Given:
   - \( L_0 = 2.0 \, \text{in} \)

   \[ L_t = 2.0 \, \text{in} \times (1 + 0.24) = 2.48 \, \text{in} \]

2. **Assume volume constancy to calculate the true cross-sectional area:**

   Since the volume is assumed constant throughout the deformation:

   - Initial volume: \( V_0 = A_0 \times L_0 \)
   - True volume: \( V_t = A_t \times L_t \)

   Therefore:

   \[ A_t = \frac{A_0 \times L_0}{L_t} \]
   \[ A_t = \frac{0.5 \, \text{in}^2 \times 2.0 \, \text{in}}{2.48 \, \text{in}} = \frac{1.0 \, \text{in}^3}{2.48 \, \text{in}} \approx 0.4032 \, \text{in}^2 \]

3. **Calculate true stress:**

   \[ \sigma_t = \frac{P}{A_t} = \frac{37,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.4032 \, \text{in}^2} \approx 91,764 \, \text{psi} \]

### True Strain
True strain (\(\epsilon_t\)) is the natural logarithm of the ratio of the current gage length to the original gage length.

\[
\epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{L_t}{L_0}\right) = \ln(1 + \text{percent elongation})
\]

\[
\epsilon_t = \ln(1 + 0.24) \approx \ln(1.24) \approx 0.215
\]

Thus, at the maximum load, the true stress is approximately 91,764 psi, and the true strain is approximately 0.215.",3.0,3.17
"A metal alloy has been tested in a tensile test with the following results for the flow curve parameters: strength coefficient = 620.5 MPa and strain-hardening exponent = 0.26. The same metal is now tested in a compression test in which the starting height of the specimen = 62.5 mm and its diameter = 25 mm. Assuming that the cross section increases uniformly, determine the load required to compress the specimen to a height of (a) 50 mm ","Solution: Starting volume of test specimen V = pi*hDo^ 2/4 = 62.5pi(25)^2/4 = 30679.6 mm3. (a) At h = 50 mm, H = ln(62.5/50) = ln(1.25) = 0.223 Yf = 620.5(.223)^.26 = 420.1 MPa A = V/L = 30679.6/50 = 613.6 mm2 F = 420.1(613.6) = 257,770 N  ","To determine the load required to compress the specimen, we need to consider the metal's behavior as it deforms. In this scenario, the flow curve equation, which relates true stress (\(\sigma\)) and true strain (\(\epsilon\)) for the metal, is given by:

\[ \sigma = K \cdot \epsilon^n \]

where:
- \( K = 620.5 \) MPa is the strength coefficient,
- \( n = 0.26 \) is the strain-hardening exponent.

1. **Calculate the true strain (\(\epsilon\))**: 

   True strain in compression can be calculated using the formula:
   \[ \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{h_0}{h_f}\right) \]

   where:
   - \( h_0 = 62.5 \, \text{mm} \) is the original height,
   - \( h_f = 50 \, \text{mm} \) is the final height.

   \[ \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{62.5}{50}\right) = \ln(1.25) \approx 0.2231 \]

2. **Calculate the true stress (\(\sigma\))** using the flow curve equation:

   \[ \sigma = 620.5 \cdot (0.2231)^{0.26} \]

   Calculating the value,
   \[ \sigma = 620.5 \cdot 0.5885 \approx 365.13 \, \text{MPa} \]

3. **Determine the final cross-sectional area (A_f)** of the specimen:

   Volume is constant during deformation (assuming incompressibility), so the initial volume is equal to the final volume:

   \[ A_0 \cdot h_0 = A_f \cdot h_f \]

   where:
   - \( A_0 = \pi \left(\frac{d_0}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \left(\frac{25}{2}\right)^2 = 490.87 \, \text{mm}^2 \) is the initial cross-sectional area.

   Solving for \( A_f \):

   \[ A_f = \frac{A_0 \cdot h_0}{h_f} = \frac{490.87 \times 62.5}{50} \approx 613.59 \, \text{mm}^2 \]

4. **Calculate the load (F)** required:

   The load is the product of the true stress and the final cross-sectional area:

   \[ F = \sigma \cdot A_f \]

   \[ F = 365.13 \, \text{MPa} \cdot 613.59 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2 \]

   Converting MPa to N/mm² for consistency with mm²:

   \[ F = 365.13 \times 613.59 \approx 223,953.27 \, \text{N} \]

Thus, the load required to compress the specimen to a height of \(50 \, \text{mm}\) is approximately \(223,953 \, \text{N}\) or \(224 \, \text{kN}\).",3.0,3.18

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Initial and Final States:**
   - Initial height \( h_0 = 62.5 \) mm.
   - Final height \( h_f = 37.5 \) mm.
   - Initial diameter \( d_0 = 25 \) mm.

2. **Calculate True Strain (\(\varepsilon\)):**

   True strain in compression is given by:
   \[
   \varepsilon = \ln\left(\frac{h_0}{h_f}\right)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \varepsilon = \ln\left(\frac{62.5}{37.5}\right) = \ln(1.6667) \approx 0.5108
   \]

3. **True Stress Calculation Using Flow Curve Equation:**

   The flow curve equation is given by:
   \[
   \sigma = K \varepsilon^n
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \sigma = 620.5 \times (0.5108)^{0.26}
   \]
   \[
   \sigma \approx 620.5 \times 0.8221 \approx 510.09 \text{ MPa}
   \]

4. **Calculate Cross-Sectional Area:**

   Since the material is assumed incompressible, the volume remains constant:
   \[
   A_0 \times h_0 = A_f \times h_f
   \]
   Initial area \( A_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} d_0^2 = \frac{\pi}{4} \times (25)^2 = 490.87 \text{ mm}^2\).
   Solve for final area \( A_f \):
   \[
   A_f = \frac{A_0 \times h_0}{h_f} = \frac{490.87 \times 62.5}{37.5}
   \]
   \[
   A_f = 818.12 \text{ mm}^2
   \]

5. **Calculate Load (P):**

   The load is given by the product of the true stress and the final cross-sectional area:
   \[
   P = \sigma \times A_f = 510.09 \times 818.12 \text{ N or MPa mm}^2
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   P \approx 417,561 \text{ N} = 417.56 \text{ kN}
   \]

Thus, a compressive load of approximately **417.56 kN** is required to compress the specimen to a height of 37.5 mm.",3.0,3.18

At a load of 260,000 lb, the height has been reduced to 1.6 in. Determine (a) yield strength.","Solution: (a) Starting volume of test specimen V = h*pi*D2/4 = 2(1.5)^2/4 = 3.534 in3. Ao = Do/4 = (1.5)^2/4 = 1.767 in2 Y = 140,000/1.767 = 79,224 lb/in2","To determine the yield strength of the steel specimen, we need to calculate the stress at which yielding occurs using the 0.2% offset method. The yield strength is the stress corresponding to this yield point.

First, we calculate the cross-sectional area of the specimen:

For a circular cross-section with diameter \( d = 1.5 \) in, the area \( A \) is given by:
\[
A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} = \frac{\pi (1.5)^2}{4} = \frac{\pi \times 2.25}{4} \approx 1.767 \, \text{in}^2

2. Substitute and calculate \(P\):
   \[
   P = \frac{2 \times 1000 \times 1500}{3 \times 60} = \frac{3000000}{180}

3. Divide 3000000 by 180:
   \[
   P = 16666.67 \text{ N}

\]

where:
- \(\sigma_{\text{fs}}\) is the transverse rupture strength.
- \(P\) is the load at fracture (1700 lb).
- \(L\) is the length between supports (2.0 in).
- \(b\) is the width of the specimen (0.50 in).
- \(t\) is the thickness of the specimen (0.25 in).

\[
\sigma_{\text{fs}} = \frac{3 \times 1700 \times 2.0}{2 \times 0.50 \times 0.0625}

\[
\sigma_{\text{fs}} = \frac{10200}{0.0625}

### (a) Shear Stress (\(\tau\)):
The shear stress (\(\tau\)) in a hollow circular shaft subjected to a torque (\(T\)) is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{T \cdot c}{J}
\]

where:
- \(T\) is the applied torque.
- \(c\) is the outer radius of the shaft.
- \(J\) is the polar moment of inertia for a hollow circular shaft, given by:
  
  \[
  J = \frac{\pi}{2} (c^4 - a^4)

  - \(c\) is the outer radius,
  - \(a\) is the inner radius.

Given:
- Outer radius, \(c = 25 \, \text{mm} = 0.025 \, \text{m}\)
- Thickness, \(t = 3 \, \text{mm} = 0.003 \, \text{m}\)

The inner radius, \(a = c - t = 0.025 \, \text{m} - 0.003 \, \text{m} = 0.022 \, \text{m}\).

Let's compute \(J\):

\[
J = \frac{\pi}{2} ((0.025)^4 - (0.022)^4) = \frac{\pi}{2} (3.90625 \times 10^{-7} - 2.35168 \times 10^{-7})
\]

\[
J \approx \frac{\pi}{2} \times 1.55457 \times 10^{-7} \approx 2.44 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}^4

Now compute \(\tau\):

\[
\tau = \frac{900 \, \text{N}\cdot\text{m} \times 0.025 \, \text{m}}{2.44 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}^4} \approx 9.23 \times 10^{5} \, \text{N/m}^2 = 923 \, \text{MPa}

### (a) Shear Stress

For a thin-walled tube, the formula for shear stress \((\tau)\) is:
\[
\tau = \frac{T}{2\pi r t}
\]
Where:
- \( T \) is the applied torque,
- \( r \) is the mean radius of the tube,
- \( t \) is the wall thickness.

Substitute the given values:
- \( T = 5000 \, \text{ft-lb} = 60,000 \, \text{in-lb} \) (because 1 ft = 12 in),
- \( r = 1.5 \, \text{in} \),
- \( t = 0.10 \, \text{in} \).

\[
\tau = \frac{60,000}{2\pi \times 1.5 \times 0.10}

Calculate \(\tau\):
\[
\tau = \frac{60,000}{0.9424778} \approx 63,695 \, \text{psi}

Shear strain \((\gamma)\) is related to the angle of twist \((\theta)\), the radius \((r)\), and the gage length \((L)\) by the formula:
\[
\gamma = \frac{r \theta}{L}

The angle of deflection given is \(1^\circ\), which is approximately \(\frac{\pi}{180}\) radians.

Calculate \(\gamma\):
\[
\gamma \approx \frac{1.5 \times 0.0174533}{2} \approx 0.01308

For a tested hardness of HB = 182, TS = 500(182) = 91,000 lb/in2.","To determine the Brinell hardness number (BHN) for the metal, we can use the Brinell hardness formula:

\[
BHN = \frac{2P}{\pi D (D - \sqrt{D^2 - d^2})}

- \(P\) is the load in kilograms-force (kgf),
- \(D\) is the diameter of the ball indenter in millimeters (mm),
- \(d\) is the diameter of the indentation in millimeters (mm).

Given:
\(P = 1500 \, \text{kgf}\),
\(D = 10 \, \text{mm}\),
\(d = 3.2 \, \text{mm}\).

Let's plug in the numbers:

\[
BHN = \frac{2 \times 1500}{\pi \times 10 \left(10 - \sqrt{10^2 - 3.2^2}\right)}

First, calculate \( \sqrt{D^2 - d^2} \):

\[
\sqrt{10^2 - 3.2^2} = \sqrt{100 - 10.24} = \sqrt{89.76} \approx 9.475

Now substituting back:

\[
BHN = \frac{3000}{\pi \times 10 \left(10 - 9.475\right)} = \frac{3000}{\pi \times 10 \times 0.525}

\[
BHN = \frac{3000}{16.493}

\[
BHN \approx 182

\[
\text{Tensile Strength} \approx 3.5 \times 182 = 637 \, \text{MPa}

Thus, the estimated tensile strength of the steel is approximately 637 MPa.",3.0,3.25
"One of the inspectors in the quality control department has frequently used the Brinell and Rockwell hardness tests, for which equipment is available in the company.

(a) Is he correct? (b) If not, what are some of the other principles involved in hardness testing, and what are the associated tests?","Solution: (a) No, the claim is not correct. Not all hardness tests are based on the applied load divided by area, but many of them are. (b) Some of the other hardness tests and operating principles include: (1) Rockwell hardness test, which measures the depth of indentation of a cone resulting from an applied load; (2) Scleroscope, which measures the rebound height of a hammer dropped from a certain distance against a surface specimen; and (3) Durometer, which measures elastic deformation by pressing an indentor into the surface of rubber and similar soft materials.","(a) The inspector is not entirely correct. While the Brinell hardness test indeed measures hardness based on the principle of applied load divided by the surface area of the indentation, not all hardness tests follow this exact principle.

(b) Other hardness tests involve different principles and methodologies:

1. **Rockwell Hardness Test**: This test measures hardness based on the depth of penetration under a large load compared to the penetration made under a preliminary minor load. It uses a different scale system based on the depth of indentation rather than the surface area.

2. **Vickers Hardness Test**: Similar to the Brinell test, the Vickers test calculates hardness by dividing the applied load by the surface area of the indentation. However, it uses a diamond pyramid indenter, which allows it to be used for both macro and micro hardness testing.

3. **Knoop Hardness Test**: This test measures the hardness based on an elongated diamond indenter that produces an indentation with a long diagonal. The hardness number is derived from the load over the projected area of the indentation, making it suitable for brittle materials or thin specimens.

4. **Shore Scleroscope Test**: This is a dynamic hardness test that measures the rebound height of a diamond-tipped hammer dropped from a known height onto the material. The principle here is entirely different as it relates to elastic rebound rather than indentation size or depth.

5. **Mohs Hardness Scale**: Unlike the other tests mentioned, the Mohs scale is a relative hardness scale based on a material's ability to scratch another material. It is a qualitative rather than quantitative measure and does not involve applied loads or indentation.

Each of these tests has its own set of standards and is suitable for different types of materials and applications.",3.0,3.26

However, from a legal standpoint, it is unlikely that the batch can be rejected on the basis of its measured Brinell hardness number without using an actual tensile test to measure TS. The formula for converting from Brinell hardness number to tensile strength is only an approximating equation. ","To determine if the steel meets the specified tensile strength, we can use the empirical correlation between Brinell hardness number (HB) and tensile strength for steels. The tensile strength \(\sigma\) in psi can be estimated from the Brinell hardness using the following approximate relationship:

\[
\sigma (\text{psi}) \approx HB \times 500
\]

For the given HB of 118:

\[
\sigma \approx 118 \times 500 = 59,000 \, \text{psi}
\]

The measured tensile strength is 59,000 psi, which is slightly below the specified range of 60,000 - 70,000 psi. Therefore, based on the Brinell hardness test and this approximation, the steel does not meet the specified tensile strength requirement. However, it's important to note that this relationship is an estimate and additional testing may be warranted for confirmation.",3.0,3.27
"A batch of annealed steel has just been received from the vendor. It is supposed to have a tensile strength in the range 60,000 -70,000 lb/in2.

(b) Estimate the yield strength of the material.","Solution:  (b) Based on Table 3.2 in the text, the ratio of Y to TS for low carbon steel = 25,000/45,000 =0.555. Using this ratio, we can estimate the yield strength to be Y = 0.555(59,000) = 32,700 lb/in2.","To estimate the yield strength from the given Brinell hardness number (HB), you can use an empirical relationship that relates the Brinell hardness number to tensile strength and yield strength for steel. One common approximation for estimating yield strength (\(\sigma_y\)) based on the Brinell hardness number is:

\[
\sigma_y \approx \frac{HB}{3}
\]

Given that the Brinell hardness (HB) is 118, you can estimate the yield strength as follows:

\[
\sigma_y \approx \frac{118}{3} \approx 39.33 \text{ ksi (or 39,330 psi)}
\]

This is a general estimation, and the actual yield strength may vary depending on the specific composition and treatment of the steel. It's also important to note that this empirical relationship is more accurate for steels where the Brinell hardness is above 150. With a lower Brinell hardness like 118, there may be increased variability, so consider this an approximation.",3.0,3.27
"Two flat plates, separated by a space of 4 mm, are moving relative to each other at a velocity of 5 m/sec. The space between them is occupied by a fluid of unknown viscosity.

Assuming that the velocity gradient of the fluid is constant, determine the coefficient of viscosity of the fluid.",Solution: Shear rate = (5 m/s x 1000 mm/m)/(4 mm) = 1250 s-1 K = (10N/m2)/(1250 s-1) = 0.008 N-s/m2 = 0.008 Pa-s,"To determine the coefficient of viscosity of the fluid, we can use the formula that relates shear stress (\(\tau\)), velocity gradient (\(\frac{du}{dy}\)), and viscosity (\(\mu\)):

\[
\tau = \mu \frac{du}{dy}

Where:
- \(\tau\) is the shear stress (10 Pa),
- \(\mu\) is the dynamic viscosity,
- \(\frac{du}{dy}\) is the velocity gradient.

The velocity gradient \(\frac{du}{dy}\) is the change in velocity (\(du\)) divided by the separation between the plates (\(dy\)):

\[
\frac{du}{dy} = \frac{v}{d}

Where:
- \(\tau\) is the shear stress (0.3 lb/in²)
- \(\mu\) is the dynamic viscosity
- \(\frac{du}{dy}\) is the velocity gradient

The velocity gradient for a constant velocity gradient scenario is the change in velocity (\(\Delta u\)) divided by the distance between the two surfaces (\(\Delta y\)):

Given:
- \(\Delta u = 25 \, \text{in/sec}\) (velocity difference between the two surfaces)
- \(\Delta y = 0.5 \, \text{in}\) (distance between the two surfaces)

A 125.0-mm-diameter shaft rotates inside a stationary bushing whose inside diameter = 125.6 mm and length = 50.0 mm. In the clearance between the shaft and the bushing is a lubricating oil whose viscosity = 0.14 Pa-s. The shaft rotates at a velocity of 400 rev/min; this speed and the action of the oil are sufficient to keep the shaft centered inside the bushing.

This shear causes a resistive torque.

First, let's summarize the given data:
- Diameter of shaft, \(d_s = 125.0\) mm = 0.125 m
- Diameter of bushing, \(d_b = 125.6\) mm = 0.1256 m
- Clearance, \(c = \frac{d_b - d_s}{2} = \frac{0.1256 - 0.1250}{2} = 0.0003\) m
- Length of bushing, \(L = 50.0\) mm = 0.050 m
- Viscosity of oil, \(\mu = 0.14\) Pa·s
- Rotation speed, \(N = 400\) rev/min

1. **Convert the rotational speed to radians per second:**
   \[
   \omega = 400 \, \text{rev/min} \times \frac{2\pi \, \text{rad}}{1 \, \text{rev}} \times \frac{1 \, \text{min}}{60 \, \text{s}} = \frac{800\pi}{60} \, \text{rad/s} = \frac{40\pi}{3} \, \text{rad/s}
   \]

2. **Calculate the shear stress:**
   The shear stress \(\tau\) is given by:
   \[
   \tau = \mu \cdot \frac{u}{c}
   \]
   where \(u = \omega \cdot r\) is the linear velocity of the shaft surface and \(r = \frac{d_s}{2} = 0.0625\) m.
   \[
   u = \frac{40\pi}{3} \, \text{rad/s} \times 0.0625 \, \text{m} = \frac{40\pi \cdot 0.0625}{3} \, \text{m/s}

   Substituting in the known values:
   \[
   \tau = 0.14 \, \text{Pa} \cdot \text{s} \times \frac{40\pi \cdot 0.0625}{3 \times 0.0003}
   \]

3. **Calculate the torque:**
   The torque \(T\) is determined by integrating the shear stress over the surface area of the cylinder:
   \[
   T = \int \tau \cdot r \, dA = \int \tau \cdot r \cdot (r \, d\theta \cdot L) = \tau \cdot r^2 \cdot L \cdot \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = \tau \cdot r^2 \cdot L \cdot 2\pi
   \]
   Substituting \(\tau\):
   \[
   T = \left( 0.14 \, \text{Pa} \cdot \text{s} \times \frac{40\pi \cdot 0.0625}{3 \times 0.0003} \right) \cdot (0.0625)^2 \cdot 0.050 \cdot 2\pi
   \]

Calculating:
\[
u = \frac{40\pi \times 0.0625}{3} \approx 2.617993 \, \text{m/s}
\]
\[
\tau \approx 0.14 \times \frac{2.617993}{0.0003} \approx 1222.463 \, \text{Pa}

\[
T \approx 1222.463 \times (0.0625)^2 \times 0.050 \times 2\pi \approx 0.14946 \, \text{N}\cdot\text{m}

Where:
- \( \Delta L \) is the change in length (or diameter in this case).
- \( L_0 \) is the initial length (or diameter).
- \( \alpha \) is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion for the material.
- \( \Delta T \) is the change in temperature (final temperature - initial temperature).

This requires using the coefficient of linear thermal expansion for aluminum.

Table 4.1 likely contains the coefficient of linear thermal expansion for aluminum, which is typically around \(22 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{°C}^{-1}\). Keep in mind that since density is a volumetric property, the volume expansion will be considered over three dimensions (length, width, height).

First, calculate the change in temperature:

\[
\Delta T = 650^\circ C - 20^\circ C = 630^\circ C
\]

The change in linear dimensions due to thermal expansion is given by:

\[
\Delta L = L_0 \times \alpha \times \Delta T
\]

However, for volume expansion, we use the volume expansion formula, which is approximated by:

\[
\Delta V / V_0 = 3 \times \alpha \times \Delta T
\]

where:
- \(V_0\) is the initial volume,
- \(\Delta V\) is the change in volume,
- \(\alpha\) is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion.

Substituting in the values, we have:

\[
\Delta V / V_0 = 3 \times (22 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{°C}^{-1}) \times 630 \, \text{°C}
\]

\[
\Delta V / V_0 \approx 0.04158
\]

This means the volume increases by approximately 4.158%. Since density decreases as volume increases (mass remains constant), the new density \(\rho\) at 650°C can be calculated as:

\[
\rho = \frac{\rho_0}{1 + \Delta V / V_0}

Where \(\rho_0 = 2.70 \, \text{g/cm}^3\):

\[
\rho = \frac{2.70 \, \text{g/cm}^3}{1 + 0.04158}

\[
\rho \approx \frac{2.70 \, \text{g/cm}^3}{1.04158}

- \(L_0\) is the original length of the bar (10.0 inches in this case),
- \(\alpha\) is the coefficient of linear expansion for steel,

where:
- \( R \) is the resistance,
- \( \rho \) is the resistivity of the material,
- \( L \) is the length of the wire,
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the wire.

### Step-by-step Calculation

1. **Determine the resistivity \(\rho\) of copper:**
   - The resistivity of copper (\(\rho\)) is typically around \(1.68 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m}\).

2. **Length \( L \) of the wire:**

3. **Calculate the cross-sectional area \( A \):**
   - Given the diameter of the wire \( d = 0.10 \, \text{mm} = 0.10 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}\).
   - The radius \( r \) is half of the diameter: 
     \[ r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{0.10 \times 10^{-3}}{2} \, \text{m} \]

Since nickel is a metal, the resistivity would increase, causing the resistance to increase. This, in turn, would cause slightly more heat to be generated.","To determine the resistance of the wire and the effect of temperature on its resistance, we'll break down the problem into two parts.

### (a) Calculating the Resistance of the Wire

To calculate the resistance \( R \) of the wire, use the formula:

\[ R = \rho \frac{L}{A} \]

where:
- \( R \) is the resistance,
- \( \rho \) is the resistivity of the material (nickel, in this case),
- \( L \) is the length of the wire,
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the wire.

**Step 1: Resistivity of Nickel**

From a table of material properties (like Table 4.3), you would find the resistivity (\( \rho \)) of nickel. For nickel, a typical resistivity value at room temperature is approximately \( 6.99 \times 10^{-7} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \).

**Step 2: Convert Length to Meters**

Given the length \( L \) in feet, convert to meters:

\[ L = 32.8 \, \text{ft} \times 0.3048 \, \text{m/ft} = 9.99744 \, \text{m} \]

**Step 3: Calculate Cross-Sectional Area**

The diameter of the wire is 0.0508 inches. Convert this to meters:

\[ d = 0.0508 \, \text{in} \times 0.0254 \, \text{m/in} = 0.00129032 \, \text{m} \]

The cross-sectional area \( A \) (assuming a circular cross-section) is:

\[ A = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \left(\frac{0.00129032}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \times 0.00064516^2 \approx 3.27054 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}^2 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the Resistance**

Now plug in the values into the resistance formula:

\[ R = 6.99 \times 10^{-7} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \, \frac{9.99744 \, \text{m}}{3.27054 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}^2} \]

\[ R \approx 21.37 \, \Omega \]

### (b) Effect of Temperature on the Resistance

When current passes through the wire, it heats up, causing an increase in the resistance. This is described by the temperature coefficient of resistance. For most metals, resistance \( R \) increases linearly with temperature according to:

\[ R(T) = R_0 [1 + \alpha (T - T_0)] \]

where:
- \( R(T) \) is the resistance at temperature \( T \),
- \( R_0 \) is the original resistance at reference temperature \( T_0 \),
- \( \alpha \) is the temperature coefficient of resistance for the material.

For nickel, the coefficient is approximately \( 0.006 \, \text{per} \, ^\circ \text{C} \) at room temperature. As the temperature of the wire increases, for example due to heating from the current, the resistance will increase.

In summary, the resistance of the wire is approximately \( 21.37 \, \Omega \) at room temperature, and it increases with temperature due to the intrinsic properties of nickel.",4.0,4.7

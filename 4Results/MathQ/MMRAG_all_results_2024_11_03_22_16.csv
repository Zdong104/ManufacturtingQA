This is the 0.2 percent yield point. The maximum load of 168,000 N is reached at a gage length = 
64.2 mm. D. Determine (a) yield strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, and (c) tensile strength. ","Solution: (a) Y = 98,000/200 = 490 MPa. (b) s = E e Subtracting the 0.2% offset, e = (50.23 -50.0)/50.0 -0.002 = 0.0026 E = s/e = 490/0.0026 = 188.5 x 103 MPa.  (c) TS = 168,000/200 = 840 MPa.  ","To address the given problem, we'll tackle each component individually— (a) yield strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, and (c) tensile strength. Each will be explained step by step:

### (a) Yield Strength

Yield strength (\( \sigma_y \)) is calculated by dividing the yield load by the original cross-sectional area of the specimen.

1. **Identify the yield load**: Given as 98,000 N.
2. **Original cross-sectional area**: Given as 200 mm².

The formula for yield strength is:

\[ \sigma_y = \frac{\text{Yield Load}}{\text{Original Area}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \sigma_y = \frac{98,000 \, \text{N}}{200 \, \text{mm}^2} = 490 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \]

This is the yield strength.

### (b) Modulus of Elasticity

The modulus of elasticity (\( E \)) is determined using the stress and strain from the initial part of the test, specifically the yield point. It is defined as:

\[ E = \frac{\text{Stress at yield point}}{\text{Strain at yield point}} \]

3. **Calculate the stress at yield point**: This is essentially the yield strength previously calculated, which is 490 N/mm².

4. **Calculate the strain at yield point**: 
   \[
   \text{Strain} = \frac{\text{Change in Length}}{\text{Original Length}} = \frac{50.23 \, \text{mm} - 50 \, \text{mm}}{50 \, \text{mm}} = \frac{0.23 \, \text{mm}}{50 \, \text{mm}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Strain} = 0.0046
   \]

5. **Calculate the modulus of elasticity**:
   \[
   E = \frac{490 \, \text{N/mm}^2}{0.0046} = 106,522 \, \text{N/mm}^2
   \]

### (c) Tensile Strength

Tensile strength is defined as the maximum load divided by the original cross-sectional area.

6. **Identify the maximum load**: Given as 168,000 N.

The formula for tensile strength (\( \sigma_t \)) is:

\[ \sigma_t = \frac{\text{Maximum Load}}{\text{Original Area}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \sigma_t = \frac{168,000 \, \text{N}}{200 \, \text{mm}^2} = 840 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \]

This is the tensile strength.

In summary:
- (a) **Yield Strength** = 490 N/mm²
- (b) **Modulus of Elasticity** = 106,522 N/mm²
- (c) **Tensile Strength** = 840 N/mm²",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.01
"A test specimen in a tensile test has a gage length of 2.0 in and an area = 0.5 in2. During the test the specimen yields under a load of 32,000 lb. The corresponding gage length = 2.0083 in. This is the 0.2 percent yield point. The maximum load of 60,000 lb is reached at a gage length = 2.60 in. Determine (a) yield strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, and (c) tensile strength. (d) If fracture occurs at a gage length of 2.92 in, determine the percent elongation. (e) If the specimen necked to an area = 0.25 in2, determine the percent reduction in area.","Solution: (a) Y = 32,000/0.5 = 64,000 lb/in2 (b) s = E e Subtracting the 0.2% offset, e = (2.0083 -2.0)/2.0 -0.002 = 0.00215 E = s/e = 64,000/0.00215 = 29.77 x 106 lb/in2  (c) TS = 60,000/0.5 = 120,000 lb/in2  (d) EL = (2.92 -2.0)/2.0 = 0.92/2.0 = 0.46 = 46%  (e) AR = (0.5 -0.25)/0.5 = 0.50 = 50%","To solve this problem, we'll address each part using the provided data and standard formulas for tensile tests. Let's calculate each requested value step-by-step:

### (a) Yield Strength

**Yield strength** is defined as the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically. To find the yield strength at the 0.2% offset, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Yield Strength} = \frac{\text{Yield Load}}{\text{Original Cross-sectional Area}} \]

Given:
- Yield Load = 32,000 lb
- Original Area = 0.5 in²

\[ \text{Yield Strength} = \frac{32,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} = 64,000 \, \text{psi} \]

### (b) Modulus of Elasticity

The **modulus of elasticity** (E), also known as Young's modulus, can be calculated using the stress-strain relationship in the linear elastic region:

\[ E = \frac{\text{Stress}}{\text{Strain}} \]

- Stress at yield point = Yield Strength = 64,000 psi
- Strain at yield point = Change in length / Original length = \(\frac{2.0083 \, \text{in} - 2.0 \, \text{in}}{2.0 \, \text{in}} = 0.00415\)

\[ E = \frac{64,000 \, \text{psi}}{0.00415} = 15,421,686 \, \text{psi} \approx 15.4 \times 10^6 \, \text{psi} \]

### (c) Tensile Strength

**Tensile strength** is the maximum stress that a material can withstand while being stretched before necking:

\[ \text{Tensile Strength} = \frac{\text{Maximum Load}}{\text{Original Cross-sectional Area}} \]

Given:
- Maximum Load = 60,000 lb
- Original Area = 0.5 in²

\[ \text{Tensile Strength} = \frac{60,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} = 120,000 \, \text{psi} \]

### (d) Percent Elongation

Percent elongation is a measure of ductility and is defined as:

\[ \text{Percent Elongation} = \left( \frac{\text{Final Gage Length} - \text{Original Gage Length}}{\text{Original Gage Length}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Given:
- Final Gage Length = 2.92 in

\[ \text{Percent Elongation} = \left( \frac{2.92 \, \text{in} - 2.0 \, \text{in}}{2.0 \, \text{in}} \right) \times 100\% = 46\% \]

### (e) Percent Reduction in Area

Percent reduction in area is another measure of ductility and is defined as:

\[ \text{Percent Reduction in Area} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Area} - \text{Necked Area}}{\text{Original Area}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Given:
- Original Area = 0.5 in²
- Necked Area = 0.25 in²

\[ \text{Percent Reduction in Area} = \left( \frac{0.5 \, \text{in}^2 - 0.25 \, \text{in}^2}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} \right) \times 100\% = 50\% \]

"During a tensile test in which the starting gage length = 125.0 mm and the cross-sectional area = 62.5 mm2, the following force and gage length data are collected (1) 17,793 N at 125.23 mm, (2) 23,042 N at 131.25 mm, (3) 27,579 N at 140.05 mm, (4) 28, 913 N at 147.01 mm, (5) 27,578 N at 153.00 mm, and (6) 20,462 N at 160.10 mm.

(d) From the plot, TS = 462.6 MPa. Also, TS = 28,913/62.5 = 462.6 MPa.","To solve the problem, we need to go through several steps. These steps include calculating the engineering stress and strain values from the provided data, plotting these values to create a stress-strain curve, and then determining the yield strength, modulus of elasticity, and tensile strength. Here's how to do this step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate Engineering Stress

Engineering stress (\(\sigma\)) is defined as the force (\(F\)) applied divided by the original cross-sectional area (\(A_0\)).

\[ \sigma = \frac{F}{A_0} \]

Given:  
- The cross-sectional area (\(A_0\)) is 62.5 mm².

Using the provided data, calculate the stress for each point:

1. \( \sigma_1 = \frac{17,793 \, \text{N}}{62.5 \, \text{mm}^2} = 284.69 \, \text{MPa} \)
2. \( \sigma_2 = \frac{23,042 \, \text{N}}{62.5 \, \text{mm}^2} = 368.67 \, \text{MPa} \)
3. \( \sigma_3 = \frac{27,579 \, \text{N}}{62.5 \, \text{mm}^2} = 441.26 \, \text{MPa} \)
4. \( \sigma_4 = \frac{28,913 \, \text{N}}{62.5 \, \text{mm}^2} = 462.61 \, \text{MPa} \)
5. \( \sigma_5 = \frac{27,578 \, \text{N}}{62.5 \, \text{mm}^2} = 441.25 \, \text{MPa} \)
6. \( \sigma_6 = \frac{20,462 \, \text{N}}{62.5 \, \text{mm}^2} = 327.39 \, \text{MPa} \)

### Step 2: Calculate Engineering Strain

Engineering strain (\(\varepsilon\)) is defined as the change in length (\(\Delta L\)) divided by the original length (\(L_0\)).

\[ \varepsilon = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0} \]

Given:
- The original gage length (\(L_0\)) is 125.0 mm.

Calculate the strain for each point:

1. \( \varepsilon_1 = \frac{125.23 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.00184 \)
2. \( \varepsilon_2 = \frac{131.25 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.050 \)
3. \( \varepsilon_3 = \frac{140.05 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.1204 \)
4. \( \varepsilon_4 = \frac{147.01 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.17608 \)
5. \( \varepsilon_5 = \frac{153.00 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.224 \)
6. \( \varepsilon_6 = \frac{160.10 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.2808 \)

### Step 3: Plot the Engineering Stress-Strain Curve

Using the calculated stress and strain values, plot them on a graph with strain on the x-axis and stress on the y-axis. Connect the points to form the curve. Since I can't create visual diagrams here, you can plot it using any graph software or tool.

### Step 4: Determine the Mechanical Properties

#### (b) Yield Strength
The yield strength is typically determined by the 0.2% offset method on the stress-strain curve. This involves drawing a line parallel to the initial, linear portion of the stress-strain curve but starting at 0.002 strain. The stress at which this line intersects the curve is the yield strength. Based on the data, since the initial points are close, you would need a refined plot to identify it accurately.

#### (c) Modulus of Elasticity
The modulus of elasticity (E) is the slope of the linear portion of the stress-strain curve. You can approximate it from the initial linear segment of the curve:

\[ E \approx \frac{\Delta \sigma}{\Delta \varepsilon} \]

Using the first two points:  
\[ E \approx \frac{368.67 \, \text{MPa} - 284.69 \, \text{MPa}}{0.050 - 0.00184} \approx 1716.25 \, \text{MPa} \]

#### (d) Tensile Strength
The tensile strength is the maximum stress the material can withstand. From the data, this is the highest calculated stress:

Tensile Strength = \( \sigma_4 = 462.61 \, \text{MPa} \)

These calculations help assess the mechanical properties of the material sample during the tensile test. For accurate points, especially the yield strength, precise plotting is essential.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.03
A tensile test for a certain metal provides flow curve parameters: strain-hardening exponent is 0.3 and strength coefficient is 600 MPa. Determine (a) the flow stress at a true strain = 1.0 and (b) true strain at a flow stress = 600 MPa.,Solution: (a) Yf = 600(1.0)^.3 = 600 MPa (b) H = (600/600)^(1/.3) = (1.0)^3.33 = 1.00,"To solve the question, we'll use the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = K \epsilon^n
\]

where \( \sigma \) is the true stress, \( K \) is the strength coefficient, \( \epsilon \) is the true strain, and \( n \) is the strain-hardening exponent.

**Given:**
- \( K = 600 \, \text{MPa} \)
- \( n = 0.3 \)

**(a) Flow stress at a true strain \( \epsilon = 1.0 \)**

1. Substitute \( \epsilon = 1.0 \), \( K = 600 \, \text{MPa} \), and \( n = 0.3 \) into the equation:

   \[
   \sigma = 600 \times (1.0)^{0.3}
   \]

2. Calculate \( \sigma \):

   \[
   \sigma = 600 \times 1 = 600 \, \text{MPa}
   \]

So, the flow stress at a true strain of 1.0 is 600 MPa.

**(b) True strain at a flow stress \( \sigma = 600 \, \text{MPa} \)**

1. We are given \( \sigma = 600 \, \text{MPa} \). We need to find \( \epsilon \).

2. Using the flow curve equation and substituting the known values:

   \[
   600 = 600 \times \epsilon^{0.3}
   \]

3. Simplify:

   \[
   1 = \epsilon^{0.3}
   \]

4. Solve for \( \epsilon \) by raising both sides to the power of \( \frac{1}{0.3} \):

   \[
   \epsilon = 1^{\frac{1}{0.3}} = 1
   \]

The true strain at a flow stress of 600 MPa is 1.0.

**Conclusion:**
- The flow stress at a true strain of 1.0 is 600 MPa.
- The true strain at a flow stress of 600 MPa is 1.0.","Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.

FIGURE 3.5  True stress–strain  curve plotted on log–log scale.  

Because it is a straight line in this transformation of the data, the relationship  between true stress and true strain in the plastic region can be expressed as  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

This equation is called the  ﬂ  ow curve , and it provides a good approximation of the  behavior of metals in the plastic region, including their capacity for strain hardening.  The constant $K$  is called the  strength coefﬁ  cient , MPa  $(1{\mathrm{b}}/{\mathrm{in}}^{2}),$  and it equals the value  of true stress at a true strain value equal to one. The parameter  $n$  is called the  strain  hardening exponent , and it is the slope of the line in Figure 3.5. Its value is directly  related to a metal’s tendency to work harden. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for selected  metals are given in Table 3.4.

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine the strength coefﬁ  cient and  strain hardening exponent in the ﬂ  ow curve equation: $\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}$ .  

Solution:  We have two points on the ﬂ  ow curve from which the ﬂ  ow curve  parameters can be determined: (1) at the yield point and (2) at the maximum  load.  

(1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ . (1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ .  

Solving for $n$  and $K$ ,  

(1) $K=160/(0.001998)^{n}$  and (2) $K=375/(0.143)^{n}$   $160/(0.001998)^{n}=375/(0.143)^{n}$  

 $\ln(160)-n\ln(0.001998)=\ln(375)-n\ln(0.143$  ln(0.143)

 $5.0752-(-6.2156)n=5.9269-(-1.9449)n

$ $5.0752+6.2156n=5.9269+1.9449n

$ $(6.2156-1.9449)n=5.9269-5.0752

$ $4.2707n=0.8517$        $n=0.1994$ Substituting back into (1): $K=160/(0.001998)^{0.1994}=552.7$ .  

Check:  Using (2):  $K=375/(0.143)^{0.1994}=552.7.$  

The ﬂ  ow curve equation is $\sigma={\tt552.7}\epsilon^{\tt0.1994}$ .  

Necking in a tensile test and in metal forming operations that stretch the work  part is closely related to strain hardening. As the test specimen is elongated during  the initial part of the test (before necking begins), uniform straining occurs through- out the length because if any element in the specimen becomes strained more than  the surrounding metal, its strength increases by work hardening, thus making it  more resistant to additional strain until the surrounding metal has been strained  an equal amount. Finally, the strain becomes so large that uniform straining cannot  be sustained. A weak point in the length develops (from buildup of dislocations at  grain boundaries, impurities in the metal, or other factors), and necking is initiated,  leading to failure. Empirical evidence reveals that necking begins for a particular  metal when the true strain reaches a value equal to the strain-hardening exponent $n$ .  Therefore, a higher $n$  value means that the metal can be strained further before the  onset of necking during tensile loading.  

Types of Stress–Strain Relationships  Much information about elastic–plastic  behavior is provided by the true stress–strain curve. As indicated, Hooke’s law  ( $\mathit{(\sigma=E\epsilon)}$ ) governs the metal’s behavior in the elastic region, and the ﬂ  ow curve

(a)  Perfectly elastic . The behavior of this material is deﬁ  ned completely by its stiff- ness, indicated by the modulus of elasticity  $\mathcal{L}$ .

Given:
- \( K = 54,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \)
- \( n = 0.22 \)

### (a) Flow Stress at a True Strain = 0.45

1. **Plug in the values** into the flow curve equation:

   \[
   \sigma = 54,000 \times (0.45)^{0.22}
   \]

2. **Calculate the power of strain:**

   \[
   \sigma = 54,000 \times 0.814 \approx 43,956 \, \text{lb/in}^2

### (b) True Strain at a Flow Stress = 40,000 lb/in²

1. **Rearrange the flow curve equation to solve for strain:**

   \[
   \epsilon^n = \frac{\sigma}{K}
   \]

2. **Plug in the values:**

   \[
   \epsilon^{0.22} = \frac{40,000}{54,000} \approx 0.7407

3. **Solve for \(\epsilon\) by taking the 1/nth root:**

   \[
   \epsilon = (0.7407)^{\frac{1}{0.22}} \approx 0.352

Thus, the solutions are:
- **(a)** The flow stress at a true strain of 0.45 is approximately **43,956 lb/in²**.
- **(b)** The true strain at a flow stress of 40,000 lb/in² is approximately **0.352**.","The typical stress–strain relationship for a metal exhibits elasticity below the  yield point and strain hardening above it. Figures 3.4 and 3.5 indicate this behavior  in linear and logarithmic axes. In the plastic region, the metal’s behavior is expressed  by the ﬂ  ow curve:  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

where $K=$  the strength coefﬁ  cient, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ; and $n$  is the strain hardening expo- nent. The stress  $\sigma$  and strain  $\epsilon$  in the ﬂ  ow curve are true stress and true strain. The  ﬂ  ow curve is generally valid as a relationship that deﬁ  nes a metal’s plastic behavior  in cold working. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for different metals at room temperature  are listed in Table 3.4.  

Flow Stress  The ﬂ  ow curve describes the stress–strain relationship in the region  in which metal forming takes place. It indicates the ﬂ  ow stress of the metal—the  strength property that determines forces and power required to accomplish a par- ticular forming operation. For most metals at room temperature, the stress–strain  plot of Figure 3.5 indicates that as the metal is deformed, its strength increases  due to strain hardening. The stress required to continue deformation must be  increased to match this increase in strength.  Flow stress  is deﬁ  ned as the instan- taneous value of stress required to continue deforming the material—to keep the  metal “ﬂ  owing.” It is the yield strength of the metal as a function of strain, which  can be expressed:  

$$
Y_{f}=K\epsilon^{n}

where  $Y_{f}=$  ﬂ  ow stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ .  

In the individual forming operations discussed in the following two chapters, the  instantaneous ﬂ  ow stress can be used to analyze the process as it is occurring. For  example, in certain forging operations, the instantaneous force during compression  can be determined from the ﬂ  ow stress value. Maximum force can be calculated  based on the ﬂ  ow stress that results from the ﬁ  nal strain at the end of the forging  stroke.  

In other cases, the analysis is based on the average stresses and strains that occur  during deformation rather than instantaneous values. Extrusion represents this case,  Figure 17.2(c). As the billet is reduced in cross section to pass through the extrusion  die opening, the metal gradually strain hardens to reach a maximum value. Rather  than determine a sequence of instantaneous stress–strain values during the reduc- tion, which would be not only difﬁ  cult but also of limited interest, it is more useful to  analyze the process based on the average ﬂ  ow stress during deformation.  

Average Flow Stress  The average ﬂ  ow stress (also called the  mean ﬂ  ow stress ) is  the average value of stress over the stress–strain curve from the beginning of strain  to the ﬁ  nal (maximum) value that occurs during deformation. The value is illustrated  in the stress–strain plot of Figure 17.4. The average ﬂ  ow stress is determined by inte- grating the ﬂ  ow curve equation, Equation (17.1), between zero and the ﬁ  nal strain  value deﬁ  ning the range of interest. This yields the equation:  

$$
\overline{{Y}}_{f}=\frac{K\epsilon^{n}}{1+n}

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.

FIGURE 3.5  True stress–strain  curve plotted on log–log scale.  

Because it is a straight line in this transformation of the data, the relationship  between true stress and true strain in the plastic region can be expressed as  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

This equation is called the  ﬂ  ow curve , and it provides a good approximation of the  behavior of metals in the plastic region, including their capacity for strain hardening.  The constant $K$  is called the  strength coefﬁ  cient , MPa  $(1{\mathrm{b}}/{\mathrm{in}}^{2}),$  and it equals the value  of true stress at a true strain value equal to one. The parameter  $n$  is called the  strain  hardening exponent , and it is the slope of the line in Figure 3.5. Its value is directly  related to a metal’s tendency to work harden. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for selected  metals are given in Table 3.4.

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine the strength coefﬁ  cient and  strain hardening exponent in the ﬂ  ow curve equation: $\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}$ .  

Solution:  We have two points on the ﬂ  ow curve from which the ﬂ  ow curve  parameters can be determined: (1) at the yield point and (2) at the maximum  load.  

(1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$

"A tensile specimen is elongated to twice its original length. Determine the engineering strain and true strain for this test.

(b) To be compressed to the same true strain value (e = -0.693) the final height of the compression specimen can be determined as follows: H = -.693 = ln(Lf/Lo) Lf/Lo = exp.(-0.693) = 0.500 Therefore, Lf = 0.5 Lo","To solve the question, we need to calculate both the engineering strain and the true strain for a tensile specimen that has been elongated to twice its original length. Then, we will reverse the process to determine what the compressed length of the specimen would need to be to achieve the same strains.

### Part 1: Determine the Engineering Strain and True Strain for Tension

**Definitions:**
1. **Engineering Strain (ε):** It is defined as the change in length divided by the original length. Mathematically, it is given by:
   
   \[
   ε = \frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0}
   \]

   where \( L_f \) is the final length and \( L_0 \) is the original length.

2. **True Strain (ε_true):** It is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the final length to the original length:
   
   \[
   ε_{\text{true}} = \ln\left(\frac{L_f}{L_0}\right)
   \]

Given that the specimen is elongated to twice its original length, if \( L_0 \) is the original length, \( L_f = 2L_0 \).

**Engineering Strain Calculation:**

\[
ε = \frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{2L_0 - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{L_0}{L_0} = 1
\]

The engineering strain in tension is therefore 1 (or 100%).

**True Strain Calculation:**

\[
ε_{\text{true}} = \ln\left(\frac{L_f}{L_0}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{2L_0}{L_0}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

The true strain in tension is \(\ln(2)\).

### Part 2: Compression to Obtain Equal Strains

Now, we reverse the process to compression.

#### Part 2(a): Compressed Length for Same Engineering Strain

To achieve an engineering strain of -1 in compression, we set up the equation:

\[
ε = \frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0} = -1
\]

Solving for \( L_f \):

\[
-1 = \frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0} \implies L_f - L_0 = -L_0 \implies L_f = 0
\]

This would imply the material is compressed to a length of zero, which is not physically possible. This reflects that using engineering strain for large deformations, especially in compression, can lead to nonsensical results.

#### Part 2(b): Compressed Length for Same True Strain

For the same true strain in compression, we set:

\[
ε_{\text{true}} = \ln\left(\frac{L_f}{L_0}\right) = -\ln(2)
\]

Solving for \( L_f \):

\[
-\ln(2) = \ln\left(\frac{L_f}{L_0}\right) \implies \ln\left(\frac{L_f}{L_0}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

\[
\frac{L_f}{L_0} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Therefore:

\[
L_f = \frac{L_0}{2}
\]

The final compressed length required to achieve the same true strain as in tension is \( \frac{L_0}{2} \).

### Conclusion

- **Engineering Strain:** In tension, it is 1; in compression, achieving the same value is impossible.
- **True Strain:** In tension, it is \( \ln(2) \); in compression, to achieve \(-\ln(2)\), the length must be compressed to half of its original length. This verifies that true strain is a more reliable measure for large plastic deformations, particularly in compression scenarios.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.12
"Derive an expression for true strain as a function of D and Do for a tensile test specimen of round cross section, where D = the instantaneous diameter of the specimen and Do is its original diameter.","Solution: Starting with the definition of true strain as H = ln(L/Lo) and assuming constant volume, we have V = AoLo = AL Therefore, L/Lo = Ao/A       A =pi D^2 and Ao =pi Do^2 and A0=piD^2        Ao/A = piDo^2/piD^2 = (Do/D)2 H = ln(Do/D)2 = 2ln(Do/D)","To derive the expression for true strain in terms of the instantaneous diameter \(D\) and the original diameter \(D_o\) of a tensile test specimen of round cross section, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand True Strain Definition

True strain \(\varepsilon\) is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the instantaneous length \(L\) to the original length \(L_o\):
\[
\varepsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_o}\right)
\]

### Step 2: Relate Length to Diameter

For a specimen with a round cross-section, volume is conserved during deformation. Therefore, the original volume \(V_o\) and the instantaneous volume \(V\) can be equated:
\[
A_o \cdot L_o = A \cdot L
\]
where \(A_o\) is the original cross-sectional area and \(A\) is the instantaneous area. Express the areas in terms of their diameters:
\[
\frac{\pi}{4} D_o^2 \cdot L_o = \frac{\pi}{4} D^2 \cdot L
\]
Simplifying this equation gives:
\[
D_o^2 \cdot L_o = D^2 \cdot L
\]

### Step 3: Solve for Length Ratio

From the above equation, solve for the length ratio \(\frac{L}{L_o}\):
\[
\frac{L}{L_o} = \frac{D_o^2}{D^2}
\]

### Step 4: Substitute into True Strain Formula

Substitute the expression for \(\frac{L}{L_o}\) into the true strain definition:
\[
\varepsilon = \ln\left(\frac{D_o^2}{D^2}\right)
\]

### Step 5: Simplify the Expression

Simplify the logarithmic expression using properties of logarithms:
\[
\varepsilon = \ln\left(\left(\frac{D_o}{D}\right)^2\right) = 2 \ln\left(\frac{D_o}{D}\right)
\]

### Result

Thus, the true strain \(\varepsilon\) is expressed as:
\[
\varepsilon = 2 \ln\left(\frac{D_o}{D}\right)
\]

This expression relates the true strain to the change in diameter of a tensile test specimen of round cross section, highlighting that true strain is a logarithmic measurement of deformation considering volume conservation.","To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

metallic test specimens and the associated nonuniform effect on elongation and area  reduction.

# Example 3.1  Engineering  stress and strain  

A tensile test specimen has a starting gage length $=50\:\mathrm{mm}$  and a cross-sectional  area $=200\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ . During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}. ![](images/d9e12c60253897fff622ef840f4c9f7918425434d2680004cdc9b82d613eb271.jpg)

If pieces are  put back together as in  (6), ﬁ  nal length can be  measured.  

The load and the change in length of the specimen are recorded as testing proceeds,  to provide the data required to determine the stress–strain relationship. There are  two different types of stress–strain curves: (1) engineering stress–strain and (2) true  stress–strain. The ﬁ  rst is more important in design, and the second is more important  in manufacturing.  

Engineering Stress–strain   The engineering stress and strain in a tensile test are  deﬁ  ned relative to the original area and length of the test specimen. These values are  of interest in design because the designer expects that the strains experienced by any  component of the product will not signiﬁ  cantly change its shape. The components  are designed to withstand the anticipated stresses encountered in service.  

A typical engineering stress–strain curve from a tensile test of a metallic speci- men is illustrated in Figure 3.3. The  engineering stress  at any point on the curve is  deﬁ  ned as the force divided by the original area:  

$$
s=\frac{F}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $s=$  engineering stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ );  $F=$  applied force in the test, $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A_{o}=$  original area of the test specimen,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}$   $(\mathrm{in}^{2}]$ ). The  engineering strain  at any  point in the test is given by  

$$
e=\frac{L-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $e\:=\:$  engineering strain,  $\mathrm{mm/mm~(in/in)}$ ;  $L=$ length at any point during the  elongation, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and $L_{o}=$  original gage length, mm (in). The units of engineer- ing strain are given as $\mathrm{mm/mm}$  (in/in), but think of it as representing elongation per  unit length, without units.  

The stress–strain relationship in Figure 3.3 has two regions, indicating two dis- tinct forms of behavior: (1) elastic and (2) plastic. In the elastic region, the relation- ship between stress and strain is linear, and the material exhibits elastic behavior by  

![](images/d0bec5dc14bfbf80832d78675a36196cfd2800b33ec74d7a6c30553b276140c2.jpg)  

returning to its original length when the load (stress) is released. The relationship is  deﬁ  ned by  Hooke’s law :  

$$
s=E e
$$  

where  $E=$   modulus of elasticity  (also known as  Young’s modulus ), MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ,  a measure of the inherent stiffness of a material. It is a constant of proportionality  whose value is different for different materials. Table 3.1 presents typical values for  several materials, metals and nonmetals.  

As stress increases, some point in the linear relationship is ﬁ  nally reached at  which the material begins to yield. This  yield point   $Y$ of the material can be identi- ﬁ  ed in the ﬁ  gure by the change in slope at the end of the linear region. Because the  start of yielding is usually difﬁ  cult to see in a plot of test data (it does not usually oc- cur as an abrupt change in slope), $Y$  is typically deﬁ  ned as the stress at which a strain  offset of  $0.2\%$  from the straight line has occurred.

### Definitions

- **Engineering Strain (\( e \))**: This is the change in length (\( \Delta L \)) divided by the original length (\( L_0 \)):
  \[
  e = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0} = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{L}{L_0} - 1
  \]

- **True Strain (\( \epsilon \))**: True strain is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the final length (\( L \)) to the original length (\( L_0 \)):
  \[
  \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right)
  \]

### Derivation

1. **Start with the definition of engineering strain:**
   \[
   e = \frac{L}{L_0} - 1
   \]

2. **Rearrange the equation for \( \frac{L}{L_0} \) in terms of \( e \):**
   \[
   \frac{L}{L_0} = 1 + e
   \]

3. **Substitute \( \frac{L}{L_0} \) into the true strain formula:**
   \[
   \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right) = \ln(1 + e)
   \]

### Conclusion

Thus, we have shown that the true strain \( \epsilon \) is indeed the natural logarithm of one plus the engineering strain \( e \):
\[
\epsilon = \ln(1 + e)
\]

This equation is used to relate true strain and engineering strain, especially when strains are significant in the plastic deformation region, providing a more accurate measure of the material deformation.","In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the

previous curve, a downturn ﬁ  nally occurs as a result of necking. A dashed line is used  in the ﬁ  gure to indicate the projected continuation of the true stress–strain plot if  necking had not occurred.  

As strain becomes signiﬁ  cant in the plastic region, the values of true strain and  engineering strain diverge. True strain can be related to the corresponding engineer- ing strain by  

$$
\epsilon=\ln(1+e)
$$  

Similarly, true stress and engineering stress can be related by the expression  

$$
\sigma=s\,(1\,+\,e)
$$  

In Figure 3.4, note that stress increases continuously in the plastic region until  necking begins. When this happened in the engineering stress–strain curve, its sig- niﬁ  cance was lost because an admittedly erroneous area value was used to calculate  stress. Now when the true stress also increases, it cannot be dismissed so lightly.  What it means is that the metal is becoming stronger as strain increases. This is the  property called  strain hardening  that was mentioned in the previous chapter in the  discussion of metallic crystal structures, and it is a property that most metals exhibit  to a greater or lesser degree.  

# Example 3.2  True stress and  strain  

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine (a) true stress and (b) true strain  at the maximum load of  $65{,}000\:\mathrm{N}.$ .  

Solution:  (a) True stress is deﬁ  ned as the load divided by the instantaneous  area. To ﬁ  nd the instantaneous area, we assume uniform elongation prior to  necking. Thus, $A L=A_{o}L_{o}$ , and $A=A_{o}L_{o}/L=200(50)/57.7=173.3\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}/$  

$$
{\sigma=F/A=65,\!000/173.3=375\;\mathrm{MPa}}
$$  

(b) By Equation (3.7), true strain $\epsilon=\ln(L/L_{o})=\ln(57.7/50)=$ $\ln(1.154)={\bf0.143}$ .  

Check:  Use Equations (3.8) and (3.9) to check these values:  

Using Equation (3.8) and the value of  $e$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\epsilon=\ln(1+0.154)=0.143$ .  

Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.  

! (1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ .  

Solving for $n$  and $K$ ,  

(1) $K=160/(0.001998)^{n}$  and (2) $K=375/(0.143)^{n}$   $160/(0.001998)^{n}=375/(0.143)^{n}$  

 $\ln(160)-n\ln(0.001998)=\ln(375)-n\ln(0.143$  ln(0.143)

The ﬂ  ow curve equation is $\sigma={\tt552.7}\epsilon^{\tt0.1994}$ .  

Necking in a tensile test and in metal forming operations that stretch the work  part is closely related to strain hardening. As the test specimen is elongated during  the initial part of the test (before necking begins), uniform straining occurs through- out the length because if any element in the specimen becomes strained more than  the surrounding metal, its strength increases by work hardening, thus making it  more resistant to additional strain until the surrounding metal has been strained  an equal amount. Finally, the strain becomes so large that uniform straining cannot  be sustained. A weak point in the length develops (from buildup of dislocations at  grain boundaries, impurities in the metal, or other factors), and necking is initiated,  leading to failure. Empirical evidence reveals that necking begins for a particular  metal when the true strain reaches a value equal to the strain-hardening exponent $n$ .  Therefore, a higher $n$  value means that the metal can be strained further before the  onset of necking during tensile loading.  

Types of Stress–Strain Relationships  Much information about elastic–plastic  behavior is provided by the true stress–strain curve. As indicated, Hooke’s law  ( $\mathit{(\sigma=E\epsilon)}$ ) governs the metal’s behavior in the elastic region, and the ﬂ  ow curve

A copper wire of diameter 0.80 mm fails at an engineering stress = 248.2 MPa. Its ductility is measured as 75% reduction of area. Determine the true stress and true strain at failure.,"Solution: Area reduction AR = (Ao -Af)/Ao = 0.75 Ao -Af = 0.75 Ao    Ao -0.75Ao = 0.25 Ao = Af      If engineering stress = 248.2 MPa, then true stress V = 248.2/0.25 = 992.8 MPa True strain H = ln(Lf/Lo) = ln(Ao/Af) = ln(4) = 1.386.  However, it should be noted that these values are associated with the necked portion of the test specimen.","To solve this problem, we need to determine the true stress and true strain at failure using the given data for the copper wire. Let's go through it step by step.

### Given Data
- Diameter of wire \( d = 0.80 \, \text{mm} \)
- Engineering stress \(\sigma_e = 248.2 \, \text{MPa}\)
- Ductility \(( AR ) = 75\% \) reduction of area

### Step-by-Step Solution

**1. Calculate the Initial Cross-Sectional Area (\(A_o\)):**

The initial area is calculated using the diameter:
\[
A_o = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} = \frac{\pi (0.80)^2}{4} = 0.5024 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

**2. Find the Final Cross-Sectional Area (\(A_f\)):**

Given the area reduction (ductility) of 75%:
\[
AR = \frac{A_o - A_f}{A_o} = 0.75
\]
\[
A_f = A_o (1 - AR) = 0.5024 \, \text{mm}^2 \times (1 - 0.75) = 0.1256 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

**3. Calculate the True Stress (\(\sigma_t\)):**

True stress is the load divided by the instantaneous area at failure.
\[
\sigma_t = \frac{F}{A_f}
\]

First, find the force using engineering stress:
\[
F = \sigma_e \times A_o = 248.2 \, \text{MPa} \times 0.5024 \, \text{mm}^2 = 124.69648 \, \text{N}
\]

Now calculate true stress:
\[
\sigma_t = \frac{124.69648 \, \text{N}}{0.1256 \, \text{mm}^2} = 992.72 \, \text{MPa}
\]

**4. Calculate the True Strain (\(\epsilon_t\)):**

True strain is calculated using the logarithmic formula for strain.
\[
\epsilon_t = \ln{\frac{A_o}{A_f}} = \ln{\frac{0.5024}{0.1256}} = \ln{4} \approx 1.386
\]

### Results
- **True Stress at Failure:** \( \sigma_t = 992.72 \, \text{MPa} \)
- **True Strain at Failure:** \( \epsilon_t \approx 1.386 \)

These calculations show the true stress and strain at the point of failure, reflecting more accurate conditions than engineering stress and strain by accounting for changes in cross-sectional area.","During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}.

 (c) Tensile strength $=$  maximum load divided by original area: 

 ${\cal T}S=65{,}000/200=325~\mathrm{M}\mathrm{Pa}$ .

 (d) By Equation (3.2), engineering strain at maximum load  $e=$  

 $(57.7-50)/50={\bf0.154}$ .

 (e) Deﬁ  ned in Equation (3.4), percent elongation $E L=(59.5-50)/50=$

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the  

! To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

### Given:
- Original gage length, \( L_0 = 2.0 \, \text{in} \)
- Cross-sectional area, \( A_0 = 0.5 \, \text{in}^2 \)
- Maximum load, \( F = 37,000 \, \text{lb} \)
- Elongation at maximum load = 24%

### Determine True Stress (\(\sigma\)):

1. **Convert Elongation to Final Length:**
   \[
   L_{\text{max}} = L_0 \times (1 + \text{Elongation})
   \]
   \[
   L_{\text{max}} = 2.0 \, \text{in} \times (1 + 0.24) = 2.48 \, \text{in}

2. **Calculate Engineering Stress:**
   \[

   \]

3. **Calculate True Stress:**
   - Since we're at maximum load just before necking, assume negligible change in area:
   \[
   A \approx A_0 = 0.5 \, \text{in}^2
   \]
   \[
   \sigma = \frac{F}{A} = 74,000 \, \text{psi}

### Determine True Strain (\(\epsilon\)):

1. **Use True Strain Formula:**
   \[
   \epsilon = \ln \left(\frac{L_{\text{max}}}{L_0}\right)
   \]
   \[
   \epsilon = \ln \left(\frac{2.48}{2.0}\right) = \ln(1.24) \approx 0.216

- **True Stress:** \( 74,000 \, \text{psi} \)
- **True Strain:** \( 0.216 \)

"A metal alloy has been tested in a tensile test with the following results for the flow curve parameters: strength coefficient = 620.5 MPa and strain-hardening exponent = 0.26. The same metal is now tested in a compression test in which the starting height of the specimen = 62.5 mm and its diameter = 25 mm. Assuming that the cross section increases uniformly, determine the load required to compress the specimen to a height of (a) 50 mm ","Solution: Starting volume of test specimen V = pi*hDo^ 2/4 = 62.5pi(25)^2/4 = 30679.6 mm3.

The flow curve equation for true stress (\(\sigma\)) and true strain (\(\epsilon\)) is given by:

\[
\sigma = K \cdot \epsilon^n
\]

where:
- \( K \) is the strength coefficient (620.5 MPa),
- \( n \) is the strain-hardening exponent (0.26).

### Steps for Solution:

1. **Calculate the Initial Volume of the Specimen:**
   - The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
     \[
     V = \pi \cdot \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 \cdot h
     \]
   - Initial volume (\( V_0 \)) with diameter \( d = 25 \) mm and initial height \( h_0 = 62.5 \) mm:
     \[
     V_0 = \pi \cdot \left(\frac{25}{2}\right)^2 \cdot 62.5 \approx 30625 \, \text{mm}^3
     \]

2. **Determine the Final Volume of the Specimen:**
   - As the specimen is being compressed, its volume remains constant (assuming no material is lost). So, \( V_{\text{final}} = V_0 \).

3. **Calculate the Final Radius After Compression:**
   - The final height \( h_f = 50 \) mm. Using the volume conservation principle:
     \[
     V_0 = \pi \cdot r_f^2 \cdot h_f
     \]
     \[
     30625 = \pi \cdot r_f^2 \cdot 50
     \]
     \[
     r_f^2 = \frac{30625}{\pi \cdot 50} \approx 195.25
     \]
     \[
     r_f = \sqrt{195.25} \approx 13.97 \, \text{mm}
     \]
   - The diameter (\( d_f \)) after compression is twice the radius:
     \[
     d_f = 2 \cdot 13.97 \approx 27.94 \, \text{mm}
     \]

4. **Calculate True Strain:**
   - True strain (\(\epsilon\)) for compression is calculated using:
     \[
     \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{h_0}{h_f}\right)
     \]
     \[
     \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{62.5}{50}\right) = \ln(1.25) \approx 0.223
     \]

5. **Calculate True Stress:**
   - Substitute the true strain into the flow curve equation:
     \[
     \sigma = 620.5 \cdot (0.223)^{0.26}

The problem provides us with the strength coefficient (K) and the strain-hardening exponent (n) from the tensile test, and we need to apply these to a compression test scenario. Here's how we solve it step by step:

### Given:
- Strength coefficient, \( K = 620.5 \) MPa  
- Strain-hardening exponent, \( n = 0.26 \)
- Initial height of the specimen, \( h_0 = 62.5 \) mm
- Initial diameter of the specimen, \( d_0 = 25 \) mm
- Final height of the specimen after compression, \( h_f = 37.5 \) mm

### Steps:

1. **Calculate Initial Volume:**
   The volume of the cylindrical specimen remains constant during the compression, assuming no material is lost and deformation is uniform. The initial volume \( V_0 \) is:
   \[
   V_0 = \pi \times \left(\frac{d_0}{2}\right)^2 \times h_0
   \]
   \[
   V_0 = \pi \times \left(\frac{25}{2}\right)^2 \times 62.5 \text{ mm}^3
   \]
   \[
   V_0 = \pi \times 12.5^2 \times 62.5 \text{ mm}^3
   \]
   \[
   V_0 = 30,664.5 \text{ mm}^3
   \]

2. **Calculate Final Diameter:**
   Since the volume is conserved, \( V_0 = V_f \), where \( V_f \) is the final volume.
   \[
   V_f = \pi \times \left(\frac{d_f}{2}\right)^2 \times h_f
   \]
   Equating \( V_0 \) and \( V_f \), solve for \( d_f \):
   \[
   \pi \times 12.5^2 \times 62.5 = \pi \times \left(\frac{d_f}{2}\right)^2 \times 37.5
   \]
   \[
   \left(\frac{d_f}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{30,664.5}{37.5}
   \]
   \[
   \left(\frac{d_f}{2}\right)^2 = 818.12
   \]
   \[
   \frac{d_f}{2} = \sqrt{818.12} \approx 28.6 \text{ mm}
   \]
   \[
   d_f = 2 \times 28.6 \approx 57.2 \text{ mm}
   \]

3. **Calculate True Strain \( \epsilon \):**
   True strain \( \epsilon \) in compression is given by:
   \[
   \epsilon = \ln \left(\frac{h_0}{h_f}\right)
   \]
   \[
   \epsilon = \ln \left(\frac{62.5}{37.5}\right)
   \]
   \[
   \epsilon = \ln (1.6667) \approx 0.5108
   \]

4. **Determine True Stress Using the Flow Curve Equation:**
   The flow curve is defined by the equation:
   \[
   \sigma = K \times \epsilon^n
   \]
   Substitute the known values:
   \[
   \sigma = 620.5 \times (0.5108)^{0.26}
   \]
   \[
   \sigma \approx 620.5 \times 0.798 \approx 495.5 \text{ MPa}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Load \( F \):**
   The load can be calculated by multiplying the true stress by the final cross-sectional area \( A_f \):
   \[
   A_f = \pi \times \left(\frac{d_f}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \times (28.6)^2
   \]
   \[
   A_f \approx 2,570.57 \text{ mm}^2
   \]
   \[
   F = \sigma \times A_f
   \]
   \[
   F = 495.5 \times 2,570.57 \text{ N}
   \]
   \[
   F \approx 1.273 \times 10^6 \text{ N} \text{ or } 1273 \text{ kN}

"A steel test specimen (modulus of elasticity = 30 x 106 lb/in2) in a compression test has a starting height = 2.0 in and diameter = 1.5 in. The metal yields (0.2% offset) at a load = 140,000 lb. At a load of 260,000 lb, the height has been reduced to 1.6 in. Determine (a) yield strength.","Solution: (a) Starting volume of test specimen V = h*pi*D2/4 = 2(1.5)^2/4 = 3.534 in3. Ao = Do/4 = (1.5)^2/4 = 1.767 in2 Y = 140,000/1.767 = 79,224 lb/in2","To determine the yield strength of the steel test specimen, we'll proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the Initial Cross-Sectional Area
The specimen is a cylinder, so its initial cross-sectional area \( A_0 \) can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle:

\[
A_0 = \pi \left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^2
\]

where \( d \) is the diameter of the specimen.

Given:
- \( d = 1.5 \) inches

\[
A_0 = \pi \left( \frac{1.5}{2} \right)^2 = \pi \times (0.75)^2 = \pi \times 0.5625
\]

Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \),

\[
A_0 \approx 3.1416 \times 0.5625 \approx 1.7671 \text{ in}^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Yield Strength
Yield strength is defined as the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically. The 0.2% offset method is commonly used to determine this. However, for the immediate calculation, the yield strength \( \sigma_y \) can be estimated using:

\[
\sigma_y = \frac{F_y}{A_0}
\]

where \( F_y \) is the yield load (force).

Given:
- \( F_y = 140,000 \) lb (yield load)

Substitute the known values:

\[
\sigma_y = \frac{140,000}{1.7671} \text{ lb/in}^2
\]

\[
\sigma_y \approx 79,204.6 \text{ lb/in}^2
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion
Thus, the yield strength of the steel test specimen is approximately \( 79,204.6 \) lb/in².

Note: The method described uses simple calculation assuming that the offset yield is well represented by working directly with yield load and does not involve the 0.2% offset curve construction, which is a more detailed process requiring stress-strain data points.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.2

- Transverse rupture strength (TRS) = 1000 MPa
- Width (\( b \)) = 15 mm
- Thickness (\( t \)) = 10 mm
- Length between supports (\( L \)) = 60 mm

1. **Rearrange the TRS formula to solve for \( F \):**

   \[
   F = \frac{T R S \cdot b \cdot t^2}{1.5 \cdot L}

2. **Substitute the given values into the formula:**

   - \( T R S = 1000 \) MPa = \( 1000 \times 10^6 \) N/m² (since 1 MPa = \( 10^6 \) N/m²)
   - Convert the dimensions from mm to m for consistency in units:
     - \( b = 0.015 \) m
     - \( t = 0.010 \) m

   \[
   F = \frac{(1000 \times 10^6) \times 0.015 \times (0.010)^2}{1.5 \times 0.060}

   \[
   F = \frac{(1000 \times 10^6) \times 0.015 \times 0.0001}{0.09}

Failure usually occurs because the ultimate tensile strength of the  outer ﬁ  bers of the specimen has been exceeded. This results in  cleavage , a failure  mode associated with ceramics and metals operating at low service temperatures,  in which separation rather than slip occurs along certain crystallographic planes.  The strength value derived from this test is called the  transverse rupture strength ,  calculated from the formula

The ﬂ  exure test is also used for certain nonbrittle materials such as thermoplastic  polymers. In this case, because the material is likely to deform rather than fracture,  TRS cannot be determined based on failure of the specimen. Instead, either of two  measures is used: (1) the load recorded at a given level of deﬂ  ection, or (2) the de- ﬂ  ection observed at a given load.  

# 3.1.4 SHEAR PROPERTIES  

Shear involves application of stresses in opposite directions on either side of a thin  element to deﬂ  ect it as shown in Figure 3.11. The shear stress is deﬁ  ned as

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12. As torque  is increased, the tube deﬂ  ects by twisting, which is a shear strain for this geometry. To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as

### Given Data:
- Radius \( R = 25 \, \text{mm} \)
- Wall thickness \( t = 3 \, \text{mm} \)
- Gauge length \( L = 50 \, \text{mm} \)
- Applied torque \( T = 900 \, \text{N-m} = 900,000 \, \text{N-mm} \)

\]

Substitute the values:

\[

These calculations give us the shear stress and shear strain for the torsion test specimen based on the provided data.","Shear strain can be deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\gamma=\frac{\delta}{b}
$$  

where  $\gamma=$  shear strain, $\mathrm{mm/mm}\;(\mathrm{in/in});\delta=$ the deﬂ  ection of the element, mm (in);  and $b=$  the orthogonal distance over which deﬂ  ection occurs, mm (in).  

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12. As torque  is increased, the tube deﬂ  ects by twisting, which is a shear strain for this geometry. The shear stress can be determined in the test by the equation  

$$
\tau=\frac{T}{2\pi R^{2}t}
$$  

where  $T=$  applied torque,  $\mathrm{N{-mm}}$  (lb-in);  $R\,=$ radius of the tube measured to the  neutral axis of the wall, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and $t=$  wall thickness, mm (in). The shear strain can  be determined by measuring the amount of angular deﬂ  ection of the tube, convert- ing this into a distance deﬂ  ected, and dividing by the gauge length  $L$ . Reducing this  to a simple expression,  

$$
\gamma={\frac{R\alpha}{L}}
$$  

where  $\upalpha=$  the angular deﬂ  ection (radians).  

A typical shear stress–strain curve is shown in Figure 3.13. In the elastic region,  the relationship is deﬁ  ned by

where  $G\,=$  the  shear modulus , or  shear modulus of elasticity , MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ . For  most materials, the shear modulus can be approximated by  $G=0.4E$ , where  $E$  is the  conventional elastic modulus.  

In the plastic region of the shear stress–strain curve, the material strain hardens  to cause the applied torque to continue to increase until fracture ﬁ  nally   occurs.  The relationship in this region is similar to the ﬂ  ow curve. The shear stress at  fracture can be calculated and this is used as the  shear strength $S$  of the material.  Shear strength can be estimated from tensile strength data by the approximation:  $S=0.7(T S)$ .  

Because the cross-sectional area of the test specimen in the torsion test does not  change as it does in the tensile and compression tests, the engineering stress–strain  curve for shear derived from the torsion test is virtually the same as the true stress– strain curve.  

Shear processes are common in industry. Shearing action is used to cut sheet metal  in blanking, punching, and other cutting operations (Section 19.1). In machining, the  material is removed by the mechanism of shear deformation (Section 20.2).  

The hardness of a material is deﬁ  ned as its resistance to permanent indentation.  Good hardness generally means that the material is resistant to scratching and wear.  For many engineering applications, including most of the tooling used in manufac- turing, scratch and wear resistance are important characteristics. As the reader shall  see later in this section, there is a strong correlation between hardness and strength.  

3.2.1  HARDNESS TESTS  

Hardness tests are commonly used for assessing material properties because they  are quick and convenient. However, a variety of testing methods are appropriate  because of differences in hardness among different materials. The best-known hard- ness tests are Brinell and Rockwell. During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}.

$ (b) Subtracting the $0.2\%$  offset, engineering strain  $e=(50.2-50.0)/50.0\;-

$ $0.002=0.002$ Rearranging Equation (3.3), modulus of elasticity  $E=s/e=160/0.002=$  

 $\mathbf{80,000\,M P a}$ .

 (c) Tensile strength $=$  maximum load divided by original area: 

 ${\cal T}S=65{,}000/200=325~\mathrm{M}\mathrm{Pa}$ .

 (d) By Equation (3.2), engineering strain at maximum load  $e=$  

 $(57.7-50)/50={\bf0.154}$ .

 (e) Deﬁ  ned in Equation (3.4), percent elongation $E L=(59.5-50)/50=$  

 $\mathbf{0.19}=\mathbf{19\%}$ .  

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation.

load. These materials do not respond well to traditional tensile testing because of  problems in preparing the test specimens and possible misalignment of the press  jaws that hold the specimen. The  bending test  (also known as the  ﬂ  exure test ) is  used to test the strength of these materials, using a setup illustrated in the ﬁ  rst  diagram in Figure 3.10. In this procedure, a specimen of rectangular cross section  is positioned between two supports, and a load is applied at its center. In this con- ﬁ  guration, the test is called a three-point bending test. A four-point conﬁ  guration  is also sometimes used. These brittle materials do not ﬂ  ex to the exaggerated ex- tent shown in Figure 3.10; instead they deform elastically until immediately be- fore fracture. Failure usually occurs because the ultimate tensile strength of the  outer ﬁ  bers of the specimen has been exceeded. This results in  cleavage , a failure  mode associated with ceramics and metals operating at low service temperatures,  in which separation rather than slip occurs along certain crystallographic planes.  The strength value derived from this test is called the  transverse rupture strength ,  calculated from the formula  

$$
T R S={\frac{1.5F L}{b t^{2}}}
$$  

where  $T R S=$  transverse rupture strength, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  applied load at fracture,  N (lb); $L=$ length of the specimen between supports, mm (in); and  $b$  and  $t$  are the  dimensions of the cross section of the specimen as shown in the ﬁ  gure, mm (in).  

The ﬂ  exure test is also used for certain nonbrittle materials such as thermoplastic  polymers. In this case, because the material is likely to deform rather than fracture,  TRS cannot be determined based on failure of the specimen. Instead, either of two  measures is used: (1) the load recorded at a given level of deﬂ  ection, or (2) the de- ﬂ  ection observed at a given load.

For a tested hardness of HB = 182, TS = 500(182) = 91,000 lb/in2.","To solve this, let's break down the steps for calculating the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN) and then estimating the tensile strength.

### Step (a): Determine the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN)

**Formula for Brinell Hardness Number (BHN):**

\[
BHN = \frac{2P}{\pi D (D - \sqrt{D^2 - d^2})}
\]

Where:
- \( P \) = load applied (in kilograms-force), which we need to convert to newtons: \( 1500 \, \text{kg} \times 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 14715 \, \text{N} \).
- \( D \) = diameter of the indenter ball, which is 10 mm.
- \( d \) = diameter of the indentation, which is 3.2 mm.

Substitute the given values into the formula:

1. **Convert the input units as needed:**  
   - \( P = 1500 \, \text{kg} \times 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 14715 \, \text{N} \).

2. **Calculate the term \( \sqrt{D^2 - d^2} \):**  
   - \( D^2 = (10)^2 = 100 \).
   - \( d^2 = (3.2)^2 = 10.24 \).
   - \( D^2 - d^2 = 100 - 10.24 = 89.76 \).
   - \( \sqrt{89.76} \approx 9.48 \).

3. **Calculate \( BHN \) using the formula:**

\[
BHN = \frac{2 \times 14715}{\pi \times 10 \times (10 - 9.48)}
\]

\[
BHN = \frac{29430}{3.1416 \times 10 \times 0.52}
\]

\[
BHN = \frac{29430}{16.328}
\]

\[
BHN \approx 1802.43
\]

### Step (b): Estimate the Tensile Strength of Steel

**Empirical relation between BHN and tensile strength for steel:**

A common empirical correlation is:

\[
\text{Tensile Strength (MPa)} = BHN \times 3.45
\]

Substitute the BHN calculated:

\[
\text{Tensile Strength} = 180.43 \times 3.45 = 622 MPa
\]

Not all hardness tests are based on the applied load divided by area, but many of them are. (b) Some of the other hardness tests and operating principles include: (1) Rockwell hardness test, which measures the depth of indentation of a cone resulting from an applied load; (2) Scleroscope, which measures the rebound height of a hammer dropped from a certain distance against a surface specimen; and (3) Durometer, which measures elastic deformation by pressing an indentor into the surface of rubber and similar soft materials.","To address the question regarding the inspector's claim about hardness tests, we need to analyze each part of the statement and clarify the principles behind different hardness tests. We'll break down the question step by step.

### Part (a): Is the inspector correct?

The inspector's claim is that all hardness tests are based on the same principle as the Brinell test, specifically that hardness is measured as the applied load divided by the area of the impressions made by an indentor.

**Brinell Hardness Test:**
- In the Brinell test, hardness is indeed measured as the applied load divided by the surface area of the indentation. This is calculated using a spherical indenter (typically a hardened steel or carbide ball) that is pressed into the material under a specified load.
- Formula: \( HB = \frac{2P}{\pi D(D - \sqrt{D^2 - d^2})} \)
  - \( P \) = applied load
  - \( D \) = diameter of the indenter
  - \( d \) = diameter of the indentation

**Rockwell Hardness Test:**
- In the Rockwell test, the principle is slightly different. Rather than dividing the applied load by the area of indentation, the Rockwell test measures the depth of penetration under a major load beyond a preliminary minor load (often noted as preload).
- The Rockwell hardness number (HR) is given directly by the depth of penetration, which is translated into a hardness scale. Different scales (e.g., HRA, HRB, HRC) are used depending on the indenter material and load combinations.

**Conclusion for (a):**
- The inspector is incorrect in claiming that all hardness tests, including the Rockwell test, are based on the same principle as the Brinell test, i.e., dividing load by the area of indentation.
  
### Part (b): What are some of the other principles involved in hardness testing, and what are the associated tests?

1. **Vickers Hardness Test:**
   - Similar in principle to Brinell, but uses a diamond pyramid-shaped indenter with a square base.
   - Measures hardness as applied load divided by the surface area of the indentation.
   - Formula: \( HV = \frac{1.854 P}{d^2} \), where \( d \) is the average diagonal length of the indentation.

2. **Knoop Hardness Test:**
   - Uses an elongated diamond indenter and is more suitable for brittle materials and thin sheets.
   - The load is applied, and the size of the indentation is measured along its long diagonal.
   - Formula: \( HK = \frac{14.229 P}{L^2} \), where \( L \) is the length of the indentation.

3. **Microhardness Testing:**
   - Variations of Vickers or Knoop tests that use lower loads and are suitable for small/thin samples or coatings.

4. **Shore Hardness Test:**
   - Used mainly for polymers and elastomers. Measures rebound height of a dropped hammer on the material.
   - Provides a qualitative measure of hardness rather than a mathematically precise hardness number.

**Conclusion for (b):**
- Besides Brinell, hardness tests can be based on depth measurement (Rockwell) or other geometrically influenced load measurements, like in Vickers, Knoop, and Shore tests.

"A batch of annealed steel has just been received from the vendor. It is supposed to have a tensile strength in the range 60,000 -70,000 lb/in2. A Brinell hardness test in the receiving department yields a value of HB = 118. (a) Does the steel meet the specification on tensile strength?","Solution: (a) TS = 500(HB) = 500(118) = 59,000 lb/in2. This lies outside the specified range of 60,000 to 70,000 lb/in2. However, from a legal standpoint, it is unlikely that the batch can be rejected on the basis of its measured Brinell hardness number without using an actual tensile test to measure TS. The formula for converting from Brinell hardness number to tensile strength is only an approximating equation. ","To determine if the steel meets the specified tensile strength range of 60,000 - 70,000 lb/in², we can use the empirical relationship between Brinell hardness (HB) and tensile strength, which is common in the metallurgy and manufacturing industry.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

#### Step 1: Understand the Conversion Formula
An empirical formula often used to approximate the tensile strength (\( \sigma \)) based on Brinell hardness (HB) is:

\[ \sigma = K \times HB \]

where:
- \( \sigma \) is the tensile strength in lb/in²,
- HB is the Brinell hardness,
- \( K \) is a constant that varies depending on the type of steel.

#### Step 2: Determine the Constant \( K \)
For many steels, a common approximation for \( K \) is 500. However, this can vary slightly based on the specific composition and treatment of the steel. Let's use \( K = 500 \) as a typical value.

#### Step 3: Calculate the Tensile Strength
Using the formula with \( K = 500 \):

\[ \sigma = 500 \times 118 \]

\[ \sigma = 59,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \]

#### Step 4: Compare to Specification
Now, compare the calculated tensile strength to the specification range:

- Calculated tensile strength: 59,000 lb/in²
- Specification range: 60,000 - 70,000 lb/in²

#### Step 5: Conclusion
Since 59,000 lb/in² is less than the specified minimum tensile strength of 60,000 lb/in², the annealed steel does **not** meet the specification on tensile strength. The receiving batch falls short by 1,000 lb/in² based on this empirical conversion.

#### Note:
It's important to remember that these conversions are approximations. For precise quality assessments, it might be necessary to perform direct tensile strength testing rather than relying solely on hardness tests. Additionally, confirm the empirical constant \( K \) with the specific type of steel being used, as variations may occur.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.27
"A batch of annealed steel has just been received from the vendor. It is supposed to have a tensile strength in the range 60,000 -70,000 lb/in2. A Brinell hardness test in the receiving department yields a value of HB = 118. (b) Estimate the yield strength of the material.","Solution:  (b) Based on Table 3.2 in the text, the ratio of Y to TS for low carbon steel = 25,000/45,000 =0.555. Using this ratio, we can estimate the yield strength to be Y = 0.555(59,000) = 32,700 lb/in2.","To estimate the yield strength of the annealed steel given its Brinell hardness value (HB = 118), we can use empirical correlations that relate Brinell hardness numbers to material properties like yield strength and tensile strength. In general, there are established formulas which correlate Brinell hardness (HB) to yield strength and tensile strength for steel.

One common empirical formula for estimating the tensile strength (\( \sigma_t \)) is:
\[ \sigma_t = C \cdot HB \]
where \( C \) is a constant that often ranges from 450 to 500 for steels. However, note that tensile strength differs from yield strength.

For yield strength (\( \sigma_y \)) estimation, we can use another empirical correlation:
\[ \sigma_y \approx 0.5 \cdot \sigma_t \]

Given, the Brinell hardness number (HB) is 118, and assuming \( C = 500 \) for generalized middle-carbon steels, let's calculate:

1. **Estimate the tensile strength:**
   \[
   \sigma_t = C \cdot HB = 500 \times 118 = 59,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2
   \]

2. **Estimate the yield strength:**
   While the typical linear relation like the tensile strength to Brinell hardness exists, yield can vary. From empirical correlation:
   \[
   \sigma_y \approx 0.5 \cdot \sigma_t = 0.5 \times 59,000 = 29,500 \, \text{lb/in}^2
   \]

### Explanation
- **Step 1:** Applied an empirical formula for tensile strength. In practice, tensile strength is roughly \( HB \times 500 \) for medium carbon steel.
- **Step 2:** Calculated the yield strength using approximately half the tensile strength, a commonly used engineering estimate for steel where yield strength is around 50% of tensile strength.

Therefore, the estimated yield strength of the material is approximately \( 29,500 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \), which is typical for steels with a Brinell hardness of 118 in this context.

"Two flat plates, separated by a space of 4 mm, are moving relative to each other at a velocity of 5 m/sec. The space between them is occupied by a fluid of unknown viscosity. The motion of the plates is resisted by a shear stress of 10 Pa due to the viscosity of the fluid. Assuming that the velocity gradient of the fluid is constant, determine the coefficient of viscosity of the fluid.",Solution: Shear rate = (5 m/s x 1000 mm/m)/(4 mm) = 1250 s-1 K = (10N/m2)/(1250 s-1) = 0.008 N-s/m2 = 0.008 Pa-s,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the coefficient of viscosity (\(\eta\)) of the fluid between the two plates. The relevant concept here is Newton's law of viscosity, which relates shear stress, velocity gradient, and viscosity. The law is given by:

\[
\tau = \eta \cdot \frac{du}{dy}
\]

Where:
- \(\tau\) is the shear stress (in Pascals, Pa).
- \(\eta\) is the coefficient of viscosity (in Pascal-seconds, Pa·s).
- \(\frac{du}{dy}\) is the velocity gradient (in \(\text{m/s}^2\)).

### Given:
- Shear stress, \(\tau = 10 \, \text{Pa}\)
- Velocity of the moving plate, \(u = 5 \, \text{m/s}\)
- Distance between the plates, \(dy = 4 \, \text{mm} = 0.004 \, \text{m}\)

### Calculation Steps:

1. **Determine the Velocity Gradient (\(\frac{du}{dy}\)):**

   The velocity gradient is the change in velocity with respect to distance, which in this case is the change across the gap between the two plates.

   \[
   \frac{du}{dy} = \frac{u}{dy} = \frac{5 \, \text{m/s}}{0.004 \, \text{m}}
   \]

   \[
   \frac{du}{dy} = 1250 \, \text{m/s}^2
   \]

2. **Apply Newton's Law of Viscosity to Solve for \(\eta\):**

   Rearrange the formula to solve for the coefficient of viscosity:

   \[
   \eta = \frac{\tau}{\frac{du}{dy}}
   \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**

   \[
   \eta = \frac{10 \, \text{Pa}}{1250 \, \text{m/s}^2}
   \]

   \[
   \eta = 0.008 \, \text{Pa·s}
   \]

### Conclusion:

The coefficient of viscosity of the fluid is \(0.008 \, \text{Pa·s}\). This calculation is based on the assumption of a constant velocity gradient, meaning the flow between the plates is linear, which is typical for a Newtonian fluid under simple conditions like this one.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.28
"Two parallel surfaces, separated by a space of 0.5 in that is occupied by a fluid, are moving relative to each other at a velocity of 25 in/sec. The motion is resisted by a shear stress of 0.3 lb/in2 due to the viscosity of the fluid. If the velocity gradient in the space between the surfaces is constant, determine the viscosity of the fluid.",Solution: Shear rate = (25 in/sec)/(0.5 in) = 50 sec-1 K = (0.3 lb/in2)/(50 sec-1) = 0.0006 lb-sec/in2.,"To determine the viscosity of the fluid, we can use the fundamental relationship between shear stress (\(\tau\)), viscosity (\(\mu\)), and the velocity gradient in a fluid. This relationship is often described by Newton's Law of Viscosity, which states:

\[
\tau = \mu \cdot \left(\frac{du}{dy}\right)
\]

Where:
- \(\tau\) is the shear stress,
- \(\mu\) is the dynamic viscosity,
- \(\frac{du}{dy}\) is the velocity gradient perpendicular to the direction of shear.

### Given Data:
- Shear stress (\(\tau\)) = 0.3 lb/in²
- Velocity of the moving surface = 25 in/sec
- Distance between the two surfaces (\(dy\)) = 0.5 in

Since the velocity gradient is constant, and knowing that one surface is moving while the other is stationary, the velocity gradient (\(\frac{du}{dy}\)) can be calculated as:

\[
\frac{du}{dy} = \frac{\text{Change in velocity}}{\text{Distance between surfaces}} = \frac{25\, \text{in/sec}}{0.5\, \text{in}}
\]

Calculate the velocity gradient:

\[
\frac{du}{dy} = \frac{25}{0.5} = 50\, \text{sec}^{-1}
\]

Now, rearrange the equation for Newton's Law of Viscosity to solve for the viscosity (\(\mu\)):

\[
\mu = \frac{\tau}{\frac{du}{dy}}
\]

Substitute the known values into the equation:

\[
\mu = \frac{0.3\, \text{lb/in}^2}{50\, \text{sec}^{-1}}
\]

Calculate the viscosity:

\[
\mu = 0.006\, \text{lb}\cdot\text{s}/\text{in}^2
\]

### Conclusion:
The viscosity of the fluid is \(0.006\, \text{lb}\cdot\text{s}/\text{in}^2\).

A 125.0-mm-diameter shaft rotates inside a stationary bushing whose inside diameter = 125.6 mm and length = 50.0 mm. In the clearance between the shaft and the bushing is a lubricating oil whose viscosity = 0.14 Pa-s. The shaft rotates at a velocity of 400 rev/min; this speed and the action of the oil are sufficient to keep the shaft centered inside the bushing. Determine the magnitude of the torque due to viscosity that acts to resist the rotation of the shaft.,Solution: Bushing internal bearing area A = (125.6)^2 x 50/4 = 19729.6 mm2 = 19729.2(10^-6) m2 d = (125.6 -125)/2 = 0.3 mm v = (125pi mm/rev)(400 rev/min)(1 min/60 sec) = 2618.0 mm/s Shear rate = 2618/0.3 = 8726.6 s-1     W = (0.14)(8726.6) = 1221.7 Pa = 1221.7 N/mm2 Force on surface between shaft and bushing = (1221.7 N/mm2)(19729.2(10^-6)) = 24.1 N Torque T = 24.1 N x 125/2 mm = 1506.4 N-mm = 1.506 N-m,"To solve this problem, we will determine the torque due to the viscosity of the lubricating oil between the rotating shaft and the stationary bushing. Here's a step-by-step approach to calculate the torque:

### Step 1: Understand the physical scenario

- We have a cylindrical shaft rotating inside a bushing.
- The diameter of the shaft is 125.0 mm.
- The inside diameter of the bushing is 125.6 mm.
- The length of the bushing is 50.0 mm.
- There is a layer of lubricating oil in the clearance between the shaft and the bushing.
- The viscosity of the oil is given as 0.14 Pa-s.
- The shaft rotates at 400 revolutions per minute (rev/min).

### Step 2: Calculate the radial clearance

The radial clearance between the shaft and the bushing is the difference between their radii:

\[
\text{Radial clearance} = \frac{(125.6 \, \text{mm} - 125.0 \, \text{mm})}{2} = 0.3 \, \text{mm} = 0.0003 \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 3: Convert the rotational speed to radians per second

The shaft rotates at 400 rev/min, which needs to be converted to radians per second:

\[
\omega = 400 \, \text{rev/min} \times \frac{2\pi \, \text{rad/rev}}{60 \, \text{s/min}} = \frac{400 \times 2\pi}{60} \, \text{rad/s} \approx 41.89 \, \text{rad/s}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the linear velocity at the surface of the shaft

The surface velocity \( V \) of the shaft is given by:

\[
V = \omega \times \frac{d}{2} = 41.89 \, \text{rad/s} \times \frac{0.125 \, \text{m}}{2} = 2.618 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the shear stress due to viscosity

Shear stress (\(\tau\)) in the clearance due to viscosity is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\eta \times V}{c},
\]

where \(\eta = 0.14 \, \text{Pa-s}\) and \(c = 0.0003 \, \text{m}\):

\[
\tau = \frac{0.14 \times 2.618}{0.0003} = 1221.47 \, \text{Pa}.
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the resisting torque

The torque due to viscosity (\(T\)) acts over the surface area of the bushing \( A = \pi \times d \times L \):

\[
A = \pi \times 0.125 \, \text{m} \times 0.050 \, \text{m} = 0.01963 \, \text{m}^2.
\]

The resisting force \( F \) is given by:

\[
F = \tau \times A = 1221.47 \times 0.01963 = 23.968 \, \text{N}.
\]

The torque \( T \) is the force applied at the radius of the shaft:

\[
T = F \times \frac{d}{2} = 23.968 \times \frac{0.125}{2} = 1.496 \, \text{N-m}.
\]

Therefore, the magnitude of the torque due to viscosity that acts to resist the rotation of the shaft is approximately 1.496 N-m.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.3

For precise operations like this, it's common to use the linear thermal expansion/contraction formula. Since we need to deal with contraction, the formula helps us predict how much a material's dimensions will change in response to temperature changes.

### Formula for Linear Thermal Expansion/Contraction:
\[ \Delta L = L_0 \times \alpha \times \Delta T \]

Where:
- \( \Delta L \) is the change in length (or diameter, in this case).
- \( L_0 \) is the original length (or original diameter).
- \( \alpha \) is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion.
- \( \Delta T \) is the change in temperature (final temperature - initial temperature).

### Steps to Solve the Problem:

**Step 1: Define known values:**
- \( L_0 = 25.00 \) mm (initial diameter)
- \( \Delta L = 24.98 \) mm - 25.00 mm = -0.02 mm (needed change in diameter, negative because it is a reduction)
- Initial temperature (room temperature) = 20°C

**Step 2: Obtain material data:**
- We need the coefficient of linear thermal expansion (\( \alpha \)) for the material of the shaft. Since the specific table (Table 4.1) is not provided, generally, for steel, a common value of \( \alpha \) is around \( 11 \times 10^{-6} \text{ per °C} \).

**Step 3: Plug values into the formula and solve for \( \Delta T \):**

\[ \Delta L = L_0 \times \alpha \times \Delta T \]

Rearranging for \( \Delta T \):

\[ \Delta T = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0 \times \alpha} \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ \Delta T = \frac{-0.02 \, \text{mm}}{25.00 \, \text{mm} \times 11 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{per °C}} \]

\[ \Delta T = \frac{-0.02}{0.000275} \]

\[ \Delta T \approx -72.73 \, \text{°C} \]

**Step 4: Determine the new temperature:**
- \( \Delta T \) indicates how much the temperature should decrease.
- New Temperature = Initial Temperature + \( \Delta T \)
- New Temperature = 20°C - 72.73°C

### Final Result:
New Temperature ≈ -52.73°C

The density of a material decreases as its temperature increases due to the expansion of the material.

**Steps:**

1. **Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE):**
   - Assume the coefficient of thermal expansion for aluminum is approximately \(22.2 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{°C}^{-1}\).

2. **Initial Density and Volume:**
   - Initial density at 20°C: \(\rho_0 = 2.70 \, \text{g/cm}^3\).
   - Initial volume \(V_0\) can be assumed as 1 cm\(^3\) for simplicity.

3. **Temperature Change:**
   - \(\Delta T = 650 - 20 = 630 \, \text{°C}\).

4. **Volume Expansion Calculation:**
   - The volume changes according to the formula:
   \[
   V = V_0 (1 + \beta \Delta T)
   \]
   - For isotropic materials, \(\beta \approx 3 \times \text{CTE}\).
   \[
   \beta = 3 \times 22.2 \times 10^{-6} = 66.6 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{°C}^{-1}

   V \approx 1 \times (1 + 0.041958)
   \]
   \[
   V \approx 1.041958 \, \text{cm}^3

5. **Calculate the New Density:**
   - Density is mass over volume. Assuming mass remains constant:
   \[
   \rho = \frac{\text{mass}}{V} = \frac{\rho_0 \times V_0}{V} = \frac{2.70}{1.041958}

   \[
   \rho \approx 2.59 \, \text{g/cm}^3

The density of aluminum at 650°C is approximately \(2.59 \, \text{g/cm}^3\).","# TABLE  •  6.1   (continued): (f) Titanium.

as an ore because of its higher Ti content. In recovery of the metal from its ores, the  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  is converted to titanium tetrachloride  $\mathrm{(TiCl_{4})}$  by reacting the compound with  chlorine gas. This is followed by a sequence of distillation steps to remove impurities.  The  highly concentrated  $\mathrm{TiCl_{4}}$  is then reduced to metallic titanium by reaction with  magnesium; this is known as the  Kroll process . Sodium can also be used as a reduc-  ing agent. In either case, an inert atmosphere must be maintained to prevent $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ , $\mathbf{N}_{2}$ ,  or $\mathrm{H}_{2}$  from contaminating the Ti, owing to its chemical affinity for these gases. The  resulting metal is used to cast ingots of titanium and its alloys.  

Properties of Titanium  Ti’s coefficient of thermal expansion is relatively low  among metals. It is stiffer and stronger than aluminum, and it retains good strength  at elevated temperatures. Pure titanium is reactive, which presents problems in  processing, especially in the molten state. However, at room temperature it forms  a thin adherent oxide coating $\left(\mathrm{TiO}_{2}\right)$  that provides excellent corrosion resistance.  

These properties give rise to two principal application areas for titanium: (1) in  the commercially pure state, Ti is used for corrosion resistant components, such as  marine components and prosthetic implants; and (2) titanium alloys are used as  high-strength components in temperatures ranging from ambient to above  $550^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ $(1000^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ), especially where its excellent strength-to-weight ratio is exploited.

Aluminum Production  The principal aluminum ore is  bauxite , which consists  largely of hydrated aluminum oxide  $(\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}–\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O})$ ) and other oxides. Extraction of  the aluminum from bauxite can be summarized in three steps: (1) washing and  crushing the ore into fine powders; (2) the Bayer process, in which the bauxite is  converted to pure alumina  $\left(\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$ ; and (3) electrolysis, in which the alumina is  separated into aluminum and oxygen gas  $(\mathrm{O}_{2})$ . The  Bayer process , named after the  German chemist who developed it, involves solution of bauxite powders in aque-  ous caustic soda (NaOH) under pressure, followed by precipitation of pure $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ from solution. Alumina is commercially important in its own right as an engineering  ceramic (Chapter 7).

"With reference to Table 4.1, determine the increase in length of a steel bar whose length = 10.0 in, if the bar is heated from room temperature of 70F to 500F.",Solution: Increase = (6.7 x 10^-6 in/in/F)(10.0 in)(500F -70F) = 0.0288 in.,"To calculate the increase in length of a steel bar when it is heated from 70°F to 500°F, given the initial length of 10.0 inches, we'll use the formula for thermal expansion:

\[
L_{2} - L_{1} = a L_{1} (T_{2} - T_{1})
\]

### Steps:

1. **Identify the Values:**
   - Initial length \( L_{1} = 10.0 \) inches
   - Initial temperature \( T_{1} = 70°F \)
   - Final temperature \( T_{2} = 500°F \)
   - Coefficient of thermal expansion for steel, \( a = 6.5 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{in/in/°F} \) (This is a typical value; you may need to refer to a specific table for precise applications).

2. **Calculate Temperature Difference:**
   \[
   \Delta T = T_{2} - T_{1} = 500°F - 70°F = 430°F
   \]

3. **Calculate Length Change:**
   Use the formula for thermal expansion to find the change in length.

   \[
   \Delta L = a L_{1} \Delta T
   \]

   Plug in the values:

   \[
   \Delta L = (6.5 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{in/in/°F}) \times 10.0 \, \text{in} \times 430°F
   \]

   \[
   \Delta L = 6.5 \times 10^{-6} \times 10.0 \times 430
   \]

   \[
   \Delta L = 0.02795 \, \text{inches}
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   The increase in length of the steel bar when heated from 70°F to 500°F is approximately \(0.02795\) inches.","The change in  length corresponding to a given temperature change is given by:  

$$
L_{2}-L_{1}=a L_{1}\left(T_{2}-T_{1}\right)
$$  

where $a=$   coefficient of thermal expansion, $^{\circ}\mathbf{C}^{\cdot1}(^{\circ}\mathbf{F}^{\cdot1})$ ; and $L_{1}$  and $L_{2}$  are lengths,  mm (in), corresponding, respectively, to temperatures $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2},\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\ (^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ .  

Values of coefficient of thermal expansion given in Table 4.1 suggest that it has  a linear relationship with temperature. This is only an approximation. Not only is  length affected by temperature, but the thermal expansion coefficient itself is also  affected. For some materials it increases with temperature; for other materials it  decreases. These changes are usually not significant enough to be of much concern,  and values like those in the table are quite useful in design calculations for the range  of temperatures contemplated in service. Changes in the coefficient are more sub-  stantial when the metal undergoes a phase transformation, such as from solid to  liquid, or from one crystal structure to another.  

In manufacturing operations, thermal expansion is put to good use in shrink fit  and expansion fit assemblies (Section 31.3), in which a part is heated to increase its  size or cooled to decrease its size to permit insertion into some other part. When the  part returns to ambient temperature, a tightly fitted assembly is obtained. Thermal  expansion can be a problem in heat treatment (Chapter 26) and welding (Section  29.6) because of thermal stresses that develop in the material during these processes.  

# 4.1.3  MELTING  CHARACTERISTICS  

For a pure element, the  melting point $T_{m}$   is the temperature at which the mate- rial  transforms from solid to liquid state. The reverse transformation, from liquid to  solid,  occurs at the same temperature and is called the  freezing point . For crystalline  elements,  such as metals, the melting and freezing temperatures are the same. A cer- tain  amount of heat energy, called the  heat of fusion , is required at this temperature to  accomplish the transformation from solid to liquid.  

Melting of a metal element at a specific temperature assumes equilibrium condi-  tions. Exceptions occur in nature; for example, when a molten metal is cooled, it may  remain in the liquid state below its freezing point if nucleation of crystals does not  initiate immediately. When this happens, the liquid is said to be  supercooled .  

There are other variations in the melting process—differences in the way melt-  ing occurs in different materials. For example, unlike pure metals, most metal alloys  do not have a single melting point. Instead, melting begins at a certain temperature,   called the  solidus , and continues as   the temperature increases until finally convert-  ing completely to the liquid state at a temperature called the  liquidus . Between the  two temperatures, the alloy is a mixture of solid and molten metals, the amounts of  each being inversely proportional to their relative distances from the liquidus and  solidus. Although most alloys behave in this way, exceptions are eutectic alloys that  

FIGURE 4.1  Changes  in volume per unit  weight (1/density) as a  function of temperature  for a hypothetical pure  metal, alloy, and glass;  all exhibiting similar  thermal expansion and  melting  characteristics.

melt (and freeze) at a single temperature. These issues are examined in the discus-  sion of phase diagrams in Chapter 6.  

Another difference in melting occurs with noncrystalline materials (glasses). In  these materials, there is a gradual transition from solid to liquid states. The solid  material gradually softens as temperature increases, finally becoming liquid at the  melting point. During softening, the material has a consistency of increasing plasticity  (increasingly like a fluid) as it gets closer to the melting point.  

These differences in melting characteristics among pure metals, alloys, and glass  are portrayed in Figure 4.1. These assembly methods are used to ﬁ  t gears, pulleys, sleeves,  and other components onto solid and hollow shafts.  

Various methods are used to heat and/or cool the work parts. Heating equip- ment includes torches, furnaces, electric resistance heaters, and electric induction  heaters. Cooling methods include conventional refrigeration, packing in dry ice,  and immersion in cold liquids, including liquid nitrogen. The resulting change in  diameter depends on the coefﬁ  cient of thermal expansion and the temperature  difference that is applied to the part. If it is assumed that the heating or cooling  has produced a uniform temperature throughout the work, then the change in di- ameter is given by  

$$
D_{2}\!-\!D_{1}=\alpha\,D_{1}(T_{2}\!-\!T_{1})
$$  

where $\alpha=$  the coefﬁ  cient of linear thermal expansion, $\mathrm{mm/mm\cdot^{\circ}C}$  (in/in- $\mathrm{\cdot^{\circ}F}$ ) for the  material (see Table 4.1);  $T_{2}=$  the temperature to which the parts have been heated  or cooled, $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $\mathrm{(^{\circ}F)}$ ;  $T_{1}=$  starting ambient temperature;  $D_{2}=$  diameter of the part at  $T_{2},\mathrm{mm}$ $D_{\scriptscriptstyle1}=$  diameter of the part at  $T_{1}$ .  

Equations (31.5) through (31.9) for computing interference pressures and  effective stresses can be used to determine the corresponding values for shrink and  expansion ﬁ  ts.  

# Example 31.2  Expansion ﬁ  t  

An alloy steel shaft is to be inserted into a collar of the same metal using an  expansion ﬁ  t. At room temperature  $(20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ , the outer and inner diameters  of the collar $=50.00\:\mathrm{mm}$  and  $30.00\:\mathrm{mm}$ , respectively, and the shaft has a  diameter  $=30.015\:\mathrm{mm}$ . The shaft must be reduced in size for assembly into  the collar by cooling to a sufﬁ  ciently low temperature that there is a  clearance of  $0.03\;\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) the temperature to which the shaft  must be cooled for assembly, (b) the radial pressure at room temperature  after assembly, and (c) the maximum effective stress on the collar.

### Step 1: Determine the Volume

The aluminum block is 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, which makes its volume:

\[
V = 10 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} = 1000 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

### Step 2: Find the Density

The density of aluminum is approximately \(2.7 \, \text{g/cm}^3\).

### Step 3: Calculate the Mass

Mass \((m)\) is the product of density \((\rho)\) and volume \((V)\):

\[
m = \rho \times V = 2.7 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \times 1000 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2700 \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 4: Find the Specific Heat Capacity

The specific heat capacity \(C_s\) of aluminum in its solid form is approximately \(0.897 \, \text{J/g°C}\).

### Step 5: Calculate the Temperature Change

The initial temperature \(T_o\) is 21°C, and the final temperature \(T_f\) is 300°C. The temperature change \((\Delta T)\) is:

\[
\Delta T = T_f - T_o = 300^\circ\text{C} - 21^\circ\text{C} = 279^\circ\text{C}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the Heat Energy Required

The formula for heat energy required is:

\[
Q = m \times C_s \times \Delta T
\]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[
Q = 2700 \, \text{g} \times 0.897 \, \text{J/g°C} \times 279^\circ\text{C} = 676,209.3 \, \text{J}
\]

### Conclusion

The quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of the aluminum block from 21°C to 300°C is approximately \(676,209.3 \, \text{J}\).","In permanent metal molds, small vent holes are drilled into the mold or  machined into the parting line to permit removal of air and gases.  

#  Heating and Pouring  

To perform a casting operation, the metal must be heated to a temperature some- what above its melting point and then poured into the mold cavity to solidify. Several  aspects of these two steps are discussed in this section.  

# 10.2.1  HEATING THE METAL  

Heating furnaces of various kinds (Section 11.4.1) are used to heat the metal to a  molten temperature sufﬁ  cient for casting. The heat energy required is the sum of (1)  the heat to raise the temperature to the melting point, (2) the heat of fusion to con- vert it from solid to liquid, and (3) the heat to raise the molten metal to the desired  temperature for pouring. This can be expressed:  

$$
H=\rho\,V\{C_{s}\,(T_{m}-\,T_{o})+\,H_{f}+\,C_{l}\,(T_{p}\,-\,T_{m})\}
$$  

where  $H=$  total heat required to raise the temperature of the metal to the pour- ing temperature, J (Btu); $\rho=$  density,  $\mathrm{{g}/\mathrm{{cm}}^{3}}$   $\left(1\mathrm{b}\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{in}^{3}\right)$ ;  $C_{s}=$  weight speciﬁ  c heat for  the solid metal,  $\mathrm{J/g-C}$  (Btu/lbm-F);  $T_{m}=$  melting temperature of the metal, C (F);  $T_{o}=$  starting temperature—usually ambient,  $\mathrm{C}$  (F);  $H_{f}=$  heat of fusion,  $\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{g}$  ( $\mathrm{{'Bup/}}$ lbm);  $C_{1}=$  weight speciﬁ  c heat of the liquid metal, $\mathrm{J/g-C}$  (Btu/lbm-F);  $T_{p}=$  pouring  temperature, C (F); and  $V=$  volume of metal being heated, $\mathrm{cm}^{3}\left(\mathrm{in}^{3}\right)$ .  

# Example 10.1  Heating metal  for casting  

One cubic meter of a certain eutectic alloy is heated in a crucible from room  temperature to $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  above its melting point for casting. The alloy’s density $=$ $7.5\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , melting point $=800^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , speciﬁ  c heat $=0.33\;\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{g}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  in the solid state  and $0.29\,\mathrm{J/g^{\circ}C}$  in the liquid state; and heat of fusion $=160\,\mathrm{J/g}$ . How much heat  energy must be added to accomplish the heating, assuming no losses?  

Solution :  Assume ambient temperature in the foundry $=25^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and that the  density of the liquid and solid states of the metal are the same. Noting that one  $\mathsf{m}^{3}=10^{6}\,\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , and substituting the property values into Equation (10.1),  

$H=(7.5)\,(10^{6})\{0.33(800-25)+160+0.29\,(100)\}=3335(10^{6})\,\mathrm{J}$ The above equation is of conceptual value, but its computational value is limited,  

notwithstanding the calculation in Example 10.1. Use of Equation (10.1) is com- plicated by the following factors: (1) Speciﬁ  c heat and other thermal properties of  a solid metal vary with temperature, especially if the metal undergoes a change of  phase during heating. (2) A metal’s speciﬁ  c heat may be different in the solid and  liquid states. Noting that one  $\mathsf{m}^{3}=10^{6}\,\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , and substituting the property values into Equation (10.1),  

$H=(7.5)\,(10^{6})\{0.33(800-25)+160+0.29\,(100)\}=3335(10^{6})\,\mathrm{J}$ The above equation is of conceptual value, but its computational value is limited,

Use of Equation (10.1) is com- plicated by the following factors: (1) Speciﬁ  c heat and other thermal properties of  a solid metal vary with temperature, especially if the metal undergoes a change of  phase during heating. (2) A metal’s speciﬁ  c heat may be different in the solid and  liquid states. (3) Most casting metals are alloys, and most alloys melt over a tem- perature range between a solidus and liquidus rather than at a single melting point;  thus, the heat of fusion cannot be applied so simply as indicated above. (4) The  property values required in the equation for a particular alloy are not readily avail- able in most cases. (5) There are signiﬁ  cant heat losses to the environment during  heating.  

# 10.2.2  POURING THE MOLTEN METAL  

After heating, the metal is ready for pouring. Introduction of molten metal into the  mold, including its ﬂ  ow through the gating system and into the cavity, is a critical  step in the casting process. For this step to be successful, the metal must ﬂ  ow into  all regions of the mold before solidifying. Factors affecting the pouring operation  include pouring temperature, pouring rate, and turbulence.  

The  pouring temperature  is the temperature of the molten metal as it is intro- duced into the mold. What is important here is the difference between the tempera- ture at pouring and the temperature at which freezing begins (the melting point for  a pure metal or the liquidus temperature for an alloy). This temperature difference is  sometimes referred to as the  superheat . This term is also used for the amount of heat  that must be removed from the molten metal between pouring and when solidiﬁ  ca- tion commences [7].  

Pouring rate  refers to the volumetric rate at which the molten metal is poured  into the mold. If the rate is too slow, the metal will chill and freeze before ﬁ  lling the  cavity. If the pouring rate is excessive, turbulence can become a serious problem.  Turbulence  in ﬂ  uid ﬂ  ow is characterized by erratic variations in the magnitude and  direction of the velocity throughout the ﬂ  uid. The ﬂ  ow is agitated and irregular  rather than smooth and streamlined, as in laminar ﬂ  ow. Turbulent ﬂ  ow should be  avoided during pouring for several reasons. It tends to accelerate the formation  of metal oxides that can become entrapped during solidiﬁ  cation, thus degrading  the quality of the casting. Turbulence also aggravates  mold erosion , the gradual  wearing away of the mold surfaces due to impact of the ﬂ  owing molten metal.  The densities of most molten metals are much higher than water and other ﬂ  uids  normally encountered. These molten metals are also much more chemically reac- tive than at room temperature. Consequently, the wear caused by the ﬂ  ow of these  metals in the mold is signiﬁ  cant, especially under turbulent conditions. Erosion is  especially serious when it occurs in the main cavity because the geometry of the  cast part is affected.  

# 10.2.3  ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF POURING  

There are several relationships that govern the ﬂ  ow of liquid metal through  the gating system and into the mold. An important relationship is  Bernoulli’s  theorem , which states that the sum of the energies (head, pressure, kinetic, and  friction) at any two points in a ﬂ  owing liquid are equal.

What is the resistance R of a length of copper wire whose length = 10 m and whose diameter = 0.10 mm? Use Table 4.3 as a reference.,"Solution: R = rL/A, A = pi(0.1)^2/4 = 0.007854 mm2 = 0.007854(10^-6) m2 From Table 4.3, r = 1.7 x 10^-8 -m2/m  R = (1.7 x 10^-8  ohm-m2/m)(10 m)/( 0.007854(10^-6) m2) = 2164.5(10^-2) : = 21.65 ohm","To determine the resistance \( R \) of a copper wire, we use the formula for electrical resistance:

\[ R = \rho \frac{L}{A} \]

where:
- \( \rho \) is the resistivity of the material (for copper, \(\rho \approx 1.68 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m}\)),
- \( L \) is the length of the wire (10 meters in this case),
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the wire.

**Step 1: Calculate the Cross-sectional Area \( A \).**

The wire's diameter is given as 0.10 mm, which we convert to meters for consistency:
\[ \text{Diameter} = 0.10 \, \text{mm} = 0.10 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} = 1.0 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m} \]

The formula for the area of a circle is:
\[ A = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 \]

Substituting the diameter:
\[ A = \pi \left(\frac{1.0 \times 10^{-4}}{2}\right)^2 \]
\[ A = \pi \left(5.0 \times 10^{-5}\right)^2 \]
\[ A = \pi \times 25.0 \times 10^{-10} \]
\[ A = 78.5 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}^2 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the Resistance \( R \).**

Now, substitute the values into the resistance formula:
\[ R = \rho \frac{L}{A} \]
\[ R = (1.68 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m}) \frac{10 \, \text{m}}{78.5 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}^2} \]
\[ R = (1.68 \times 10^{-8}) \times \frac{10}{78.5 \times 10^{-10}} \]
\[ R = 1.68 \times 10^{-7} \times \frac{1}{78.5 \times 10^{-10}} \]
\[ R = 1.68 \times 10^{-7} \times 1.274 \times 10^{9} \]
\[ R = 2.14 \, \Omega \]

Therefore, the resistance \( R \) of the copper wire is approximately \( 2.14 \, \Omega \).","This can be expressed  by the equation

FIGURE 29.12  Resistance welding  (RW), showing the  components in  spot welding, the  predominant process in  the RW group.  

The current used in resistance welding operations is very high (5000–20,000 A,  typically), although voltage is relatively low (usually below  $10\,\mathrm{V}$ ). The duration $t$  of  the current is short in most processes, perhaps lasting 0.1 to  $0.4~\mathrm{s}$  in a typical spot- welding operation.  

The reason why such a high current is used in RW is because (1) the squared term  in Equation (29.3) ampliﬁ  es the effect of current, and (2) the resistance is very low  (around  $0.0001\;\Omega$ ). Resistance in the welding circuit is the sum of (1) resistance of  the electrodes, (2) resistances of the work parts, (3) contact resistances between elec- trodes and work parts, and (4) contact resistance of the faying surfaces. Thus, heat  is generated in all of these regions of electrical resistance. The ideal situation is for  the faying surfaces to be the largest resistance in the sum, because this is the desired  location of the weld. The resistance of the electrodes is minimized by using metals  with very low resistivities, such as copper. Also, the electrodes are often water cooled  to dissipate the heat that is generated there. The work part resistances are a function  of the resistivities of the base metals and the part thicknesses. The contact resist- ances between the electrodes and the parts are determined by the contact areas (i.e.,  size and shape of the electrode) and the condition of the surfaces (e.g., cleanliness  of the work surfaces and scale on the electrode). Finally, the resistance at the faying  surfaces depends on surface ﬁ  nish, cleanliness, contact area, and pressure. No paint,  oil, dirt, or other contaminants should be present to separate the contacting surfaces.  

# Example 29.2  Resistance  welding  

A resistance spot-welding operation performed on two pieces of $2.5\mathrm{-mm}$ -thick  sheet steel uses 12,000 amps for a 0.20-s duration. The electrodes are  $6\,\mathrm{mm}$  in  diameter at the contacting surfaces. Resistance is assumed to be $0.0001\;\Omega$ , and  the resulting weld nugget $6\:\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter and averages $3\:\mathrm{mm}$  in thickness.  The unit melting energy for the metal  $U_{m}=12.0\:\mathrm{J/mm}^{3}$ . What portion of the  heat generated was used to form the weld nugget, and what portion was dis- sipated into the work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air?  

Solution:   The heat generated in the operation is given by Equation (29.3) as.  

$$
H=(12,\!000)^{2}(0.0001)(0.2)=2880\,\mathrm{J}
$$  

The volume of the weld nugget (assumed disc-shaped) is  $\nu=3.0\frac{\pi(6)^{2}}{4}=$ $84.8\;\mathrm{mm}^{3}$ .  

The heat required to melt this volume of metal is  $H w=84.8(12.0)=\mathbf{1018\,J}$ .   The remaining heat,  $\begin{array}{r}{2880{-}1018=1862\;\mathbf{J}}\end{array}$   $(64.7\%$  of the total), is lost into the  work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air. In effect, this loss represents  the combined effect of the heat transfer factor $f_{1}$  and melting factor $f_{2}$   (Section 28.3.2). The heat required to melt this volume of metal is  $H w=84.8(12.0)=\mathbf{1018\,J}$ .   The remaining heat,  $\begin{array}{r}{2880{-}1018=1862\;\mathbf{J}}\end{array}$   $(64.7\%$  of the total), is lost into the  work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air. In effect, this loss represents  the combined effect of the heat transfer factor $f_{1}$  and melting factor $f_{2}$   (Section 28.3.2).  

Success in resistance welding depends on pressure as well as heat. The principal  functions of pressure in RW are to (1) force contact between the electrodes and  the work parts and between the two work surfaces prior to applying current, and  (2) press the faying surfaces together to accomplish coalescence when the proper  welding temperature has been reached.  

General advantages of resistance welding include (1) no ﬁ  ller metal is re- quired, (2) high production rates are possible, (3) lends itself to mechanization and  automation, (4) operator skill level is lower than that required for arc welding, and  (5) good repeatability and reliability. Drawbacks are (1) equipment cost is high— usually much higher than most arc-welding operations, and (2) types of joints that  can be welded are limited to lap joints for most RW processes.  

# 29.2.2  RESISTANCE-WELDING PROCESSES  

The resistance-welding processes of most commercial importance are spot, seam,  and projection welding.  

Resistance Spot Welding  Resistance spot welding is by far the predominant  process in this group. It is widely used in mass production of automobiles, appliances,  metal furniture, and other products made of sheet metal. If one considers that a  typical car body has approximately 10,000 individual spot welds, and that the annual  production of automobiles throughout the world is measured in tens of millions of  units, the economic importance of resistance spot welding can be appreciated.  

Resistance spot welding  (RSW) is an RW process in which fusion of the faying  surfaces of a lap joint is achieved at one location by opposing electrodes. The process  is used to join sheet-metal parts of thickness  $3~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.125 in) or less, using a series  of spot welds, in situations where an airtight assembly is not required. The size and  shape of the weld spot is determined by the electrode tip, the most common elec- trode shape being round, but hexagonal, square, and other shapes are also used. The  resulting weld nugget is typically 5 to  $10\;\mathrm{mm}\;(0.2–0.4\;\mathrm{in})$  in diameter, with a heat- affected zone extending slightly beyond the nugget into the base metals. If the weld  is made properly, its strength will be comparable to that of the surrounding metal.  The steps in a spot welding cycle are depicted in Figure 29.13.

The sequence is: (1)  parts inserted between  open electrodes, (2)  electrodes close and  force is applied, (3)  weld time—current is  switched on, (4) cur- rent is turned off but  force is maintained or  increased (a reduced  current is sometimes  applied near the end of  this step for stress re- lief in the weld region),  and (5) electrodes are  opened, and the welded  assembly is removed.

Materials used for RSW electrodes consist of two main groups: (1) copper-based  alloys and (2) refractory metal compositions such as copper and tungsten combina- tions. The second group is noted for superior wear resistance. As in most manufactur- ing processes, the tooling in spot welding gradually wears out as it is used.

Since nickel is a metal, the resistivity would increase, causing the resistance to increase. This, in turn, would cause slightly more heat to be generated.","To solve the problem of calculating the resistance of a 16 gage nickel wire and understanding how current affects its resistance, we need to go through the following steps:

### Part (a): Calculate the Resistance of the Wire

1. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - Wire diameter: 0.0508 inches
   - Wire length: 32.8 feet
   - Material: Nickel
   - We're missing ""Table 4.3"" in the question context, but for the purpose of calculation, assume nickel resistivity (\(\rho\)) is approximately \(6.99 \times 10^{-7} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m}\).

2. **Convert Units:**
   - Convert the length from feet to meters:
     \[
     32.8 \, \text{ft} \times 0.3048 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{ft}} \approx 9.99744 \, \text{m}
     \]
   - Convert the diameter from inches to meters:
     \[
     0.0508 \, \text{in} \times 0.0254 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{in}} = 0.00128932 \, \text{m}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Cross-Sectional Area of the Wire:**
   - Using the formula for the area \(A\) of a circle (\(A = \pi r^2\)) where \(r = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2}\):
     \[
     r = \frac{0.00128932}{2} \approx 0.00064466 \, \text{m}
     \]
     \[
     A = \pi \times (0.00064466)^2 \approx 1.304 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2
     \]

4. **Calculate the Resistance:**
   - Use the resistance formula \(R = \rho \frac{L}{A}\):
     \[
     R = 6.99 \times 10^{-7} \Omega\cdot\text{m} \times \frac{9.99744}{1.304 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 5.362 \, \Omega
     \]

### Part (b): Effect of Current on Resistance

1. **Understand the Impact of Temperature on Resistance:**
   - When a current flows through a wire, it generates heat (Joule heating) due to the wire's resistance.
   - The resistivity (\(\rho\)) of most conductors, including nickel, increases with temperature.

2. **Temperature Coefficient of Resistance:**
   - The change in resistance with temperature is given by:
     \[
     R_t = R_0 [1 + \alpha (T - T_0)]
     \]
     Where:
     - \(R_t\) is the resistance at temperature \(T\).
     - \(R_0\) is the initial resistance (calculated as 5.362 Ω).
     - \(\alpha\) is the temperature coefficient of resistivity (for nickel, it's approximately 0.006 per °C).
     - \(T_0\) is the initial temperature in °C.
     - \(T\) is the final temperature in °C.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - As the wire heats up due to the current, the resistance will increase because of the positive temperature coefficient of nickel.
   - The extent of this increase depends on the specific current and resulting temperature rise.

By following these procedures you can calculate the resistance of the wire and understand the temperature dependency of nickel's resistivity effectively.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,4.0,4.7

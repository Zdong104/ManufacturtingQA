" A tensile test uses a test specimen that has a gage length of 50 mm and an area = 200 mm2. During the test the specimen yields under a load of 98,000 N. The corresponding gage length = 50.23 mm. 
This is the 0.2 percent yield point. The maximum load of 168,000 N is reached at a gage length = 
64.2 mm. D. Determine (a) yield strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, and (c) tensile strength. ","Solution: (a) Y = 98,000/200 = 490 MPa. (b) s = E e Subtracting the 0.2% offset, e = (50.23 -50.0)/50.0 -0.002 = 0.0026 E = s/e = 490/0.0026 = 188.5 x 103 MPa.  (c) TS = 168,000/200 = 840 MPa.  ","To solve the problem, we'll need to calculate three key parameters in the context of a tensile test: (a) Yield Strength, (b) Modulus of Elasticity, and (c) Tensile Strength. We'll base our calculations on the given data.

### Given Data:
- Initial gage length, \(L_0 = 50 \, \text{mm}\)
- Cross-sectional area, \(A = 200 \, \text{mm}^2\)
- Yield load, \(F_y = 98,000 \, \text{N}\)
- Gage length at yield, \(L_y = 50.23 \, \text{mm}\)
- Maximum load, \(F_\text{max} = 168,000 \, \text{N}\)
- Gage length at maximum load, \(L_\text{max} = 64.2 \, \text{mm}\)

### (a) Yield Strength:
Yield strength is the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically. It can be calculated using the yield load divided by the original cross-sectional area.

\[
\sigma_y = \frac{F_y}{A}
\]
\[
\sigma_y = \frac{98,000 \, \text{N}}{200 \, \text{mm}^2} = 490 \, \text{N/mm}^2
\]

### (b) Modulus of Elasticity:
Modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus) is determined by the ratio of stress to strain in the linear elastic region of the stress-strain curve. Strain (\(\epsilon\)) can be calculated between the initial and yield gage length.

Strain at yield:
\[
\epsilon_y = \frac{L_y - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{50.23 \, \text{mm} - 50 \, \text{mm}}{50 \, \text{mm}} = 0.0046
\]

When the yield load is reached, the stress is the yield strength calculated above. Therefore,
\[
E = \frac{\sigma_y}{\epsilon_y} = \frac{490 \, \text{N/mm}^2}{0.0046} = 106,522 \, \text{N/mm}^2
\]

### (c) Tensile Strength:
Tensile strength is the maximum stress that a material can withstand while being stretched or pulled before failing or breaking. It is calculated using the maximum load divided by the original cross-sectional area.

\[
\sigma_\text{tensile} = \frac{F_\text{max}}{A}
\]
\[
\sigma_\text{tensile} = \frac{168,000 \, \text{N}}{200 \, \text{mm}^2} = 840 \, \text{N/mm}^2
\]

### Final Answers:
- (a) Yield Strength: \( 490 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \)
- (b) Modulus of Elasticity: \( 106,522 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \)
- (c) Tensile Strength: \( 840 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \)",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.01
"A test specimen in a tensile test has a gage length of 2.0 in and an area = 0.5 in2. During the test the specimen yields under a load of 32,000 lb. The corresponding gage length = 2.0083 in. This is the 0.2 percent yield point. The maximum load of 60,000 lb is reached at a gage length = 2.60 in. Determine (a) yield strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, and (c) tensile strength. (d) If fracture occurs at a gage length of 2.92 in, determine the percent elongation. (e) If the specimen necked to an area = 0.25 in2, determine the percent reduction in area.","Solution: (a) Y = 32,000/0.5 = 64,000 lb/in2 (b) s = E e Subtracting the 0.2% offset, e = (2.0083 -2.0)/2.0 -0.002 = 0.00215 E = s/e = 64,000/0.00215 = 29.77 x 106 lb/in2  (c) TS = 60,000/0.5 = 120,000 lb/in2  (d) EL = (2.92 -2.0)/2.0 = 0.92/2.0 = 0.46 = 46%  (e) AR = (0.5 -0.25)/0.5 = 0.50 = 50%","To solve this problem, we will calculate each parameter step by step.

### (a) Yield Strength

Yield strength (\(\sigma_y\)) is calculated using the formula:

\[
\sigma_y = \frac{\text{Load at Yield Point}}{\text{Original Cross-sectional Area}}
\]

Given:
- Load at Yield Point = 32,000 lb
- Original Cross-sectional Area = 0.5 in\(^2\)

\[
\sigma_y = \frac{32,000 \text{ lb}}{0.5 \text{ in}^2} = 64,000 \text{ psi}
\]

### (b) Modulus of Elasticity

The elastic modulus \(E\) can be estimated using the formula:

\[
E = \frac{\sigma_y}{\varepsilon_y}
\]

Where:
- \(\varepsilon_y\) (strain at yield point) = \(\frac{\text{Change in Length at Yield}}{\text{Original Gage Length}}\)

The change in length at yield = 2.0083 in - 2.0 in = 0.0083 in.

\[
\varepsilon_y = \frac{0.0083 \text{ in}}{2.0 \text{ in}} = 0.00415
\]

Then plug these values into the modulus formula:

\[
E = \frac{64,000 \text{ psi}}{0.00415} \approx 15,421,686 \text{ psi}
\]

### (c) Tensile Strength

Tensile strength (\(\sigma_{TS}\)) is calculated using the maximum load:

\[
\sigma_{TS} = \frac{\text{Maximum Load}}{\text{Original Cross-sectional Area}}
\]

Given:
- Maximum Load = 60,000 lb

\[
\sigma_{TS} = \frac{60,000 \text{ lb}}{0.5 \text{ in}^2} = 120,000 \text{ psi}
\]

### (d) Percent Elongation

Percent elongation is determined by:

\[
\text{Percent Elongation} = \left(\frac{\text{Final Gage Length} - \text{Original Gage Length}}{\text{Original Gage Length}}\right) \times 100\%
\]

Given:
- Final Gage Length = 2.92 in
- Original Gage Length = 2.0 in

\[
\text{Percent Elongation} = \left(\frac{2.92 - 2.0}{2.0}\right) \times 100\% = 46\%
\]

### (e) Percent Reduction in Area

Percent reduction in area is determined by:

\[
\text{Percent Reduction in Area} = \left(\frac{\text{Original Area} - \text{Final Area}}{\text{Original Area}}\right) \times 100\%
\]

Given:
- Final Area = 0.25 in\(^2\)

\[
\text{Percent Reduction in Area} = \left(\frac{0.5 - 0.25}{0.5}\right) \times 100\% = 50\%
\]

"During a tensile test in which the starting gage length = 125.0 mm and the cross-sectional area = 62.5 mm2, the following force and gage length data are collected (1) 17,793 N at 125.23 mm, (2) 23,042 N at 131.25 mm, (3) 27,579 N at 140.05 mm, (4) 28, 913 N at 147.01 mm, (5) 27,578 N at 153.00 mm, and (6) 20,462 N at 160.10 mm.

I'll walk through the steps required to plot the engineering stress-strain curve, and calculate the yield strength, modulus of elasticity, and tensile strength.

**Step 1: Calculate Engineering Stress and Strain**

Engineering stress (\(\sigma\)) is defined as the load (\(F\)) divided by the original cross-sectional area (\(A_0\)):

\[
\sigma = \frac{F}{A_0}
\]

Engineering strain (\(\epsilon\)) is defined as the change in length (\(\Delta L\)) divided by the original gage length (\(L_0\)):

\[
\epsilon = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0}
\]

where \(L\) is the gage length at a given load.

Given:
- \(A_0 = 62.5 \, \text{mm}^2\)
- \(L_0 = 125.0 \, \text{mm}\)

We'll calculate the engineering stress and strain for each data point.

**Data Point 1: (17,793 N at 125.23 mm)**
- Stress: \(\sigma_1 = \frac{17,793 \, \text{N}}{62.5 \, \text{mm}^2} = 284.69 \, \text{MPa}\)
- Strain: \(\epsilon_1 = \frac{125.23 \, \text{mm} - 125.0 \, \text{mm}}{125.0 \, \text{mm}} = 0.00184\)

**Data Point 2: (23,042 N at 131.25 mm)**
- Stress: \(\sigma_2 = \frac{23,042 \, \text{N}}{62.5 \, \text{mm}^2} = 368.67 \, \text{MPa}\)
- Strain: \(\epsilon_2 = \frac{131.25 \, \text{mm} - 125.0 \, \text{mm}}{125.0 \, \text{mm}} = 0.050\)

**Data Point 3: (27,579 N at 140.05 mm)**
- Stress: \(\sigma_3 = \frac{27,579 \, \text{N}}{62.5 \, \text{mm}^2} = 441.26 \, \text{MPa}\)
- Strain: \(\epsilon_3 = \frac{140.05 \, \text{mm} - 125.0 \, \text{mm}}{125.0 \, \text{mm}} = 0.1204\)

**Data Point 4: (28,913 N at 147.01 mm)**
- Stress: \(\sigma_4 = \frac{28,913 \, \text{N}}{62.5 \, \text{mm}^2} = 462.61 \, \text{MPa}\)
- Strain: \(\epsilon_4 = \frac{147.01 \, \text{mm} - 125.0 \, \text{mm}}{125.0 \, \text{mm}} = 0.17608\)

**Data Point 5: (27,578 N at 153.00 mm)**
- Stress: \(\sigma_5 = \frac{27,578 \, \text{N}}{62.5 \, \text{mm}^2} = 441.25 \, \text{MPa}\)
- Strain: \(\epsilon_5 = \frac{153.00 \, \text{mm} - 125.0 \, \text{mm}}{125.0 \, \text{mm}} = 0.224\)

**Data Point 6: (20,462 N at 160.10 mm)**
- Stress: \(\sigma_6 = \frac{20,462 \, \text{N}}{62.5 \, \text{mm}^2} = 327.39 \, \text{MPa}\)
- Strain: \(\epsilon_6 = \frac{160.10 \, \text{mm} - 125.0 \, \text{mm}}{125.0 \, \text{mm}} = 0.2808\)

**Step 2: Plot the Engineering Stress-Strain Curve**

Using the calculated stress and strain values, plot the points on a graph with stress on the vertical axis and strain on the horizontal axis. Connect the points to form the stress-strain curve.

**Step 3: Determine Yield Strength**

Yield strength can be determined from the stress-strain curve, typically using a 0.2% offset method if the plot exhibits a clear yield point which this data does not provide directly. So typically a linear elastic portion is estimated then a horizontal drop is checked.
   
However due to limitations here, we would assume most direct maximum possible pre-yield on the curvature (linear portion using initial two points).

Calculating slope from point (1) to (2):
\[
\text{Slope of Initial Linear Portion} = \frac{\sigma_2 - \sigma_1}{\epsilon_2 - \epsilon_1} = \frac{368.67 \, \text{MPa} - 284.69 \, \text{MPa}}{0.050 - 0.00184} = 1721 \, \text{MPa}
\]

Thus, Modulus of Elasticity \((E)\) would be approximately \( \approx 1721 \, \text{MPa} \).

**Step 4: Determine Tensile Strength**

The tensile strength is the maximum stress reached during the test, which is observed at the maximum load:
- Tensile strength = 462.61 MPa (from Data Point 4).

**Final Answers:**

- **(b) Yield Strength:** Assumed due to given data limitations around initial data continuity (no clear points), potentially estimated at ~285 MPa interpolative for calculation purposes.
- **(c) Modulus of Elasticity (E):** Approximately 1721 MPa
- **(d) Tensile Strength:** 462.61 MPa

A tensile test for a certain metal provides flow curve parameters: strain-hardening exponent is 0.3 and strength coefficient is 600 MPa. Determine (a) the flow stress at a true strain = 1.0 and (b) true strain at a flow stress = 600 MPa.,Solution: (a) Yf = 600(1.0)^.3 = 600 MPa (b) H = (600/600)^(1/.3) = (1.0)^3.33 = 1.00,"To solve the given problem, we use the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = K \epsilon^n
\]

where:
- \(\sigma\) = true stress
- \(K\) = strength coefficient
- \(\epsilon\) = true strain
- \(n\) = strain-hardening exponent

Given values:
- \(K = 600 \, \text{MPa}\)
- \(n = 0.3\)

**Part (a):** Flow stress at a true strain of 1.0

Substitute \(\epsilon = 1.0\) into the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = 600 \times (1.0)^{0.3}
\]

Since \((1.0)^{0.3} = 1.0\),

\[
\sigma = 600 \, \text{MPa}
\]

**Part (b):** True strain at a flow stress of 600 MPa

Given \(\sigma = 600 \, \text{MPa}\), substitute and solve for \(\epsilon\):

\[
600 = 600 \times \epsilon^{0.3}
\]

Divide both sides by 600:

\[
1 = \epsilon^{0.3}
\]

Taking the reciprocal power to solve for \(\epsilon\):

\[
\epsilon = 1^{1/0.3} = 1.0
\]

Therefore, the solutions are:
- (a) The flow stress at a true strain of 1.0 is 600 MPa.
- (b) The true strain at a flow stress of 600 MPa is 1.0.","Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.  

![](images/2568ff5aca665b9fc84e7b1a562fccf1c25a27242085edc83566c161baa241a7.jpg)  
FIGURE 3.5  True stress–strain  curve plotted on log–log scale.  

Because it is a straight line in this transformation of the data, the relationship  between true stress and true strain in the plastic region can be expressed as  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

This equation is called the  ﬂ  ow curve , and it provides a good approximation of the  behavior of metals in the plastic region, including their capacity for strain hardening.  The constant $K$  is called the  strength coefﬁ  cient , MPa  $(1{\mathrm{b}}/{\mathrm{in}}^{2}),$  and it equals the value  of true stress at a true strain value equal to one. The parameter  $n$  is called the  strain  hardening exponent , and it is the slope of the line in Figure 3.5. Its value is directly  related to a metal’s tendency to work harden. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for selected  metals are given in Table 3.4.

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine the strength coefﬁ  cient and  strain hardening exponent in the ﬂ  ow curve equation: $\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}$ .  

Solution:  We have two points on the ﬂ  ow curve from which the ﬂ  ow curve  parameters can be determined: (1) at the yield point and (2) at the maximum  load.  

(1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ . (1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ .  

Solving for $n$  and $K$ ,  

(1) $K=160/(0.001998)^{n}$  and (2) $K=375/(0.143)^{n}$   $160/(0.001998)^{n}=375/(0.143)^{n}$  

 $\ln(160)-n\ln(0.001998)=\ln(375)-n\ln(0.143$  ln(0.143)

 $5.0752-(-6.2156)n=5.9269-(-1.9449)n

$ $5.0752+6.2156n=5.9269+1.9449n

$ $(6.2156-1.9449)n=5.9269-5.0752

$ $4.2707n=0.8517$        $n=0.1994$ Substituting back into (1): $K=160/(0.001998)^{0.1994}=552.7$ .  

Check:  Using (2):  $K=375/(0.143)^{0.1994}=552.7.$  

The ﬂ  ow curve equation is $\sigma={\tt552.7}\epsilon^{\tt0.1994}$ .  

Necking in a tensile test and in metal forming operations that stretch the work  part is closely related to strain hardening. As the test specimen is elongated during  the initial part of the test (before necking begins), uniform straining occurs through- out the length because if any element in the specimen becomes strained more than  the surrounding metal, its strength increases by work hardening, thus making it  more resistant to additional strain until the surrounding metal has been strained  an equal amount. Finally, the strain becomes so large that uniform straining cannot  be sustained. A weak point in the length develops (from buildup of dislocations at  grain boundaries, impurities in the metal, or other factors), and necking is initiated,  leading to failure. Empirical evidence reveals that necking begins for a particular  metal when the true strain reaches a value equal to the strain-hardening exponent $n$ .  Therefore, a higher $n$  value means that the metal can be strained further before the  onset of necking during tensile loading.  

Types of Stress–Strain Relationships  Much information about elastic–plastic  behavior is provided by the true stress–strain curve. As indicated, Hooke’s law  ( $\mathit{(\sigma=E\epsilon)}$ ) governs the metal’s behavior in the elastic region, and the ﬂ  ow curve  

![](images/8d5e447efc041717923fec58799d69344712cc5d7450b72b50acbece2dd1e56f.jpg)  
FIGURE 3.6  Three  categories of stress– strain relationship:  (a) perfectly elastic,  (b) elastic and perfectly  plastic, and (c) elastic  and strain hardening.  

$(\sigma\,=\,K\epsilon^{n})$ ) determines the behavior in the plastic region. Three basic forms of  stress–strain relationship describe the behavior of nearly all types of solid materi- als, shown in Figure 3.6:  

(a)  Perfectly elastic . The behavior of this material is deﬁ  ned completely by its stiff- ness, indicated by the modulus of elasticity  $\mathcal{L}$ . It fractures rather than yielding  to plastic ﬂ  ow. Brittle materials such as ceramics, many cast irons, and thermo- setting polymers possess stress–strain curves that fall into this category. The typical stress–strain relationship for a metal exhibits elasticity below the  yield point and strain hardening above it. Figures 3.4 and 3.5 indicate this behavior  in linear and logarithmic axes. In the plastic region, the metal’s behavior is expressed  by the ﬂ  ow curve:  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

where $K=$  the strength coefﬁ  cient, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ; and $n$  is the strain hardening expo- nent. The stress  $\sigma$  and strain  $\epsilon$  in the ﬂ  ow curve are true stress and true strain. The  ﬂ  ow curve is generally valid as a relationship that deﬁ  nes a metal’s plastic behavior  in cold working. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for different metals at room temperature  are listed in Table 3.4.  

Flow Stress  The ﬂ  ow curve describes the stress–strain relationship in the region  in which metal forming takes place. It indicates the ﬂ  ow stress of the metal—the  strength property that determines forces and power required to accomplish a par- ticular forming operation. For most metals at room temperature, the stress–strain  plot of Figure 3.5 indicates that as the metal is deformed, its strength increases  due to strain hardening. The stress required to continue deformation must be  increased to match this increase in strength.  Flow stress  is deﬁ  ned as the instan- taneous value of stress required to continue deforming the material—to keep the  metal “ﬂ  owing.” It is the yield strength of the metal as a function of strain, which  can be expressed:  

$$
Y_{f}=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

where  $Y_{f}=$  ﬂ  ow stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ .  

In the individual forming operations discussed in the following two chapters, the  instantaneous ﬂ  ow stress can be used to analyze the process as it is occurring. For  example, in certain forging operations, the instantaneous force during compression  can be determined from the ﬂ  ow stress value. Maximum force can be calculated  based on the ﬂ  ow stress that results from the ﬁ  nal strain at the end of the forging  stroke.  

In other cases, the analysis is based on the average stresses and strains that occur  during deformation rather than instantaneous values. Extrusion represents this case,  Figure 17.2(c). As the billet is reduced in cross section to pass through the extrusion  die opening, the metal gradually strain hardens to reach a maximum value. Rather  than determine a sequence of instantaneous stress–strain values during the reduc- tion, which would be not only difﬁ  cult but also of limited interest, it is more useful to  analyze the process based on the average ﬂ  ow stress during deformation.  

Average Flow Stress  The average ﬂ  ow stress (also called the  mean ﬂ  ow stress ) is  the average value of stress over the stress–strain curve from the beginning of strain  to the ﬁ  nal (maximum) value that occurs during deformation. The value is illustrated  in the stress–strain plot of Figure 17.4. The average ﬂ  ow stress is determined by inte- grating the ﬂ  ow curve equation, Equation (17.1), between zero and the ﬁ  nal strain  value deﬁ  ning the range of interest. This yields the equation:  

$$
\overline{{Y}}_{f}=\frac{K\epsilon^{n}}{1+n}

"The flow curve for a certain metal has a strain-hardening exponent of 0.22 and strength coefficient of 54,000 lb/in2. Determine (a) the flow stress at a true strain = 0.45 and (b) the true strain at a flow stress = 40,000 lb/in2.","Solution: (a) Yf = 54,000(0.45)^.22 = 45,300 lb/in2 (b) H = (40,000/54,000)^(1/.22) = (0.7407)^4.545 = 0.256","To solve this problem, we'll use the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = K \epsilon^n
\]

where:
- \( \sigma \) = flow stress
- \( K \) = strength coefficient
- \( \epsilon \) = true strain
- \( n \) = strain-hardening exponent

Given values:
- \( K = 54,000 \) lb/in²
- \( n = 0.22 \)

### (a) Flow Stress at a True Strain of 0.45

We'll use the flow curve equation to find the flow stress \(\sigma\):

\[
\sigma = 54,000 \times (0.45)^{0.22}
\]

First, calculate \( (0.45)^{0.22} \):

\[
(0.45)^{0.22} \approx 0.782
\]

Now, substitute back into the equation:

\[
\sigma = 54,000 \times 0.782 \approx 42,228\; \text{lb/in}^2
\]

### (b) True Strain at a Flow Stress of 40,000 lb/in²

We'll rearrange the flow curve equation to solve for \(\epsilon\):

\[
40,000 = 54,000 \times \epsilon^{0.22}
\]

First, solve for \(\epsilon^{0.22}\):

\[
\epsilon^{0.22} = \frac{40,000}{54,000} \approx 0.7407
\]

Now, solve for \(\epsilon\) by raising both sides to the power of \(\frac{1}{0.22}\):

\[
\epsilon = (0.7407)^{\frac{1}{0.22}}
\]

Calculate this value:

\[
\epsilon \approx 0.407
\]

### Final Answers

(a) The flow stress at a true strain of 0.45 is approximately 42,228 lb/in².

(b) The true strain at a flow stress of 40,000 lb/in² is approximately 0.407.","The typical stress–strain relationship for a metal exhibits elasticity below the  yield point and strain hardening above it. Figures 3.4 and 3.5 indicate this behavior  in linear and logarithmic axes. In the plastic region, the metal’s behavior is expressed  by the ﬂ  ow curve:  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

where $K=$  the strength coefﬁ  cient, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ; and $n$  is the strain hardening expo- nent. The stress  $\sigma$  and strain  $\epsilon$  in the ﬂ  ow curve are true stress and true strain. The  ﬂ  ow curve is generally valid as a relationship that deﬁ  nes a metal’s plastic behavior  in cold working. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for different metals at room temperature  are listed in Table 3.4.  

Flow Stress  The ﬂ  ow curve describes the stress–strain relationship in the region  in which metal forming takes place. It indicates the ﬂ  ow stress of the metal—the  strength property that determines forces and power required to accomplish a par- ticular forming operation. For most metals at room temperature, the stress–strain  plot of Figure 3.5 indicates that as the metal is deformed, its strength increases  due to strain hardening. The stress required to continue deformation must be  increased to match this increase in strength.  Flow stress  is deﬁ  ned as the instan- taneous value of stress required to continue deforming the material—to keep the  metal “ﬂ  owing.” It is the yield strength of the metal as a function of strain, which  can be expressed:  

$$
Y_{f}=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

where  $Y_{f}=$  ﬂ  ow stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ .  

In the individual forming operations discussed in the following two chapters, the  instantaneous ﬂ  ow stress can be used to analyze the process as it is occurring. For  example, in certain forging operations, the instantaneous force during compression  can be determined from the ﬂ  ow stress value. Maximum force can be calculated  based on the ﬂ  ow stress that results from the ﬁ  nal strain at the end of the forging  stroke.  

In other cases, the analysis is based on the average stresses and strains that occur  during deformation rather than instantaneous values. Extrusion represents this case,  Figure 17.2(c). As the billet is reduced in cross section to pass through the extrusion  die opening, the metal gradually strain hardens to reach a maximum value. Rather  than determine a sequence of instantaneous stress–strain values during the reduc- tion, which would be not only difﬁ  cult but also of limited interest, it is more useful to  analyze the process based on the average ﬂ  ow stress during deformation.  

Average Flow Stress  The average ﬂ  ow stress (also called the  mean ﬂ  ow stress ) is  the average value of stress over the stress–strain curve from the beginning of strain  to the ﬁ  nal (maximum) value that occurs during deformation. The value is illustrated  in the stress–strain plot of Figure 17.4. The average ﬂ  ow stress is determined by inte- grating the ﬂ  ow curve equation, Equation (17.1), between zero and the ﬁ  nal strain  value deﬁ  ning the range of interest. This yields the equation:  

$$
\overline{{Y}}_{f}=\frac{K\epsilon^{n}}{1+n}
$$

where   $\overline{{Y}}_{f}\,=$  average ﬂ  ow stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ; and  $\epsilon=$ maximum strain value during  the deformation process. Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.

FIGURE 3.5  True stress–strain  curve plotted on log–log scale.  

Because it is a straight line in this transformation of the data, the relationship  between true stress and true strain in the plastic region can be expressed as  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

This equation is called the  ﬂ  ow curve , and it provides a good approximation of the  behavior of metals in the plastic region, including their capacity for strain hardening.  The constant $K$  is called the  strength coefﬁ  cient , MPa  $(1{\mathrm{b}}/{\mathrm{in}}^{2}),$  and it equals the value  of true stress at a true strain value equal to one. The parameter  $n$  is called the  strain  hardening exponent , and it is the slope of the line in Figure 3.5. Its value is directly  related to a metal’s tendency to work harden. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for selected  metals are given in Table 3.4.

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine the strength coefﬁ  cient and  strain hardening exponent in the ﬂ  ow curve equation: $\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}$ .  

Solution:  We have two points on the ﬂ  ow curve from which the ﬂ  ow curve  parameters can be determined: (1) at the yield point and (2) at the maximum  load.  

(1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ . (1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ .  

Solving for $n$  and $K$ ,  

(1) $K=160/(0.001998)^{n}$  and (2) $K=375/(0.143)^{n}$   $160/(0.001998)^{n}=375/(0.143)^{n}$  

 $\ln(160)-n\ln(0.001998)=\ln(375)-n\ln(0.143$  ln(0.143)

 $5.0752-(-6.2156)n=5.9269-(-1.9449)n

$ $5.0752+6.2156n=5.9269+1.9449n

$ $(6.2156-1.9449)n=5.9269-5.0752

$ $4.2707n=0.8517$        $n=0.1994$ Substituting back into (1): $K=160/(0.001998)^{0.1994}=552.7$ .  

Check:  Using (2):  $K=375/(0.143)^{0.1994}=552.7.$  

The ﬂ  ow curve equation is $\sigma={\tt552.7}\epsilon^{\tt0.1994}$ .  

Necking in a tensile test and in metal forming operations that stretch the work  part is closely related to strain hardening. As the test specimen is elongated during  the initial part of the test (before necking begins), uniform straining occurs through- out the length because if any element in the specimen becomes strained more than  the surrounding metal, its strength increases by work hardening, thus making it  more resistant to additional strain until the surrounding metal has been strained  an equal amount. Finally, the strain becomes so large that uniform straining cannot  be sustained. A weak point in the length develops (from buildup of dislocations at  grain boundaries, impurities in the metal, or other factors), and necking is initiated,  leading to failure. Empirical evidence reveals that necking begins for a particular  metal when the true strain reaches a value equal to the strain-hardening exponent $n$ .  Therefore, a higher $n$  value means that the metal can be strained further before the  onset of necking during tensile loading.  

Types of Stress–Strain Relationships  Much information about elastic–plastic  behavior is provided by the true stress–strain curve. As indicated, Hooke’s law  ( $\mathit{(\sigma=E\epsilon)}$ ) governs the metal’s behavior in the elastic region, and the ﬂ  ow curve

If the metal had been strained in compression, determine the final compressed length of the specimen such that (a) the engineering strain is equal to the same value as in tension (it will be negative value because of compression), and (b) the true strain would be equal to the same value as in tension (again, it will be negative value because of compression).

**Definitions:**

1. **Engineering Strain (\(e\))**: This is defined as the change in length divided by the original length.
   \[
   e = \frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0}
   \]
   where \(L_f\) is the final length and \(L_0\) is the initial length.

2. **True Strain (\(\epsilon\))**: This is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the final length to the initial length.
   \[
   \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L_f}{L_0}\right)
   \]

**Given:**

The specimen is elongated to twice its original length:
- \(L_f = 2L_0\)

**Step 1: Calculate the Engineering Strain in Tension**

\[
e = \frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{2L_0 - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{L_0}{L_0} = 1
\]

The engineering strain in tension is \(e = 1\).

**Step 2: Calculate the True Strain in Tension**

\[
\epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L_f}{L_0}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{2L_0}{L_0}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

The true strain in tension is \(\epsilon = \ln(2)\).

**Compression Analysis:**

Now let's consider the compression scenarios:

**(a) Compressed Length for Equal Engineering Strain**

To find the compressed length (\(L'_f\)) such that the engineering strain is the same (but negative), we solve:
\[
e = -1 = \frac{L'_f - L_0}{L_0}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
-1 = \frac{L'_f - L_0}{L_0}
\]
\[
-1 = \frac{L'_f}{L_0} - 1
\]
\[
\frac{L'_f}{L_0} = 0
\]

This implies:
\[
L'_f = 0 \times L_0 = 0
\]

Note that the solution \(L'_f = 0\) is impossible in a physical sense, because it suggests the specimen has no length, which cannot occur in reality. This illustrates a limitation of the engineering strain under large deformations.

**(b) Compressed Length for Equal True Strain**

To find the compressed length with the same true strain magnitude (but negative), solve:
\[
-\ln(2) = \ln\left(\frac{L'_f}{L_0}\right)
\]

This implies:
\[
\frac{L'_f}{L_0} = e^{-\ln(2)}
\]
\[
\frac{L'_f}{L_0} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus:
\[
L'_f = \frac{1}{2} \times L_0 = 0.5L_0
\]

**Final Answer:**

1. Engineering strain in tension: \( e = 1 \)
2. True strain in tension: \( \epsilon = \ln(2) \)
3. Compressed length for equal engineering strain: Impossible (\(L'_f = 0\))
4. Compressed length for equal true strain: \( L'_f = 0.5L_0 \)",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.12
"Derive an expression for true strain as a function of D and Do for a tensile test specimen of round cross section, where D = the instantaneous diameter of the specimen and Do is its original diameter.","Solution: Starting with the definition of true strain as H = ln(L/Lo) and assuming constant volume, we have V = AoLo = AL Therefore, L/Lo = Ao/A       A =pi D^2 and Ao =pi Do^2 and A0=piD^2        Ao/A = piDo^2/piD^2 = (Do/D)2 H = ln(Do/D)2 = 2ln(Do/D)","To derive an expression for true strain as a function of the instantaneous diameter \( D \) and the original diameter \( D_o \) for a tensile test specimen with a round cross-section, follow these steps:

### Definitions and Concepts:

1. **True Strain (\(\epsilon_t\))**:
   \[
   \epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_o}\right)
   \]
   where \( L \) is the instantaneous length and \( L_o \) is the original length.

2. **Volume Constancy Assumption**:
   During plastic deformation, especially when necking starts, the volume of the specimen remains approximately constant. Therefore:
   \[
   A \cdot L = A_o \cdot L_o
   \]
   where \( A \) and \( A_o \) are the instantaneous and original cross-sectional areas, respectively.

3. **Area for a Round Cross-section**:
   \[
   A = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}, \quad A_o = \frac{\pi D_o^2}{4}
   \]

### Derivation:

Since the volume is constant, equate the original and current states:

\[
A \cdot L = A_o \cdot L_o
\]

Substituting the area expressions:

\[
\frac{\pi D^2}{4} \cdot L = \frac{\pi D_o^2}{4} \cdot L_o
\]

Cancellation and simplification give:

\[
D^2 \cdot L = D_o^2 \cdot L_o
\]

Rearranging for \( L \):

\[
L = \frac{D_o^2 \cdot L_o}{D^2}
\]

Substitute this expression for \( L \) into the true strain equation:

\[
\epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_o}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{D_o^2 \cdot L_o / D^2}{L_o}\right)
\]

Simplify:

\[
\epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{D_o^2}{D^2}\right)
\]

Using properties of logarithms:

\[
\epsilon_t = 2 \ln\left(\frac{D_o}{D}\right)
\]

### Final Expression:

The true strain as a function of the instantaneous diameter \( D \) and the original diameter \( D_o \) is:

\[
\epsilon_t = 2 \ln\left(\frac{D_o}{D}\right)
\]","To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ .

The load and the change in length of the specimen are recorded as testing proceeds,  to provide the data required to determine the stress–strain relationship. There are  two different types of stress–strain curves: (1) engineering stress–strain and (2) true  stress–strain. The ﬁ  rst is more important in design, and the second is more important  in manufacturing.  

Engineering Stress–strain   The engineering stress and strain in a tensile test are  deﬁ  ned relative to the original area and length of the test specimen. These values are  of interest in design because the designer expects that the strains experienced by any  component of the product will not signiﬁ  cantly change its shape. The components  are designed to withstand the anticipated stresses encountered in service.  

A typical engineering stress–strain curve from a tensile test of a metallic speci- men is illustrated in Figure 3.3. The  engineering stress  at any point on the curve is  deﬁ  ned as the force divided by the original area:  

$$
s=\frac{F}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $s=$  engineering stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ );  $F=$  applied force in the test, $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A_{o}=$  original area of the test specimen,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}$   $(\mathrm{in}^{2}]$ ). The  engineering strain  at any  point in the test is given by  

$$
e=\frac{L-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $e\:=\:$  engineering strain,  $\mathrm{mm/mm~(in/in)}$ ;  $L=$ length at any point during the  elongation, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and $L_{o}=$  original gage length, mm (in). The units of engineer- ing strain are given as $\mathrm{mm/mm}$  (in/in), but think of it as representing elongation per  unit length, without units.  

The stress–strain relationship in Figure 3.3 has two regions, indicating two dis- tinct forms of behavior: (1) elastic and (2) plastic. In the elastic region, the relation- ship between stress and strain is linear, and the material exhibits elastic behavior by  

![](images/d0bec5dc14bfbf80832d78675a36196cfd2800b33ec74d7a6c30553b276140c2.jpg)  

returning to its original length when the load (stress) is released. The relationship is  deﬁ  ned by  Hooke’s law :  

$$
s=E e
$$  

where  $E=$   modulus of elasticity  (also known as  Young’s modulus ), MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ,  a measure of the inherent stiffness of a material. It is a constant of proportionality  whose value is different for different materials. Table 3.1 presents typical values for  several materials, metals and nonmetals.  

As stress increases, some point in the linear relationship is ﬁ  nally reached at  which the material begins to yield. This  yield point   $Y$ of the material can be identi- ﬁ  ed in the ﬁ  gure by the change in slope at the end of the linear region. Because the  start of yielding is usually difﬁ  cult to see in a plot of test data (it does not usually oc- cur as an abrupt change in slope), $Y$  is typically deﬁ  ned as the stress at which a strain  offset of  $0.2\%$  from the straight line has occurred. (1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ .  

Solving for $n$  and $K$ ,  

(1) $K=160/(0.001998)^{n}$  and (2) $K=375/(0.143)^{n}$   $160/(0.001998)^{n}=375/(0.143)^{n}$  

 $\ln(160)-n\ln(0.001998)=\ln(375)-n\ln(0.143$  ln(0.143)

 $5.0752-(-6.2156)n=5.9269-(-1.9449)n

$ $5.0752+6.2156n=5.9269+1.9449n

$ $(6.2156-1.9449)n=5.9269-5.0752

$ $4.2707n=0.8517$        $n=0.1994$ Substituting back into (1): $K=160/(0.001998)^{0.1994}=552.7$ .  

Check:  Using (2):  $K=375/(0.143)^{0.1994}=552.7.$  

The ﬂ  ow curve equation is $\sigma={\tt552.7}\epsilon^{\tt0.1994}$ .  

Necking in a tensile test and in metal forming operations that stretch the work  part is closely related to strain hardening. As the test specimen is elongated during  the initial part of the test (before necking begins), uniform straining occurs through- out the length because if any element in the specimen becomes strained more than  the surrounding metal, its strength increases by work hardening, thus making it  more resistant to additional strain until the surrounding metal has been strained  an equal amount. Finally, the strain becomes so large that uniform straining cannot  be sustained. A weak point in the length develops (from buildup of dislocations at  grain boundaries, impurities in the metal, or other factors), and necking is initiated,  leading to failure. Empirical evidence reveals that necking begins for a particular  metal when the true strain reaches a value equal to the strain-hardening exponent $n$ .  Therefore, a higher $n$  value means that the metal can be strained further before the  onset of necking during tensile loading.  

Types of Stress–Strain Relationships  Much information about elastic–plastic  behavior is provided by the true stress–strain curve. As indicated, Hooke’s law  ( $\mathit{(\sigma=E\epsilon)}$ ) governs the metal’s behavior in the elastic region, and the ﬂ  ow curve

### Definitions:

1. **Engineering Strain (\( e \))**:
   - Engineering strain is the ratio of the change in length (\( \Delta L \)) to the original length (\( L_0 \)):
     \[
     e = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0} = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{L}{L_0} - 1
     \]

2. **True Strain (\( \epsilon \))**:
   - True strain is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the current length (\( L \)) to the original length (\( L_0 \)):
     \[
     \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right)
     \]

### Derivation:

Start with the expression for true strain:

\[
\epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right)
\]

Substitute the expression for engineering strain:

\[
L = (1 + e) L_0
\]

Replace \( L \) in the true strain definition:

\[
\epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{(1 + e) L_0}{L_0}\right) = \ln(1 + e)
\]

Thus, we have derived:

\[
\epsilon = \ln(1 + e)
\]

### Conclusion:
This derivation confirms that true strain \( \epsilon \) can be expressed in terms of the engineering strain \( e \) as:

\[ 
\epsilon = \ln(1 + e) 
\] 

This demonstrates the relationship between true and engineering strain.","In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the

previous curve, a downturn ﬁ  nally occurs as a result of necking. A dashed line is used  in the ﬁ  gure to indicate the projected continuation of the true stress–strain plot if  necking had not occurred.  

As strain becomes signiﬁ  cant in the plastic region, the values of true strain and  engineering strain diverge. True strain can be related to the corresponding engineer- ing strain by  

$$
\epsilon=\ln(1+e)
$$  

Similarly, true stress and engineering stress can be related by the expression  

$$
\sigma=s\,(1\,+\,e)
$$  

In Figure 3.4, note that stress increases continuously in the plastic region until  necking begins. When this happened in the engineering stress–strain curve, its sig- niﬁ  cance was lost because an admittedly erroneous area value was used to calculate  stress. Now when the true stress also increases, it cannot be dismissed so lightly.  What it means is that the metal is becoming stronger as strain increases. This is the  property called  strain hardening  that was mentioned in the previous chapter in the  discussion of metallic crystal structures, and it is a property that most metals exhibit  to a greater or lesser degree.  

# Example 3.2  True stress and  strain  

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine (a) true stress and (b) true strain  at the maximum load of  $65{,}000\:\mathrm{N}.$ .  

Solution:  (a) True stress is deﬁ  ned as the load divided by the instantaneous  area. To ﬁ  nd the instantaneous area, we assume uniform elongation prior to  necking. Thus, $A L=A_{o}L_{o}$ , and $A=A_{o}L_{o}/L=200(50)/57.7=173.3\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}/$  

$$
{\sigma=F/A=65,\!000/173.3=375\;\mathrm{MPa}}
$$  

(b) By Equation (3.7), true strain $\epsilon=\ln(L/L_{o})=\ln(57.7/50)=$ $\ln(1.154)={\bf0.143}$ .  

Check:  Use Equations (3.8) and (3.9) to check these values:  

Using Equation (3.8) and the value of  $e$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\epsilon=\ln(1+0.154)=0.143$ .  

Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.  

! (1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .

 $\ln(160)-n\ln(0.001998)=\ln(375)-n\ln(0.143$  ln(0.143)

$ $5.0752+6.2156n=5.9269+1.9449n

$ $(6.2156-1.9449)n=5.9269-5.0752

$ $4.2707n=0.8517$        $n=0.1994$ Substituting back into (1): $K=160/(0.001998)^{0.1994}=552.7$ .  

Check:  Using (2):  $K=375/(0.143)^{0.1994}=552.7.$  

The ﬂ  ow curve equation is $\sigma={\tt552.7}\epsilon^{\tt0.1994}$ .

This equation is called the  ﬂ  ow curve , and it provides a good approximation of the  behavior of metals in the plastic region, including their capacity for strain hardening.  The constant $K$  is called the  strength coefﬁ  cient , MPa  $(1{\mathrm{b}}/{\mathrm{in}}^{2}),$  and it equals the value  of true stress at a true strain value equal to one.

However, it should be noted that these values are associated with the necked portion of the test specimen.","To determine the true stress and true strain at failure for the copper wire, we can follow these steps:

### True Stress

Given:
- Engineering stress at failure = \( \sigma_e = 248.2 \, \text{MPa} \)
- Reduction of area = 75%

The true stress \( \sigma_t \) is given by the relationship:

\[
\sigma_t = \sigma_e \left( \frac{A_0}{A_f} \right)
\]

Where:
\[ \frac{A_0 - A_f}{A_0} = 0.75 \]

This implies:
\[ \frac{A_f}{A_0} = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 \]

Thus:
\[
\sigma_t = 248.2 \, \text{MPa} \times \frac{1}{0.25} = 992.8 \, \text{MPa}
\]

### True Strain

True strain \( \epsilon_t \) is given by:

\[
\epsilon_t = \ln \left( \frac{A_0}{A_f} \right)
\]

Using the same ratio:
\[
\epsilon_t = \ln \left( \frac{1}{0.25} \right) = \ln(4) \approx 1.386
\]

### Final Answer

- True stress at failure: \( 992.8 \, \text{MPa} \)
- True strain at failure: \( 1.386 \)","During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}.

$ (b) Subtracting the $0.2\%$  offset, engineering strain  $e=(50.2-50.0)/50.0\;-

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the  

! To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

metallic test specimens and the associated nonuniform effect on elongation and area  reduction. Despite these difﬁ  culties, percent elongation and percent area reduction  are the most commonly used measures of ductility in engineering practice. Some  typical values of percent elongation for various materials (mostly metals) are listed  in Table 3.3.  

# Example 3.1  Engineering  stress and strain  

A tensile test specimen has a starting gage length $=50\:\mathrm{mm}$  and a cross-sectional  area $=200\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ . During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}. (1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ .  

Solving for $n$  and $K$ ,  

(1) $K=160/(0.001998)^{n}$  and (2) $K=375/(0.143)^{n}$   $160/(0.001998)^{n}=375/(0.143)^{n}$  

 $\ln(160)-n\ln(0.001998)=\ln(375)-n\ln(0.143$  ln(0.143)

 $5.0752-(-6.2156)n=5.9269-(-1.9449)n

$ $5.0752+6.2156n=5.9269+1.9449n

$ $(6.2156-1.9449)n=5.9269-5.0752

$ $4.2707n=0.8517$        $n=0.1994$ Substituting back into (1): $K=160/(0.001998)^{0.1994}=552.7$ .  

Check:  Using (2):  $K=375/(0.143)^{0.1994}=552.7.$  

The ﬂ  ow curve equation is $\sigma={\tt552.7}\epsilon^{\tt0.1994}$ .  

Necking in a tensile test and in metal forming operations that stretch the work  part is closely related to strain hardening. As the test specimen is elongated during  the initial part of the test (before necking begins), uniform straining occurs through- out the length because if any element in the specimen becomes strained more than  the surrounding metal, its strength increases by work hardening, thus making it  more resistant to additional strain until the surrounding metal has been strained  an equal amount. Finally, the strain becomes so large that uniform straining cannot  be sustained. A weak point in the length develops (from buildup of dislocations at  grain boundaries, impurities in the metal, or other factors), and necking is initiated,  leading to failure. Empirical evidence reveals that necking begins for a particular  metal when the true strain reaches a value equal to the strain-hardening exponent $n$ .  Therefore, a higher $n$  value means that the metal can be strained further before the  onset of necking during tensile loading.  

Types of Stress–Strain Relationships  Much information about elastic–plastic  behavior is provided by the true stress–strain curve. As indicated, Hooke’s law  ( $\mathit{(\sigma=E\epsilon)}$ ) governs the metal’s behavior in the elastic region, and the ﬂ  ow curve

Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Given:
- Original gage length, \( L_o = 2.0 \, \text{in} \)
- Cross-sectional area, \( A_o = 0.5 \, \text{in}^2 \)
- Maximum load, \( F = 37,000 \, \text{lb} \)
- Elongation at maximum load = 24%
  
### Required:
True stress (\( \sigma \)) and true strain (\( \epsilon \)) at maximum load.

### Calculations:

#### 1. **True Stress**: 
The true stress is calculated using the actual cross-sectional area at maximum load. However, as specific final area is not given, for simplicity and when necking is not extreme, it is often assumed that volume is constant and thus:

\[ A_f = A_o \times \frac{L_o}{L} \]

Where \( L \) is the length at maximum load:
\[ L = L_o + (\text{Elongation percentage} \times L_o) \]
\[ L = 2.0 + (0.24 \times 2.0) = 2.48 \, \text{in} \]

Now, assuming constant volume, you solve for \( A_f \):
\[ A_f = 0.5 \times \frac{2.0}{2.48} = 0.4032 \, \text{in}^2 \]

Now calculate the true stress:
\[ \sigma = \frac{F}{A_f} \]
\[ \sigma = \frac{37,000}{0.4032} = 91,744.90 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \]

#### 2. **True Strain**:
The true strain is calculated using the logarithmic formula:
\[ \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_o}\right) \]
\[ \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{2.48}{2.0}\right) = \ln(1.24) = 0.215 \]

### Final Answers:
- **True Stress** = \( 91,744.90 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \)
- **True Strain** = \( 0.215 \)","During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ .

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region.

If pieces are  put back together as in  (6), ﬁ  nal length can be  measured.  

The load and the change in length of the specimen are recorded as testing proceeds,  to provide the data required to determine the stress–strain relationship. There are  two different types of stress–strain curves: (1) engineering stress–strain and (2) true  stress–strain. The ﬁ  rst is more important in design, and the second is more important  in manufacturing.  

Engineering Stress–strain   The engineering stress and strain in a tensile test are  deﬁ  ned relative to the original area and length of the test specimen. These values are  of interest in design because the designer expects that the strains experienced by any  component of the product will not signiﬁ  cantly change its shape. The components  are designed to withstand the anticipated stresses encountered in service.  

A typical engineering stress–strain curve from a tensile test of a metallic speci- men is illustrated in Figure 3.3. The  engineering stress  at any point on the curve is  deﬁ  ned as the force divided by the original area:  

$$
s=\frac{F}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $s=$  engineering stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ );  $F=$  applied force in the test, $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A_{o}=$  original area of the test specimen,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}$   $(\mathrm{in}^{2}]$ ). The  engineering strain  at any  point in the test is given by  

$$
e=\frac{L-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $e\:=\:$  engineering strain,  $\mathrm{mm/mm~(in/in)}$ ;  $L=$ length at any point during the  elongation, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and $L_{o}=$  original gage length, mm (in). The units of engineer- ing strain are given as $\mathrm{mm/mm}$  (in/in), but think of it as representing elongation per  unit length, without units.  

The stress–strain relationship in Figure 3.3 has two regions, indicating two dis- tinct forms of behavior: (1) elastic and (2) plastic. In the elastic region, the relation- ship between stress and strain is linear, and the material exhibits elastic behavior by  

![](images/d0bec5dc14bfbf80832d78675a36196cfd2800b33ec74d7a6c30553b276140c2.jpg)  

returning to its original length when the load (stress) is released. The relationship is  deﬁ  ned by  Hooke’s law :  

$$
s=E e
$$  

where  $E=$   modulus of elasticity  (also known as  Young’s modulus ), MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ,  a measure of the inherent stiffness of a material. It is a constant of proportionality  whose value is different for different materials. Table 3.1 presents typical values for  several materials, metals and nonmetals.  

As stress increases, some point in the linear relationship is ﬁ  nally reached at  which the material begins to yield. This  yield point   $Y$ of the material can be identi- ﬁ  ed in the ﬁ  gure by the change in slope at the end of the linear region. Because the  start of yielding is usually difﬁ  cult to see in a plot of test data (it does not usually oc- cur as an abrupt change in slope), $Y$  is typically deﬁ  ned as the stress at which a strain  offset of  $0.2\%$  from the straight line has occurred.

We are given the flow curve parameters, the starting and final heights of the specimen, and its diameter. Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the True Strain

The true strain (\(\varepsilon\)) in a uniaxial test is given by the logarithmic decrease in height:

\[
\varepsilon = \ln \left( \frac{h_0}{h_f} \right)
\]

where:
- \( h_0 = 62.5 \, \text{mm} \) (original height)
- \( h_f = 50 \, \text{mm} \) (final height)

Substituting the given values:

\[
\varepsilon = \ln \left( \frac{62.5}{50} \right) = \ln(1.25) \approx 0.2231
\]

### Step 2: Determine the True Stress

The flow stress (\(\sigma\)) in the material is described by the constitutive equation for a power-law material:

\[
\sigma = K \varepsilon^n
\]

where:
- \( K = 620.5 \, \text{MPa} \) (strength coefficient)
- \( n = 0.26 \) (strain-hardening exponent)

Substituting the known values:

\[
\sigma = 620.5 \times (0.2231)^{0.26}
\]

Calculating the value:

\[
\sigma = 620.5 \times 0.558 = 346 \, \text{MPa} \approx 345.93 \, \text{MPa}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Cross-sectional Area

Assuming volume constancy during plastic deformation, the original volume is equal to the deformed volume:

\[
A_0 \times h_0 = A_f \times h_f
\]
where:
- \(A_0\) is the original cross-sectional area
- \(A_f\) is the final cross-sectional area

Calculate the original area (\(A_0\)):

\[
A_0 = \pi \left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^2 = \pi \left( \frac{25}{2} \right)^2 \approx 490.87 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

Using volume constancy:

\[
A_f = \frac{A_0 \times h_0}{h_f} = \frac{490.87 \times 62.5}{50} \approx 613.59 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Required Load

The load (\(F\)) required is given by:

\[
F = \sigma \times A_f
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
F = 345.93 \times 613.59
\]

Calculating the load:

\[
F \approx 211964 \, \text{N} \approx 211.96 \, \text{kN}

Here are the steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Flow Curve Equation

The flow curve equation expresses the relationship between true stress \((\sigma)\) and true strain \((\epsilon)\) as follows:

\[
\sigma = K \cdot \epsilon^n
\]

where:
- \( K \) is the strength coefficient, here 620.5 MPa.
- \( n \) is the strain-hardening exponent, here 0.26.

### Step 2: Calculate Initial and Final Dimensions and True Strain in Height

**Initial height (\( h_0 \))**: 62.5 mm

**Final height (\( h_f \))**: 37.5 mm

**Initial diameter (\( d_0 \))**: 25 mm

Since the volume remains constant during deformation, the initial and final volumes should be equal:

\[ V_0 = V_f \]

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:

\[ V = \text{Area} \times \text{Height} = \frac{\pi}{4} \times d^2 \times h \]

Thus,

\[ \frac{\pi}{4} \times d_0^2 \times h_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \times d_f^2 \times h_f \]

Simplifying, the equation for the relation between the initial and final dimensions is:

\[ d_f^2 = \frac{d_0^2 \times h_0}{h_f} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ d_f^2 = \frac{25^2 \times 62.5}{37.5} \]

\[ d_f^2 = \frac{15625 \times 62.5}{37.5} \]

\[ d_f^2 = \frac{976562.5}{37.5} \]

\[ d_f^2 = 26041.67 \]

\[ d_f \approx \sqrt{26041.67} \]

\[ d_f \approx 161.37 \text{ mm} \]

But this result would imply an error in arithmetic or incorrect approach, since it should be a consistent value and should reflect proper ratio calculations. Let's redo while focusing on calculation of true axial strain \(\epsilon\) which is critical.

True strain \(\epsilon\) in terms of height reduction is:

\[ \epsilon = \ln \left(\frac{h_0}{h_f}\right) \]

\[ \epsilon = \ln \left(\frac{62.5}{37.5}\right) \]

\[ \epsilon = \ln (1.6667) \]

\[ \epsilon \approx 0.5108 \]

### Step 3: Calculate True Stress

Now apply the flow curve equation to find the true stress:

\[ \sigma = K \cdot \epsilon^n \]

\[ \sigma = 620.5 \times 0.5108^{0.26} \]

\[ \sigma \approx 620.5 \times 0.7597 \]

\[ \sigma \approx 471.31 \text{ MPa} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Compressive Load

The formula for true stress is also:

\[ \sigma = \frac{F}{A_f} \]

Where \( F \) is the compressive load and \( A_f \) is the final cross-sectional area:

\[ A_f = \frac{\pi}{4} \times d_f^2 \]

But using the consistent approach for area from constant volume and strain:

Since height is reduced by about 40% initially:

\[ A_f = A_0 \frac{h_0}{h_f} =  \frac{\pi}{4} \times 25^2 \cdot \frac{62.5}{37.5} \]

\[ A_f =  \frac{\pi}{4} \times 25^2 \cdot 1.6667  \]

\[ A_f \approx 819.468 \text{ mm}^2 \]

Thus, 

\[ F = \sigma \times A_f \]

\[ F = 471.31 \times 819.468 \]

\[ F \approx 386092.7 \text{ N} \]

This result should be validated for real-world constraints such as end effects and friction but serves as a preliminary calculation.

### Understanding the Problem:

1. **Given Data:**
   - Initial height of specimen, \( h_0 = 2.0 \) inches
   - Diameter of specimen, \( d = 1.5 \) inches
   - Load at yield (0.2% offset method), \( F_{\text{yield}} = 140,000 \) lb
   - Height at 260,000 lb load, \( h = 1.6 \) inches (information not necessary for yield strength calculation)
   - Modulus of elasticity, \( E = 30 \times 10^6 \) lb/in²

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the **yield strength** using the 0.2% offset method.

### Steps to Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate Cross-Sectional Area

The cross-sectional area \( A \) of a specimen with a circular cross-section is given by:

\[
A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}
\]

Substituting the given diameter:

\[
A = \frac{\pi (1.5)^2}{4} = \frac{\pi \times 2.25}{4} = \frac{2.25\pi}{4} \approx 1.7671 \text{ in}^2
\]

#### Step 2: Calculate Yield Strength

The yield strength (\( \sigma_y \)) is calculated by dividing the load at yield by the cross-sectional area.

\[
\sigma_y = \frac{F_{\text{yield}}}{A}
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
\sigma_y = \frac{140,000 \text{ lb}}{1.7671 \text{ in}^2} \approx 79,234.07 \text{ psi}

\[
T R S = \frac{1.5F L}{b t^{2}}
\]

Where:
- \( T R S \) is the transverse rupture strength, given as 1000 MPa.
- \( F \) is the applied load at fracture (what we're solving for).
- \( L \) is the length of the specimen between supports, given as 60 mm.
- \( b \) is the width of the specimen, given as 15 mm.
- \( t \) is the thickness of the specimen, given as 10 mm.

Substituting these values into the equation:

\[
1000 = \frac{1.5 \times F \times 60}{15 \times 10^{2}}

Simplify the equation:

\[
1000 = \frac{90F}{1500}

Multiply both sides by 1500 to solve for \( F \):

\[

\[

The  bending test  (also known as the  ﬂ  exure test ) is  used to test the strength of these materials, using a setup illustrated in the ﬁ  rst  diagram in Figure 3.10. In this procedure, a specimen of rectangular cross section  is positioned between two supports, and a load is applied at its center. In this con- ﬁ  guration, the test is called a three-point bending test. A four-point conﬁ  guration  is also sometimes used. These brittle materials do not ﬂ  ex to the exaggerated ex- tent shown in Figure 3.10; instead they deform elastically until immediately be- fore fracture. Failure usually occurs because the ultimate tensile strength of the  outer ﬁ  bers of the specimen has been exceeded. This results in  cleavage , a failure  mode associated with ceramics and metals operating at low service temperatures,  in which separation rather than slip occurs along certain crystallographic planes.  The strength value derived from this test is called the  transverse rupture strength ,  calculated from the formula

The ﬂ  exure test is also used for certain nonbrittle materials such as thermoplastic  polymers. In this case, because the material is likely to deform rather than fracture,  TRS cannot be determined based on failure of the specimen. Instead, either of two  measures is used: (1) the load recorded at a given level of deﬂ  ection, or (2) the de- ﬂ  ection observed at a given load.  

# 3.1.4 SHEAR PROPERTIES  

Shear involves application of stresses in opposite directions on either side of a thin  element to deﬂ  ect it as shown in Figure 3.11. The shear stress is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\tau={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

![](images/54903b7bc86140704dc9a1b301a1623b6698845dbec06069b59ac3b86084a573.jpg)  

where  $\tau=$  shear stress,  $\mathrm{lb/in^{2}}$  (MPa);  $F=$  applied force,  $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A=$  area over  which the force is applied, $\mathrm{in}^{2}\left(\mathrm{mm}^{2}\right)$ . Shear strain can be deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\gamma=\frac{\delta}{b}
$$  

where  $\gamma=$  shear strain, $\mathrm{mm/mm}\;(\mathrm{in/in});\delta=$ the deﬂ  ection of the element, mm (in);  and $b=$  the orthogonal distance over which deﬂ  ection occurs, mm (in).  

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12. As torque  is increased, the tube deﬂ  ects by twisting, which is a shear strain for this geometry. To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

metallic test specimens and the associated nonuniform effect on elongation and area  reduction. Despite these difﬁ  culties, percent elongation and percent area reduction  are the most commonly used measures of ductility in engineering practice.

The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ .

During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ .

 (e) Deﬁ  ned in Equation (3.4), percent elongation $E L=(59.5-50)/50=$

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation.

# Example 3.1  Engineering  stress and strain  

A tensile test specimen has a starting gage length $=50\:\mathrm{mm}$  and a cross-sectional  area $=200\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ . During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation.

### Given Data:
- Radius \( R = 25 \, \text{mm} \)
- Wall thickness \( t = 3 \, \text{mm} \)
- Gage length \( L = 50 \, \text{mm} \)
- Torque \( T = 900 \, \text{N-m} = 900,000 \, \text{N-mm} \)
- Angular deflection \( \alpha = 0.3 \, \text{radians} \)

### (a) Shear Stress (\(\tau\))

The formula for shear stress in a torsion test is:

\[
\tau = \frac{T}{2\pi R^{2}t}
\]

Plug in the values:

\[
\tau = \frac{900,000}{2\pi \times (25)^2 \times 3}
\]

Calculate the denominator:

\[
2\pi \times (25)^2 \times 3 = 2 \pi \times 625 \times 3 = 3750 \pi
\]

Now calculate \(\tau\):

\[

\]

### Final Answers:
- **Shear Stress**: \( \tau \approx 76.39 \, \text{MPa} \)
- **Shear Strain**: \( \gamma = 0.15 \, \text{mm/mm} \)","Shear strain can be deﬁ  ned as  

$$

where  $\gamma=$  shear strain, $\mathrm{mm/mm}\;(\mathrm{in/in});\delta=$ the deﬂ  ection of the element, mm (in);  and $b=$  the orthogonal distance over which deﬂ  ection occurs, mm (in).  

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12. As torque  is increased, the tube deﬂ  ects by twisting, which is a shear strain for this geometry. The shear stress can be determined in the test by the equation  

$$
\tau=\frac{T}{2\pi R^{2}t}
$$  

where  $T=$  applied torque,  $\mathrm{N{-mm}}$  (lb-in);  $R\,=$ radius of the tube measured to the  neutral axis of the wall, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and $t=$  wall thickness, mm (in). The shear strain can  be determined by measuring the amount of angular deﬂ  ection of the tube, convert- ing this into a distance deﬂ  ected, and dividing by the gauge length  $L$ . Reducing this  to a simple expression,  

$$
\gamma={\frac{R\alpha}{L}}

where  $\upalpha=$  the angular deﬂ  ection (radians).

In the plastic region of the shear stress–strain curve, the material strain hardens  to cause the applied torque to continue to increase until fracture ﬁ  nally   occurs.  The relationship in this region is similar to the ﬂ  ow curve. The shear stress at  fracture can be calculated and this is used as the  shear strength $S$  of the material.  Shear strength can be estimated from tensile strength data by the approximation:  $S=0.7(T S)$ .  

Because the cross-sectional area of the test specimen in the torsion test does not  change as it does in the tensile and compression tests, the engineering stress–strain  curve for shear derived from the torsion test is virtually the same as the true stress– strain curve.  

Shear processes are common in industry. Shearing action is used to cut sheet metal  in blanking, punching, and other cutting operations (Section 19.1). In machining, the  material is removed by the mechanism of shear deformation (Section 20.2).  

The hardness of a material is deﬁ  ned as its resistance to permanent indentation.  Good hardness generally means that the material is resistant to scratching and wear.  For many engineering applications, including most of the tooling used in manufac- turing, scratch and wear resistance are important characteristics. As the reader shall  see later in this section, there is a strong correlation between hardness and strength.  

3.2.1  HARDNESS TESTS  

Hardness tests are commonly used for assessing material properties because they  are quick and convenient. However, a variety of testing methods are appropriate  because of differences in hardness among different materials. The best-known hard- ness tests are Brinell and Rockwell. During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}.

 (c) Tensile strength $=$  maximum load divided by original area: 

 ${\cal T}S=65{,}000/200=325~\mathrm{M}\mathrm{Pa}$ .

 (d) By Equation (3.2), engineering strain at maximum load  $e=$  

 $(57.7-50)/50={\bf0.154}$ .

 (e) Deﬁ  ned in Equation (3.4), percent elongation $E L=(59.5-50)/50=$  

 $\mathbf{0.19}=\mathbf{19\%}$ .  

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values.

load. These materials do not respond well to traditional tensile testing because of  problems in preparing the test specimens and possible misalignment of the press  jaws that hold the specimen. The  bending test  (also known as the  ﬂ  exure test ) is  used to test the strength of these materials, using a setup illustrated in the ﬁ  rst  diagram in Figure 3.10. In this procedure, a specimen of rectangular cross section  is positioned between two supports, and a load is applied at its center. In this con- ﬁ  guration, the test is called a three-point bending test. A four-point conﬁ  guration  is also sometimes used. These brittle materials do not ﬂ  ex to the exaggerated ex- tent shown in Figure 3.10; instead they deform elastically until immediately be- fore fracture. Failure usually occurs because the ultimate tensile strength of the  outer ﬁ  bers of the specimen has been exceeded. This results in  cleavage , a failure  mode associated with ceramics and metals operating at low service temperatures,  in which separation rather than slip occurs along certain crystallographic planes.  The strength value derived from this test is called the  transverse rupture strength ,  calculated from the formula  

$$
T R S={\frac{1.5F L}{b t^{2}}}
$$  

where  $T R S=$  transverse rupture strength, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  applied load at fracture,  N (lb); $L=$ length of the specimen between supports, mm (in); and  $b$  and  $t$  are the  dimensions of the cross section of the specimen as shown in the ﬁ  gure, mm (in).  

The ﬂ  exure test is also used for certain nonbrittle materials such as thermoplastic  polymers. In this case, because the material is likely to deform rather than fracture,  TRS cannot be determined based on failure of the specimen. Instead, either of two  measures is used: (1) the load recorded at a given level of deﬂ  ection, or (2) the de- ﬂ  ection observed at a given load.

where  $\tau=$  shear stress,  $\mathrm{lb/in^{2}}$  (MPa);  $F=$  applied force,  $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A=$  area over  which the force is applied, $\mathrm{in}^{2}\left(\mathrm{mm}^{2}\right)$ . Shear strain can be deﬁ  ned as

Shear processes are common in industry. Shearing action is used to cut sheet metal  in blanking, punching, and other cutting operations (Section 19.1). In machining, the  material is removed by the mechanism of shear deformation (Section 20.2).  

The hardness of a material is deﬁ  ned as its resistance to permanent indentation.  Good hardness generally means that the material is resistant to scratching and wear.  For many engineering applications, including most of the tooling used in manufac- turing, scratch and wear resistance are important characteristics. As the reader shall  see later in this section, there is a strong correlation between hardness and strength.  

3.2.1  HARDNESS TESTS  

Hardness tests are commonly used for assessing material properties because they  are quick and convenient. However, a variety of testing methods are appropriate  because of differences in hardness among different materials. The best-known hard- ness tests are Brinell and Rockwell. [](images/4fa9287e7e474f4387d790a053742a087536a2b5fe6d46af83a3ed15bed0f89e.jpg)

load. These materials do not respond well to traditional tensile testing because of  problems in preparing the test specimens and possible misalignment of the press  jaws that hold the specimen. The  bending test  (also known as the  ﬂ  exure test ) is  used to test the strength of these materials, using a setup illustrated in the ﬁ  rst  diagram in Figure 3.10. In this procedure, a specimen of rectangular cross section  is positioned between two supports, and a load is applied at its center. In this con- ﬁ  guration, the test is called a three-point bending test. A four-point conﬁ  guration  is also sometimes used. These brittle materials do not ﬂ  ex to the exaggerated ex- tent shown in Figure 3.10; instead they deform elastically until immediately be- fore fracture. Failure usually occurs because the ultimate tensile strength of the  outer ﬁ  bers of the specimen has been exceeded. This results in  cleavage , a failure  mode associated with ceramics and metals operating at low service temperatures,  in which separation rather than slip occurs along certain crystallographic planes.  The strength value derived from this test is called the  transverse rupture strength ,  calculated from the formula  

$$
T R S={\frac{1.5F L}{b t^{2}}}
$$  

where  $T R S=$  transverse rupture strength, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  applied load at fracture,  N (lb); $L=$ length of the specimen between supports, mm (in); and  $b$  and  $t$  are the  dimensions of the cross section of the specimen as shown in the ﬁ  gure, mm (in).  

The ﬂ  exure test is also used for certain nonbrittle materials such as thermoplastic  polymers. In this case, because the material is likely to deform rather than fracture,  TRS cannot be determined based on failure of the specimen. Instead, either of two  measures is used: (1) the load recorded at a given level of deﬂ  ection, or (2) the de- ﬂ  ection observed at a given load.  

# 3.1.4 SHEAR PROPERTIES  

Shear involves application of stresses in opposite directions on either side of a thin  element to deﬂ  ect it as shown in Figure 3.11. The shear stress is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\tau={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

![](images/54903b7bc86140704dc9a1b301a1623b6698845dbec06069b59ac3b86084a573.jpg)  

where  $\tau=$  shear stress,  $\mathrm{lb/in^{2}}$  (MPa);  $F=$  applied force,  $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A=$  area over  which the force is applied, $\mathrm{in}^{2}\left(\mathrm{mm}^{2}\right)$ . Shear strain can be deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\gamma=\frac{\delta}{b}
$$  

where  $\gamma=$  shear strain, $\mathrm{mm/mm}\;(\mathrm{in/in});\delta=$ the deﬂ  ection of the element, mm (in);  and $b=$  the orthogonal distance over which deﬂ  ection occurs, mm (in).  

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12. As torque  is increased, the tube deﬂ  ects by twisting, which is a shear strain for this geometry. This shear plane area can be calculated as  

$$
A_{s}=\frac{t_{o}w}{\sin\!\phi}
$$  

The shear stress in Equation (20.7) represents the level of stress required to per- form the machining operation. Therefore, this stress is equal to the shear strength of  the work material  $(\tau=S)$ ) under the conditions at which cutting occurs.  

Vector addition of the two force components  $F_{s}$  and  $F_{n}$  yields the resultant force  $R^{\prime}$ . In order for the forces acting on the chip to balance, this resultant  $R^{\prime}$  must be  equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and collinear with the resultant  $R$ .  

None of the four force components  $F,N,F_{s}$ , and $F_{n}$  can be directly measured  in a machining operation, because the directions in which they are applied vary  with different tool geometries and cutting conditions. However, it is possible  for the cutting tool to be instrumented using a force measuring device called a  dynamometer, so that two additional force components acting against the tool  can be directly measured: cutting force and thrust force. The  cutting force   $F_{c}$  is  in the direction of cutting, the same direction as the cutting speed  $\nu$ , and the  thrust force   $F_{t}$  is perpendicular to the cutting force and is associated with the  chip thickness before the cut $t_{o}$ . The cutting force and thrust force are shown in  Figure 20.10(b) together with their resultant force  $R^{\prime\prime}$ . The respective directions  of these forces are known, so the force transducers in the dynamometer can be  aligned accordingly.  

Equations can be derived to relate the four force components that cannot be meas- ured to the two forces that can be measured. Using the force diagram in Figure 20.11,  the following trigonometric relationships can be derived:  

If cutting force and thrust force are known, these four equations can be used to  calculate estimates of shear force, friction force, and normal force to friction. Based  on these force estimates, shear stress and coefﬁ  cient of friction can be determined.  

Note that in the special case of orthogonal cutting when the rake angle  $\alpha\,=\,0$ ,  Equations (20.9) and (20.10) reduce to  $\boldsymbol{F}=\boldsymbol{F}_{\iota}$  and $N=F_{c}$ , respectively. Thus, in this  special case, friction force and its normal force could be directly measured by the  dynamometer.  

# Example 20.2  Shear stress in  machining  

Suppose in Example 20.1 that cutting force and thrust force are measured dur- ing an orthogonal cutting operation: $F_{c}=1559\,\mathrm{N}$  and $F_{t}=1271$  N. The width  of the orthogonal cutting operation $w=3.0\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Based on these data, deter- mine the shear strength of the work material.  

Solution:  From Example 20.1, rake angle $\alpha=10^{\circ}$ , and shear plane angle $\phi=$ $25.4^{\circ}$ . Shear force can be computed from Equation (20.11):  

$$
F_{s}=1559\cos25.4-1271\sin25.4=863\:\mathrm{N}
$$  

The shear plane area is given by Equation (20.8):  

$$
A_{s}={\frac{(0.5)(3.0)}{\sin25.4}}=3.497\:\mathrm{mm}^{2}
$$  

Thus the shear stress, which equals the shear strength of the work material, is  

$$
\tau=S={\frac{863}{3.497}}=247\;\mathrm{N}/\mathrm{mm}^{2}=247\;\mathrm{MPa}
$$  

This example demonstrates that cutting force and thrust force are related to the  shear strength of the work material. The relationships can be established in a more  direct way.

For a tested hardness of HB = 182, TS = 500(182) = 91,000 lb/in2.","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN) using the given values and then estimate the tensile strength of the steel.

### Part (a): Determine the Brinell Hardness Number

The formula to calculate the Brinell Hardness Number is:

\[ \text{BHN} = \frac{2P}{\pi D(D - \sqrt{D^2 - d^2})} \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the load applied (in kgf).
- \( D \) is the diameter of the indenter (in mm).
- \( d \) is the diameter of the indentation (in mm).

Given:
- \( P = 1500 \) kg (since Brinell test load is often given in kgf, we assume it is kgf here).
- \( D = 10 \) mm.
- \( d = 3.2 \) mm.

Plug these values into the formula:

\[ \text{BHN} = \frac{2 \times 1500}{\pi \times 10 \left(10 - \sqrt{10^2 - 3.2^2}\right)} \]

First, calculate \( \sqrt{10^2 - 3.2^2} \):

1. \( D^2 = 10^2 = 100 \)
2. \( d^2 = 3.2^2 = 10.24 \)
3. \( D^2 - d^2 = 100 - 10.24 = 89.76 \)
4. \( \sqrt{89.76} \approx 9.474 \)

Now substitute back into the BHN formula:

\[ D - \sqrt{D^2 - d^2} = 10 - 9.474 = 0.526 \]

\[ \text{BHN} = \frac{2 \times 1500}{\pi \times 10 \times 0.526} \]

\[ \text{BHN} \approx \frac{3000}{3.1416 \times 5.26} \]

\[ \text{BHN} \approx \frac{3000}{16.52} \]

\[ \text{BHN} \approx 181.65 \]

So, the Brinell Hardness Number is approximately **182**.

### Part (b): Estimate the Tensile Strength of the Steel

The tensile strength \( \sigma_t \) of steel can be estimated from the Brinell Hardness Number using an empirical relationship:

\[ \sigma_t \approx \text{BHN} \times 3.45 \]

Substitute BHN into the equation:

\[ \sigma_t \approx 182 \times 3.45 \]

\[ \sigma_t \approx 627.9 \, \text{MPa} \]

So, the estimated tensile strength of the steel is approximately **628 MPa**.

"One of the inspectors in the quality control department has frequently used the Brinell and Rockwell hardness tests, for which equipment is available in the company. He claims that all hardness tests are based on the same principle as the Brinell test, which is that hardness is always measured as the applied load divided by the area of the impressions made by an indentor. (a) Is he correct? (b) If not, what are some of the other principles involved in hardness testing, and what are the associated tests?","Solution: (a) No, the claim is not correct. Not all hardness tests are based on the applied load divided by area, but many of them are. (b) Some of the other hardness tests and operating principles include: (1) Rockwell hardness test, which measures the depth of indentation of a cone resulting from an applied load; (2) Scleroscope, which measures the rebound height of a hammer dropped from a certain distance against a surface specimen; and (3) Durometer, which measures elastic deformation by pressing an indentor into the surface of rubber and similar soft materials.","Let's address the question about hardness tests and assess the inspector's claim through a detailed explanation.

### (a) Is the inspector correct?

The inspector claims that all hardness tests are based on the same principle as the Brinell test, which involves measuring hardness as the applied load divided by the area of the impression made by an indentor. This statement is not entirely correct. While the Brinell test uses this principle, not all hardness tests follow the same methodology. Different hardness tests have different approaches to measuring hardness, some of which do not involve direct calculation of the impression area.

### (b) If not, what are some of the other principles involved in hardness testing, and what are the associated tests?

Here are some other hardness tests and the principles they use:

1. **Rockwell Hardness Test:**
   - **Principle:** The Rockwell test measures the depth of penetration of an indentor under a large load compared to the penetration made by a preload. Instead of calculating the area of the impression, the Rockwell test considers the depth difference between two loads: a preliminary minor load and a larger major load.
   - **Procedure:** The initial minor load is applied, setting a reference point. A major load is then applied, increasing the penetration depth. After removing the major load, the depth of the residual indentation is measured as hardness.
   - **Associated Scale:** The Rockwell test has various scales (e.g., A, B, C) determined by different combinations of loads and indentors.

2. **Vickers Hardness Test:**
   - **Principle:** Similar to the Brinell test in using the applied load over the impression's surface area, but it uses a diamond pyramid indenter with a square base. The area calculation is based on the diagonals of the indentation left on the material.
   - **Procedure:** The indentor is applied to the material under a specified force. The diagonals of the resulting indentation are measured, and the hardness value is calculated using the formula, taking the average of the two diagonal lengths.
  
3. **Knoop Hardness Test:**
   - **Principle:** Measures the indentation depth like the Rockwell, but involves an elongated, diamond-shaped impression.
   - **Applications:** This test is ideal for very small or thin materials and coatings due to the testing's non-destructive nature and precision.

4. **Mohs Hardness Test:**
   - **Principle:** A qualitative test based on the ability of a material to scratch another material.
   - **Scale:** Ranges from 1 (talc) to 10 (diamond), each level corresponding to a mineral's scratch resistance relative to others.

### Conclusion:

The inspector's statement is incorrect because not all hardness tests use the applied load divided by the area of the impression. Different tests have unique methodologies, such as measuring indentation depth or comparing scratch resistance. These help determine material properties under varying conditions and serve specific industrial needs.

**Final Answer:**
(a) No, the inspector is not correct.
(b) Other principles include measuring indentation depth (Rockwell), using specific indentors like pyramids (Vickers), and the scratch method (Mohs). Tests based on these principles include Rockwell, Vickers, Knoop, and Mohs hardness tests.

"A batch of annealed steel has just been received from the vendor. It is supposed to have a tensile strength in the range 60,000 -70,000 lb/in2. A Brinell hardness test in the receiving department yields a value of HB = 118. (a) Does the steel meet the specification on tensile strength?","Solution: (a) TS = 500(HB) = 500(118) = 59,000 lb/in2. This lies outside the specified range of 60,000 to 70,000 lb/in2. However, from a legal standpoint, it is unlikely that the batch can be rejected on the basis of its measured Brinell hardness number without using an actual tensile test to measure TS. The formula for converting from Brinell hardness number to tensile strength is only an approximating equation. ","To determine if the annealed steel meets the tensile strength specification, we can use the empirical relationship between Brinell hardness (HB) and tensile strength (\(\sigma_t\)) known in the field of materials science and metallurgy. The relationship can be approximately expressed as:

\[
\sigma_t = c \times \text{HB}
\]

where \(c\) is a conversion constant. For carbon steels, a commonly used approximate value for \(c\) is between 500 and 550. For this problem, let's use \(c = 500\) for simplicity, which is a typical conversion factor for steel.

Given:
- Brinell hardness, HB = 118

Using the conversion formula:

\[
\sigma_t = 500 \times 118 = 59,000 \text{ lb/in}^2
\]

Now, we compare the calculated tensile strength to the specified range of 60,000 - 70,000 lb/in².

\[
59,000 \text{ lb/in}^2 < 60,000 \text{ lb/in}^2

Therefore, the calculated tensile strength of 59,000 lb/in² is below the lower limit of the specified range.

The Brinell hardness number (HB) can be related to the tensile strength (\( \sigma_t \)) of the material using the following empirical formula:

\[ \sigma_t \approx 500 \times \text{HB} \]

This relationship is a rough approximation and is generally used for carbon steels and similar materials. The tensile strength is often similar in magnitude to the ultimate tensile strength of the material.

For yield strength (\( \sigma_y \)), another empirical relationship can be used. Yield strength is usually a smaller proportion of the tensile strength:

\[ \sigma_y \approx 0.5 \times \sigma_t \]

Using these relationships, we can estimate the yield strength of the material given the Brinell hardness number HB = 118.

**Step-by-step Calculation:**

1. **Calculate the Tensile Strength (\( \sigma_t \)):**

   Using the given Brinell hardness number:
   \[ \sigma_t \approx 500 \times 118 = 59,000 \text{ lb/in}^2 \]

2. **Estimate the Yield Strength (\( \sigma_y \)):**

   Using the relation between yield strength and tensile strength:
   \[ \sigma_y \approx 0.5 \times 59,000 = 29,500 \text{ lb/in}^2 \]

So, the estimated yield strength of the steel is approximately 29,500 lb/in².

- \(\tau\) is the shear stress, in pascals (Pa),
- \(\mu\) is the dynamic viscosity (or coefficient of viscosity), in pascal-seconds (Pa·s),

If the velocity gradient in the space between the surfaces is constant, determine the viscosity of the fluid.",Solution: Shear rate = (25 in/sec)/(0.5 in) = 50 sec-1 K = (0.3 lb/in2)/(50 sec-1) = 0.0006 lb-sec/in2.,"To determine the viscosity of the fluid, we need to use the relationship defined by Newton's law of viscosity. This law states that the shear stress (\(\tau\)) between fluid layers is proportional to the velocity gradient (\(\frac{dv}{dy}\)) perpendicular to the layers, with viscosity (\(\mu\)) being the constant of proportionality. The formula is expressed as:

\[
\tau = \mu \cdot \frac{dv}{dy}

Where:
- \(\tau\) is the shear stress (in lb/in\(^2\)),
- \(\mu\) is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid,
- \(\frac{dv}{dy}\) is the velocity gradient (in sec\(^{-1}\)).

Given:
- \(\tau = 0.3\) lb/in\(^2\),
- The velocity difference (\(dv\)) across the fluid layer is \(25\) in/sec,
- The distance between the surfaces (\(dy\)) is \(0.5\) in,
- The velocity gradient \(\frac{dv}{dy}\) can be calculated as the change in velocity (\(dv\)) over the distance (\(dy\)).

First, calculate the velocity gradient:

\[
\frac{dv}{dy} = \frac{25 \, \text{in/sec}}{0.5 \, \text{in}} = 50 \, \text{sec}^{-1}
\]

Next, solve for viscosity \(\mu\) using Newton's law of viscosity:

\[
0.3 \, \text{lb/in}^2 = \mu \cdot 50 \, \text{sec}^{-1}
\]

Rearranging the equation to solve for \(\mu\):

\[
\mu = \frac{0.3 \, \text{lb/in}^2}{50 \, \text{sec}^{-1}}

\[
\mu = 0.006 \, \text{lb} \cdot \text{sec/in}^2

A 125.0-mm-diameter shaft rotates inside a stationary bushing whose inside diameter = 125.6 mm and length = 50.0 mm. In the clearance between the shaft and the bushing is a lubricating oil whose viscosity = 0.14 Pa-s. The shaft rotates at a velocity of 400 rev/min; this speed and the action of the oil are sufficient to keep the shaft centered inside the bushing. Determine the magnitude of the torque due to viscosity that acts to resist the rotation of the shaft.,Solution: Bushing internal bearing area A = (125.6)^2 x 50/4 = 19729.6 mm2 = 19729.2(10^-6) m2 d = (125.6 -125)/2 = 0.3 mm v = (125pi mm/rev)(400 rev/min)(1 min/60 sec) = 2618.0 mm/s Shear rate = 2618/0.3 = 8726.6 s-1     W = (0.14)(8726.6) = 1221.7 Pa = 1221.7 N/mm2 Force on surface between shaft and bushing = (1221.7 N/mm2)(19729.2(10^-6)) = 24.1 N Torque T = 24.1 N x 125/2 mm = 1506.4 N-mm = 1.506 N-m,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the torque due to the viscous friction of the lubricating oil between the rotating shaft and the stationary bushing. This setup is essentially a classic problem in fluid mechanics often referred to as a ""journal bearing"" problem.

### Steps to Solution:

1. **Convert Units:**
   - Diameter of the shaft, \(D = 125.0 \text{ mm} = 0.1250 \text{ m}\).
   - Radius of the shaft, \(r = \frac{D}{2} = 0.0625 \text{ m}\).
   - Inside diameter of the bushing, \(D_{\text{bushing}} = 125.6 \text{ mm} = 0.1256 \text{ m}\).
   - Length of the bushing, \(L = 50.0 \text{ mm} = 0.050 \text{ m}\).
   - Clearance (radius difference) between the shaft and bushing:
     \[
     c = \frac{D_{\text{bushing}} - D}{2} = \frac{0.1256 - 0.1250}{2} = 0.0003 \text{ m}
     \]
   - Angular velocity of the shaft:
     \[
     N = 400 \text{ rev/min} = \frac{400 \times 2\pi}{60} \text{ rad/s} \approx 41.89 \text{ rad/s}
     \]

2. **Shear Stress Calculation:**
   - The shear stress \(\tau\) on the shaft due to the oil viscosity is calculated using:
     \[
     \tau = \eta \cdot \frac{dv}{dy}
     \]
     where \(\eta = 0.14 \text{ Pa-s}\) is the dynamic viscosity, and \(\frac{dv}{dy}\) is the velocity gradient across the oil film.
   - Assuming linear velocity profile:
     \[
     \frac{dv}{dy} = \frac{\text{Relative velocity between shaft and bushing}}{\text{Oil film thickness}}
     \]
     Since the shaft is centered, the relative tangential velocity at the surface of the shaft is:
     \[
     v = r \cdot \omega = 0.0625 \times 41.89 \approx 2.618 \text{ m/s}
     \]
   - The oil film thickness is effectively the clearance \(c\):
     \[
     \frac{dv}{dy} = \frac{2.618}{0.0003} \approx 8726.67 \text{ s}^{-1}
     \]
   - Thus, shear stress \(\tau\) is:
     \[
     \tau = 0.14 \times 8726.67 \approx 1222.13 \text{ Pa}
     \]

3. **Torque Calculation:**
   - The torque \(T\) due to shear stress is computed over the cylindrical area of the shaft:
     \[
     T = \tau \cdot A \cdot r
     \]
     where \(A\) is the cylindrical area in contact with the oil: 
     \[
     A = 2\pi rL = 2\pi \times 0.0625 \times 0.050 \approx 0.01964 \text{ m}^2
     \]
   - Therefore, torque \(T\) is:
     \[
     T = 1222.13 \cdot 0.01964 \cdot 0.0625 \approx 1.501 \text{ Nm}
     \]

This involves considering the thermal expansion properties of the material the shaft is made of. 

Since the context refers to Table 4.1, we are missing specific values, particularly the coefficient of linear thermal expansion (\(\alpha\)) for the shaft's material. However, I will guide you through the general approach to solve such a problem, and please substitute the correct values from the data source you have.

### Steps to Solve the Problem:
1. **Understand the Problem**: 
   - Initial diameter of the shaft = 25.00 mm
   - Desired diameter = 24.98 mm
   
   Difference in diameter (shrinkage required):
   \[
   \Delta D = 25.00 \, \text{mm} - 24.98 \, \text{mm} = 0.02 \, \text{mm}
   \]

2. **Use the Linear Thermal Expansion Formula**:
   \[
   \Delta L = \alpha \times L_0 \times \Delta T
   \]

   - \(\Delta L\) is the change in length (or diameter in this case, which is 0.02 mm).
   - \(\alpha\) is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion (generally given in \(\text{°C}^{-1}\)).
   - \(L_0\) is the original length/diameter, which is 25.00 mm.
   - \(\Delta T\) is the change in temperature we need to find.

3. **Rearrange the Formula to Solve for \(\Delta T\)**:
   \[
   \Delta T = \frac{\Delta D}{\alpha \times L_0}
   \]

4. **Calculate \(\Delta T\) (Insert the Known Values)**:
   - Substitute the necessary values:
   - If \(\alpha = \text{(value from Table 4.1)}\)

   \[
   \Delta T = \frac{0.02 \, \text{mm}}{\alpha \times 25.00 \, \text{mm}}
   \]

5. **Determine the Final Temperature**:
   - Initial temperature = 20°C
   - Final temperature = Initial temperature - \(\Delta T\)

### Final Answer:
- **Note**: This answer is based on an assumed methodology because the necessary specific material property (\(\alpha\)) is unavailable. To complete the calculation, you must know the coefficient of linear thermal expansion for the shaft's material.

After calculating \(\Delta T\) using the correct value for \(\alpha\), you would subtract \(\Delta T\) from 20°C to find the temperature to which the shaft needs to be cooled.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,4.0,4.1
"Aluminum has a density of 2.70 g/cm3 at room temperature (20C). Determine its density at 650C, using data in Table 4.1 as a reference.","Solution: Assume a 1 cm3 cube, 1 cm on each side. From Table 4.1, a = 24(10^-6) mm/mm/C L2-L1=a L1(T2-T2). L2 = 1.0 + 24(10^-6)(1.0)(650 -20) = 1.01512 cm (L2 )^3 = (1.01512)^3 = 1.04605 cm3 Assume weight remains the same; thus U at 650C = 2.70/1.04605 = 2.581 g/cm3","To determine the density of aluminum at 650°C, we need to account for its thermal expansion as temperature increases from 20°C to 650°C.

The coefficient of thermal expansion for aluminum (from typical sources) is approximately \(23 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{per} \, ^\circ\text{C}\).

The formula for linear expansion is:

\[
\Delta L = L_0 \cdot \alpha \cdot \Delta T
\]

However, since density is related to volume and volume expands in three dimensions, we need the volumetric expansion coefficient, which is approximately three times the linear expansion coefficient (\(\beta = 3\alpha\)).

First, calculate the total volumetric expansion from 20°C to 650°C:

- \(\Delta T = 650°C - 20°C = 630°C\)
- \(\beta = 3 \times 23 \times 10^{-6} = 69 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{per} \, ^\circ\text{C}\)

The change in volume \( \Delta V \) relative to the original volume \( V_0 \) is:

\[
\frac{\Delta V}{V_0} = \beta \cdot \Delta T
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\frac{\Delta V}{V_0} = 69 \times 10^{-6} \times 630 = 0.04347
\]

This means the volume increases by 4.347%, or \( V = V_0 \times (1 + 0.04347) \).

Density relates inversely with volume, hence:

\[
\rho = \frac{\rho_0}{1 + \frac{\Delta V}{V_0}}
\]

Given the original density \( \rho_0 = 2.70 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \):

\[
\rho = \frac{2.70}{1 + 0.04347} = \frac{2.70}{1.04347} \approx 2.59 \, \text{g/cm}^3
\]

**Final Answer: The density of aluminum at 650°C is approximately 2.59 g/cm³.**","# TABLE  •  6.1   (continued): (f) Titanium.

as an ore because of its higher Ti content. In recovery of the metal from its ores, the  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  is converted to titanium tetrachloride  $\mathrm{(TiCl_{4})}$  by reacting the compound with  chlorine gas. This is followed by a sequence of distillation steps to remove impurities.  The  highly concentrated  $\mathrm{TiCl_{4}}$  is then reduced to metallic titanium by reaction with  magnesium; this is known as the  Kroll process . Sodium can also be used as a reduc-  ing agent. In either case, an inert atmosphere must be maintained to prevent $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ , $\mathbf{N}_{2}$ ,  or $\mathrm{H}_{2}$  from contaminating the Ti, owing to its chemical affinity for these gases. The  resulting metal is used to cast ingots of titanium and its alloys.  

Properties of Titanium  Ti’s coefficient of thermal expansion is relatively low  among metals. It is stiffer and stronger than aluminum, and it retains good strength  at elevated temperatures. Pure titanium is reactive, which presents problems in  processing, especially in the molten state. However, at room temperature it forms  a thin adherent oxide coating $\left(\mathrm{TiO}_{2}\right)$  that provides excellent corrosion resistance.  

These properties give rise to two principal application areas for titanium: (1) in  the commercially pure state, Ti is used for corrosion resistant components, such as  marine components and prosthetic implants; and (2) titanium alloys are used as  high-strength components in temperatures ranging from ambient to above  $550^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ $(1000^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ), especially where its excellent strength-to-weight ratio is exploited. These  latter applications include aircraft and missile components. Some of the alloying  elements used with titanium include aluminum, manganese, tin, and vanadium.

Aluminum Production  The principal aluminum ore is  bauxite , which consists  largely of hydrated aluminum oxide  $(\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}–\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O})$ ) and other oxides. Extraction of  the aluminum from bauxite can be summarized in three steps: (1) washing and  crushing the ore into fine powders; (2) the Bayer process, in which the bauxite is  converted to pure alumina  $\left(\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$ ; and (3) electrolysis, in which the alumina is  separated into aluminum and oxygen gas  $(\mathrm{O}_{2})$ . The  Bayer process , named after the  German chemist who developed it, involves solution of bauxite powders in aque-  ous caustic soda (NaOH) under pressure, followed by precipitation of pure $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ from solution.

Around 4000  B . C . E ., it was discovered that copper  

To the ancient Romans, the island of Cyprus was al-  most the only source of copper. They called the metal  aes cyprium  (ore of Cyprus). This was shortened to  Cyprium  and subsequently renamed  Cuprium . From  

Copper Production  In ancient times, copper was available in nature as a free  element. Today these natural deposits are more difficult to find, and copper is now  extracted from ores that are mostly sulfides, such as  chalcopyrite  $\left(\mathrm{CuFeS}_{2}\right)$ ). The ore  is crushed (Section 16.1.1), concentrated by flotation, and then  smelted  (melted or  fused, often with an associated chemical reaction to separate a metal from its ore).  The resulting copper is called  blister copper , which is between $98\%$  and $99\%$  pure.  Electrolysis is used to obtain higher purity levels suitable for commercial use.  

Properties and Designation Scheme  Pure copper has a distinctive reddish- pink  color, but its most distinguishing engineering property is its low electrical resistivity— one of the lowest of all elements. Because of this property, and its rela- tive abundance  in nature, commercially pure copper is widely used as an electrical conductor. (The  conductivity of copper decreases significantly as alloying elements are added.)  $\mathrm{Cu}$  is  also an excellent thermal conductor.

"With reference to Table 4.1, determine the increase in length of a steel bar whose length = 10.0 in, if the bar is heated from room temperature of 70F to 500F.",Solution: Increase = (6.7 x 10^-6 in/in/F)(10.0 in)(500F -70F) = 0.0288 in.,"To find the increase in length of a steel bar when heated, we use the formula for linear thermal expansion:

\[
L_{2} - L_{1} = a \cdot L_{1} \cdot (T_{2} - T_{1})
\]

where:
- \( L_{1} = 10.0 \) inches (initial length)
- \( T_{1} = 70^\circ F \) (initial temperature)
- \( T_{2} = 500^\circ F \) (final temperature)
- \( a = 6.5 \times 10^{-6} /^\circ F \) (coefficient of thermal expansion for steel, a typical value)

### Steps:

1. **Calculate the Change in Temperature \((T_{2} - T_{1})\):**

\[
T_{2} - T_{1} = 500^\circ F - 70^\circ F = 430^\circ F
\]

2. **Substitute the Values into the Expansion Formula:**

\[
L_{2} - L_{1} = 6.5 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 10.0 \cdot 430
\]

3. **Perform the Calculation:**

\[
L_{2} - L_{1} = 6.5 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 10.0 \cdot 430 = 0.02795 \text{ inches}
\]

### Final Answer:

The increase in length of the steel bar when heated from \(70^\circ F\) to \(500^\circ F\) is approximately \(0.02795\) inches.","The change in  length corresponding to a given temperature change is given by:  

$$
L_{2}-L_{1}=a L_{1}\left(T_{2}-T_{1}\right)
$$  

where $a=$   coefficient of thermal expansion, $^{\circ}\mathbf{C}^{\cdot1}(^{\circ}\mathbf{F}^{\cdot1})$ ; and $L_{1}$  and $L_{2}$  are lengths,  mm (in), corresponding, respectively, to temperatures $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2},\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\ (^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ .  

Values of coefficient of thermal expansion given in Table 4.1 suggest that it has  a linear relationship with temperature. This is only an approximation. Not only is  length affected by temperature, but the thermal expansion coefficient itself is also  affected. For some materials it increases with temperature; for other materials it  decreases. These changes are usually not significant enough to be of much concern,  and values like those in the table are quite useful in design calculations for the range  of temperatures contemplated in service. Changes in the coefficient are more sub-  stantial when the metal undergoes a phase transformation, such as from solid to  liquid, or from one crystal structure to another.  

In manufacturing operations, thermal expansion is put to good use in shrink fit  and expansion fit assemblies (Section 31.3), in which a part is heated to increase its  size or cooled to decrease its size to permit insertion into some other part. When the  part returns to ambient temperature, a tightly fitted assembly is obtained. Thermal  expansion can be a problem in heat treatment (Chapter 26) and welding (Section  29.6) because of thermal stresses that develop in the material during these processes.  

# 4.1.3  MELTING  CHARACTERISTICS  

For a pure element, the  melting point $T_{m}$   is the temperature at which the mate- rial  transforms from solid to liquid state. The reverse transformation, from liquid to  solid,  occurs at the same temperature and is called the  freezing point . For crystalline  elements,  such as metals, the melting and freezing temperatures are the same. A cer- tain  amount of heat energy, called the  heat of fusion , is required at this temperature to  accomplish the transformation from solid to liquid.  

Melting of a metal element at a specific temperature assumes equilibrium condi-  tions. Exceptions occur in nature; for example, when a molten metal is cooled, it may  remain in the liquid state below its freezing point if nucleation of crystals does not  initiate immediately. When this happens, the liquid is said to be  supercooled .  

There are other variations in the melting process—differences in the way melt-  ing occurs in different materials. For example, unlike pure metals, most metal alloys  do not have a single melting point. Instead, melting begins at a certain temperature,   called the  solidus , and continues as   the temperature increases until finally convert-  ing completely to the liquid state at a temperature called the  liquidus . Between the  two temperatures, the alloy is a mixture of solid and molten metals, the amounts of  each being inversely proportional to their relative distances from the liquidus and  solidus. Although most alloys behave in this way, exceptions are eutectic alloys that  

FIGURE 4.1  Changes  in volume per unit  weight (1/density) as a  function of temperature  for a hypothetical pure  metal, alloy, and glass;  all exhibiting similar  thermal expansion and  melting  characteristics.

melt (and freeze) at a single temperature. These issues are examined in the discus-  sion of phase diagrams in Chapter 6.  

Another difference in melting occurs with noncrystalline materials (glasses). In  these materials, there is a gradual transition from solid to liquid states. The solid  material gradually softens as temperature increases, finally becoming liquid at the  melting point. During softening, the material has a consistency of increasing plasticity  (increasingly like a fluid) as it gets closer to the melting point.  

These differences in melting characteristics among pure metals, alloys, and glass  are portrayed in Figure 4.1. These assembly methods are used to ﬁ  t gears, pulleys, sleeves,  and other components onto solid and hollow shafts.  

Various methods are used to heat and/or cool the work parts. Heating equip- ment includes torches, furnaces, electric resistance heaters, and electric induction  heaters. Cooling methods include conventional refrigeration, packing in dry ice,  and immersion in cold liquids, including liquid nitrogen. The resulting change in  diameter depends on the coefﬁ  cient of thermal expansion and the temperature  difference that is applied to the part. If it is assumed that the heating or cooling  has produced a uniform temperature throughout the work, then the change in di- ameter is given by  

$$
D_{2}\!-\!D_{1}=\alpha\,D_{1}(T_{2}\!-\!T_{1})
$$  

where $\alpha=$  the coefﬁ  cient of linear thermal expansion, $\mathrm{mm/mm\cdot^{\circ}C}$  (in/in- $\mathrm{\cdot^{\circ}F}$ ) for the  material (see Table 4.1);  $T_{2}=$  the temperature to which the parts have been heated  or cooled, $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $\mathrm{(^{\circ}F)}$ ;  $T_{1}=$  starting ambient temperature;  $D_{2}=$  diameter of the part at  $T_{2},\mathrm{mm}$ $D_{\scriptscriptstyle1}=$  diameter of the part at  $T_{1}$ .  

Equations (31.5) through (31.9) for computing interference pressures and  effective stresses can be used to determine the corresponding values for shrink and  expansion ﬁ  ts.

a second. When the power is turned off, the area, usually a narrow line as in the  ﬁ  gure, is quenched by heat transfer to the surrounding metal. Depth of the treated  area is around  $0.63\ \mathrm{mm}$  (0.025 in.); hardness depends on carbon content of the  steel and can range up to  $60\,\mathrm{HRC}$  [11].  

Electron beam  $(E B)$  heating  involves localized surface hardening of steel in  which the electron beam is focused onto a small area, resulting in rapid heat buildup.  Austenitizing temperatures can often be achieved in less than a second. When the  directed beam is removed, the heated area is immediately quenched and hardened  by heat transfer to the surrounding cold metal. A disadvantage of EB heating is  that best results are achieved when the process is performed in a vacuum. A special  vacuum chamber is needed, and time is required to draw the vacuum, thus slowing  production rates.  

Laser beam  $(L B)$  heating  uses a high-intensity beam of coherent light focused on a  small area. The beam is usually moved along a deﬁ  ned path on the work surface, caus- ing heating of the steel into the austenite region. When the beam is moved, the area  is immediately quenched by heat conduction to the surrounding metal.  Laser  is an  acronym for  l ight  a mpliﬁ  cation by  s timulated  e mission of  r adiation. The advantage of  LB over EB heating is that laser beams do not require a vacuum to achieve best results.  Energy density levels in EB and LB heating are lower than in cutting or welding.

#  Heating and Pouring  

To perform a casting operation, the metal must be heated to a temperature some- what above its melting point and then poured into the mold cavity to solidify. Several  aspects of these two steps are discussed in this section.  

# 10.2.1  HEATING THE METAL  

Heating furnaces of various kinds (Section 11.4.1) are used to heat the metal to a  molten temperature sufﬁ  cient for casting. The heat energy required is the sum of (1)  the heat to raise the temperature to the melting point, (2) the heat of fusion to con- vert it from solid to liquid, and (3) the heat to raise the molten metal to the desired  temperature for pouring. This can be expressed:  

$$
H=\rho\,V\{C_{s}\,(T_{m}-\,T_{o})+\,H_{f}+\,C_{l}\,(T_{p}\,-\,T_{m})\}
$$  

where  $H=$  total heat required to raise the temperature of the metal to the pour- ing temperature, J (Btu); $\rho=$  density,  $\mathrm{{g}/\mathrm{{cm}}^{3}}$   $\left(1\mathrm{b}\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{in}^{3}\right)$ ;  $C_{s}=$  weight speciﬁ  c heat for  the solid metal,  $\mathrm{J/g-C}$  (Btu/lbm-F);  $T_{m}=$  melting temperature of the metal, C (F);  $T_{o}=$  starting temperature—usually ambient,  $\mathrm{C}$  (F);  $H_{f}=$  heat of fusion,  $\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{g}$  ( $\mathrm{{'Bup/}}$ lbm);  $C_{1}=$  weight speciﬁ  c heat of the liquid metal, $\mathrm{J/g-C}$  (Btu/lbm-F);  $T_{p}=$  pouring  temperature, C (F); and  $V=$  volume of metal being heated, $\mathrm{cm}^{3}\left(\mathrm{in}^{3}\right)$ .  

# Example 10.1  Heating metal  for casting  

One cubic meter of a certain eutectic alloy is heated in a crucible from room  temperature to $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  above its melting point for casting. The alloy’s density $=$ $7.5\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , melting point $=800^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , speciﬁ  c heat $=0.33\;\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{g}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  in the solid state  and $0.29\,\mathrm{J/g^{\circ}C}$  in the liquid state; and heat of fusion $=160\,\mathrm{J/g}$ . How much heat  energy must be added to accomplish the heating, assuming no losses?  

Solution :  Assume ambient temperature in the foundry $=25^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and that the  density of the liquid and solid states of the metal are the same. Noting that one  $\mathsf{m}^{3}=10^{6}\,\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , and substituting the property values into Equation (10.1),  

$H=(7.5)\,(10^{6})\{0.33(800-25)+160+0.29\,(100)\}=3335(10^{6})\,\mathrm{J}$ The above equation is of conceptual value, but its computational value is limited,  

notwithstanding the calculation in Example 10.1. Use of Equation (10.1) is com- plicated by the following factors: (1) Speciﬁ  c heat and other thermal properties of  a solid metal vary with temperature, especially if the metal undergoes a change of  phase during heating. (2) A metal’s speciﬁ  c heat may be different in the solid and  liquid states. Noting that one  $\mathsf{m}^{3}=10^{6}\,\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , and substituting the property values into Equation (10.1),  

$H=(7.5)\,(10^{6})\{0.33(800-25)+160+0.29\,(100)\}=3335(10^{6})\,\mathrm{J}$ The above equation is of conceptual value, but its computational value is limited,  

notwithstanding the calculation in Example 10.1. Use of Equation (10.1) is com- plicated by the following factors: (1) Speciﬁ  c heat and other thermal properties of  a solid metal vary with temperature, especially if the metal undergoes a change of  phase during heating. (2) A metal’s speciﬁ  c heat may be different in the solid and  liquid states. (3) Most casting metals are alloys, and most alloys melt over a tem- perature range between a solidus and liquidus rather than at a single melting point;  thus, the heat of fusion cannot be applied so simply as indicated above. (4) The  property values required in the equation for a particular alloy are not readily avail- able in most cases. (5) There are signiﬁ  cant heat losses to the environment during  heating.  

# 10.2.2  POURING THE MOLTEN METAL  

After heating, the metal is ready for pouring. Introduction of molten metal into the  mold, including its ﬂ  ow through the gating system and into the cavity, is a critical  step in the casting process. For this step to be successful, the metal must ﬂ  ow into  all regions of the mold before solidifying. Factors affecting the pouring operation  include pouring temperature, pouring rate, and turbulence.  

The  pouring temperature  is the temperature of the molten metal as it is intro- duced into the mold. What is important here is the difference between the tempera- ture at pouring and the temperature at which freezing begins (the melting point for  a pure metal or the liquidus temperature for an alloy). This temperature difference is  sometimes referred to as the  superheat . This term is also used for the amount of heat  that must be removed from the molten metal between pouring and when solidiﬁ  ca- tion commences [7].  

Pouring rate  refers to the volumetric rate at which the molten metal is poured  into the mold. If the rate is too slow, the metal will chill and freeze before ﬁ  lling the  cavity. If the pouring rate is excessive, turbulence can become a serious problem.  Turbulence  in ﬂ  uid ﬂ  ow is characterized by erratic variations in the magnitude and  direction of the velocity throughout the ﬂ  uid. The ﬂ  ow is agitated and irregular  rather than smooth and streamlined, as in laminar ﬂ  ow. Turbulent ﬂ  ow should be  avoided during pouring for several reasons. It tends to accelerate the formation  of metal oxides that can become entrapped during solidiﬁ  cation, thus degrading  the quality of the casting. Turbulence also aggravates  mold erosion , the gradual  wearing away of the mold surfaces due to impact of the ﬂ  owing molten metal.  The densities of most molten metals are much higher than water and other ﬂ  uids  normally encountered. These molten metals are also much more chemically reac- tive than at room temperature. Consequently, the wear caused by the ﬂ  ow of these  metals in the mold is signiﬁ  cant, especially under turbulent conditions. Erosion is  especially serious when it occurs in the main cavity because the geometry of the  cast part is affected.  

# 10.2.3  ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF POURING  

There are several relationships that govern the ﬂ  ow of liquid metal through  the gating system and into the mold. An important relationship is  Bernoulli’s  theorem , which states that the sum of the energies (head, pressure, kinetic, and  friction) at any two points in a ﬂ  owing liquid are equal. # 28.3.2  HEAT BALANCE IN FUSION WELDING  

The quantity of heat required to melt a given volume of metal depends on (1) the  heat to raise the temperature of the solid metal to its melting point, which depends  on the metal’s volumetric speciﬁ  c heat, (2) the melting point of the metal, and (3)  the heat to transform the metal from solid to liquid phase at the melting point, which  depends on the metal’s heat of fusion. To a reasonable approximation, this quantity  of heat can be estimated by the following equation [5]:  

$$
U_{m}=K T_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}
$$  

where  $U_{m}=$  the unit energy for melting (i.e., the quantity of heat required to melt a  unit volume of metal starting from room temperature), $\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{mm}^{3}\left(\mathrm{Btu}/\mathrm{in}^{3}\right)$ ;  $T_{m}=$ melt- ing point of the metal on an absolute temperature scale, $^{\circ}\mathrm{K}\left(^{\circ}\mathrm{R}\right)$ ; and  $K=$  constant  whose value is $3.33\times10^{-6}$  when the Kelvin scale is used (and  $K=1.467\times10^{-5}$  for  the Rankine temperature scale). Absolute melting temperatures for selected metals  are presented in Table 28.2.  

Not all of the energy generated at the heat source is used to melt the weld metal.  There are two heat transfer mechanisms at work, both of which reduce the amount  of generated heat that is used by the welding process. The situation is depicted in  Figure 28.8. The ﬁ  rst mechanism involves the transfer of heat between the heat source  and the surface of the work. This process has a certain  heat transfer factor $f_{1}$ , deﬁ  ned as  the ratio of the actual heat received by the workpiece divided by the total heat gener- ated at the source. The second mechanism involves the conduction of heat away from  the weld area to be dissipated throughout the work metal, so that only a portion of the  heat transferred to the surface is available for melting. This  melting factor $f_{2}$  is the pro- portion of heat received at the work surface that can be used for melting. The combined  effect of these two factors is to reduce the heat energy available for welding as follows:  

$$
H_{w}=f_{1}f_{2}H
$$

where $H_{w}\!=$  net heat available for welding, J (Btu), $f_{1}=$  heat transfer factor, $f_{2}=$  the  melting factor, and $H=$  the total heat generated by the welding process, J (Btu).  

The factors $f_{1}$  and $f_{2}$  range in value between zero and one. It is appropriate to  separate $f_{1}$  and $f_{2}$  in concept, even though they act in concert during the welding  process. The heat transfer factor $f_{1}$  is determined largely by the welding process and  the capacity to convert the power source (e.g., electrical energy) into usable heat at  the work surface. Arc-welding processes are relatively efﬁ  cient in this regard, while  oxyfuel gas-welding processes are relatively inefﬁ  cient.  

The melting factor $f_{2}$  depends on the welding process, but it is also inﬂ  uenced  by the thermal properties of the metal, joint conﬁ  guration, and work thickness.  Metals with high thermal conductivity, such as aluminum and copper, present a  problem in welding because of the rapid dissipation of heat away from the heat  contact area. The problem is exacerbated by welding heat sources with low energy

What is the resistance R of a length of copper wire whose length = 10 m and whose diameter = 0.10 mm? Use Table 4.3 as a reference.,"Solution: R = rL/A, A = pi(0.1)^2/4 = 0.007854 mm2 = 0.007854(10^-6) m2 From Table 4.3, r = 1.7 x 10^-8 -m2/m  R = (1.7 x 10^-8  ohm-m2/m)(10 m)/( 0.007854(10^-6) m2) = 2164.5(10^-2) : = 21.65 ohm","To find the resistance \( R \) of a length of copper wire, we use the formula for resistance in terms of resistivity:

\[
R = \rho \frac{L}{A}
\]

where:
- \( \rho \) is the resistivity of copper.
- \( L \) is the length of the wire.
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the wire.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Find the resistivity (\(\rho\)) of copper**:
   - The typical resistivity of copper is \( 1.68 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \).

2. **Convert diameter to radius and find the cross-sectional area (A)**:
   - Diameter of the wire = 0.10 mm = 0.10 \times 10^{-3} m = 0.0001 m.
   - Radius \( r = \frac{0.0001}{2} = 0.00005 \, \text{m} \).
   - Use the formula for the area of a circle, \( A = \pi r^2 \):

   \[
   A = \pi (0.00005)^2 = \pi \times 0.0000000025 = 7.85 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}^2
   \]

3. **Plug values into the resistance formula**:
   - Length \( L = 10 \, \text{m} \).
   - Calculate \( R \):

   \[
   R = 1.68 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \times \frac{10}{7.85 \times 10^{-9}} = 0.0214 \, \Omega
   \]

### Final Answer

The resistance \( R \) of a 10 m long copper wire with a diameter of 0.10 mm is approximately \( 0.0214 \, \Omega \).","This can be expressed  by the equation

FIGURE 29.12  Resistance welding  (RW), showing the  components in  spot welding, the  predominant process in  the RW group.  

The current used in resistance welding operations is very high (5000–20,000 A,  typically), although voltage is relatively low (usually below  $10\,\mathrm{V}$ ). The duration $t$  of  the current is short in most processes, perhaps lasting 0.1 to  $0.4~\mathrm{s}$  in a typical spot- welding operation.  

The reason why such a high current is used in RW is because (1) the squared term  in Equation (29.3) ampliﬁ  es the effect of current, and (2) the resistance is very low  (around  $0.0001\;\Omega$ ). Resistance in the welding circuit is the sum of (1) resistance of  the electrodes, (2) resistances of the work parts, (3) contact resistances between elec- trodes and work parts, and (4) contact resistance of the faying surfaces. Thus, heat  is generated in all of these regions of electrical resistance. The ideal situation is for  the faying surfaces to be the largest resistance in the sum, because this is the desired  location of the weld. The resistance of the electrodes is minimized by using metals  with very low resistivities, such as copper. Also, the electrodes are often water cooled  to dissipate the heat that is generated there. The work part resistances are a function  of the resistivities of the base metals and the part thicknesses. The contact resist- ances between the electrodes and the parts are determined by the contact areas (i.e.,  size and shape of the electrode) and the condition of the surfaces (e.g., cleanliness  of the work surfaces and scale on the electrode). Finally, the resistance at the faying  surfaces depends on surface ﬁ  nish, cleanliness, contact area, and pressure. No paint,  oil, dirt, or other contaminants should be present to separate the contacting surfaces.  

# Example 29.2  Resistance  welding  

A resistance spot-welding operation performed on two pieces of $2.5\mathrm{-mm}$ -thick  sheet steel uses 12,000 amps for a 0.20-s duration. The electrodes are  $6\,\mathrm{mm}$  in  diameter at the contacting surfaces. Resistance is assumed to be $0.0001\;\Omega$ , and  the resulting weld nugget $6\:\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter and averages $3\:\mathrm{mm}$  in thickness.  The unit melting energy for the metal  $U_{m}=12.0\:\mathrm{J/mm}^{3}$ . What portion of the  heat generated was used to form the weld nugget, and what portion was dis- sipated into the work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air?  

Solution:   The heat generated in the operation is given by Equation (29.3) as.  

$$
H=(12,\!000)^{2}(0.0001)(0.2)=2880\,\mathrm{J}
$$  

The volume of the weld nugget (assumed disc-shaped) is  $\nu=3.0\frac{\pi(6)^{2}}{4}=$ $84.8\;\mathrm{mm}^{3}$ .  

The heat required to melt this volume of metal is  $H w=84.8(12.0)=\mathbf{1018\,J}$ .   The remaining heat,  $\begin{array}{r}{2880{-}1018=1862\;\mathbf{J}}\end{array}$   $(64.7\%$  of the total), is lost into the  work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air. In effect, this loss represents  the combined effect of the heat transfer factor $f_{1}$  and melting factor $f_{2}$   (Section 28.3.2). The heat required to melt this volume of metal is  $H w=84.8(12.0)=\mathbf{1018\,J}$ .   The remaining heat,  $\begin{array}{r}{2880{-}1018=1862\;\mathbf{J}}\end{array}$   $(64.7\%$  of the total), is lost into the  work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air. In effect, this loss represents  the combined effect of the heat transfer factor $f_{1}$  and melting factor $f_{2}$   (Section 28.3.2).  

Success in resistance welding depends on pressure as well as heat. The principal  functions of pressure in RW are to (1) force contact between the electrodes and  the work parts and between the two work surfaces prior to applying current, and  (2) press the faying surfaces together to accomplish coalescence when the proper  welding temperature has been reached.  

General advantages of resistance welding include (1) no ﬁ  ller metal is re- quired, (2) high production rates are possible, (3) lends itself to mechanization and  automation, (4) operator skill level is lower than that required for arc welding, and  (5) good repeatability and reliability. Drawbacks are (1) equipment cost is high— usually much higher than most arc-welding operations, and (2) types of joints that  can be welded are limited to lap joints for most RW processes.  

# 29.2.2  RESISTANCE-WELDING PROCESSES  

The resistance-welding processes of most commercial importance are spot, seam,  and projection welding.  

Resistance Spot Welding  Resistance spot welding is by far the predominant  process in this group. It is widely used in mass production of automobiles, appliances,  metal furniture, and other products made of sheet metal. If one considers that a  typical car body has approximately 10,000 individual spot welds, and that the annual  production of automobiles throughout the world is measured in tens of millions of  units, the economic importance of resistance spot welding can be appreciated.  

Resistance spot welding  (RSW) is an RW process in which fusion of the faying  surfaces of a lap joint is achieved at one location by opposing electrodes. The process  is used to join sheet-metal parts of thickness  $3~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.125 in) or less, using a series  of spot welds, in situations where an airtight assembly is not required. The size and  shape of the weld spot is determined by the electrode tip, the most common elec- trode shape being round, but hexagonal, square, and other shapes are also used. The  resulting weld nugget is typically 5 to  $10\;\mathrm{mm}\;(0.2–0.4\;\mathrm{in})$  in diameter, with a heat- affected zone extending slightly beyond the nugget into the base metals. If the weld  is made properly, its strength will be comparable to that of the surrounding metal.  The steps in a spot welding cycle are depicted in Figure 29.13.

FIGURE 29.13  (a)  Steps in a resistance  spot-welding (RSW)  cycle, and (b) plot of  squeezing force and  current during cycle.  The sequence is: (1)  parts inserted between  open electrodes, (2)  electrodes close and  force is applied, (3)  weld time—current is  switched on, (4) cur- rent is turned off but  force is maintained or  increased (a reduced  current is sometimes  applied near the end of  this step for stress re- lief in the weld region),  and (5) electrodes are  opened, and the welded  assembly is removed.

Materials used for RSW electrodes consist of two main groups: (1) copper-based  alloys and (2) refractory metal compositions such as copper and tungsten combina- tions. The second group is noted for superior wear resistance. As in most manufactur- ing processes, the tooling in spot welding gradually wears out as it is used. The units of  $R_{H w}$  are watts (current multiplied by voltage), which equal  J/sec. This can be converted to Btu/sec by recalling that $1{\mathrm{~Bun}}=1055{\mathrm{~J}},$ , and thus 1  $\mathrm{Blu/sec}=1055$  watts.  

# Example 29.1  Power in arc  welding  

A gas tungsten arc welding operation is performed at a current of $300\,\mathrm{A}$  and  voltage of $20\,\mathrm{V}.$  The melting factor $f_{2}=0.5$ , and the unit melting energy for the  metal  $U_{m}=10\:\mathrm{J/mm^{3}}$ . Determine (a) power in the operation, (b) rate of heat  generation at the weld, and (c) volume rate of metal welded.  

Solution:   (a) The power in this arc-welding operation is  

$$
P=I E=(300\,\mathrm{A})(20\,\mathrm{V})=\mathbf{6000}\,\mathbf{W}
$$  

(b) From Table 29.1, the heat transfer factor $f_{1}=0.7$ . The rate of heat used for  welding is given by  

$$
R_{H w}=f_{1}\,f_{2}\,I\,E=(0.7)(0.5)(6000)=2100\,\mathrm{W}=2100\,\mathrm{J/s}
$$  

(c) The volume rate of metal welded is  

$R_{V W}=(2100\:\mathrm{J/s})/(10\:\mathrm{J/mm^{3}})=210\:\mathrm{mm^{3}/s}$  

# 29.1.2  AW PROCESSES—CONSUMABLE ELECTRODES  

A number of important arc-welding processes use consumable electrodes. These are  discussed in this section. Symbols for the welding processes are those used by the  American Welding Society.  

Shielded Metal Arc Welding   Shielded metal arc welding  (SMAW) is an AW  process that uses a consumable electrode consisting of a ﬁ  ller metal rod coated with  chemicals that provide ﬂ  ux and shielding. The process is illustrated in Figures 29.2  and 29.3. The welding stick (SMAW is sometimes called  stick welding ) is typically  225 to  $450\;\mathrm{mm}$  (9–18 in) long and 2.5 to  $9.5\;\mathrm{mm}$  (3/32–3/8 in) in diameter. The ﬁ  ller  metal used in the rod must be compatible with the metal to be welded, the com- position usually being very close to that of the base metal. The coating consists of  powdered cellulose (i.e., cotton and wood powders) mixed with oxides, carbonates,  and other ingredients, held together by a silicate binder. Metal powders are also  sometimes included in the coating to increase the amount of ﬁ  ller metal and to add  alloying elements. The heat of the welding process melts the coating to provide a  protective atmosphere and slag for the welding operation. It also helps to stabilize  the arc and regulate the rate at which the electrode melts.

During operation the bare metal end of the welding stick (opposite the welding  tip) is clamped in an electrode holder that is connected to the power source. The hold- er has an insulated handle so that it can be held and manipulated by a human welder.  Currents typically used in SMAW range between 30 and $300\,\mathrm{A}$  at voltages from 15 to  $45\,\mathrm{V}.$  Selection of the proper power parameters depends on the metals being welded,  electrode type and length, and depth of weld penetration required. Power supply,  connecting cables, and electrode holder can be bought for a few thousand dollars.  

Shielded metal arc welding is usually performed manually.

Since nickel is a metal, the resistivity would increase, causing the resistance to increase. This, in turn, would cause slightly more heat to be generated.","To solve this math problem, we need to determine the resistance of a 16 gauge nickel wire and understand how heating affects its resistance. However, since I don't have direct access to Table 4.3, I can provide a process based on typical reference information used in engineering.

### (a) Calculating the Resistance of the Wire

**Step 1: Gather Known Data**
- Diameter of the wire: 0.0508 inches.
- Length of the wire: 32.8 feet.
- Nickel has a typical resistivity of about \(10 \times 10^{-8} \ \Omega \cdot m\) (This value can vary, and it's typically found in reference tables, so please check the provided Table 4.3 for your specific case).

**Step 2: Convert Units**
- Convert the length from feet to meters: 
  \[
  32.8 \ \text{ft} \times 0.3048 \ \text{m/ft} = 9.99744 \ \text{m}
  \]
- Convert diameter from inches to meters (1 inch = 0.0254 meters):
  \[
  0.0508 \ \text{inches} \times 0.0254 \ \text{m/inch} = 0.00129032 \ \text{m}
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the Cross-Sectional Area of the Wire**
- The cross-sectional area \( A \) of a wire is given by the area of a circle \(\pi (r^2)\), where \( r \) is the radius in meters. The radius is half of the diameter:
  \[
  r = \frac{0.00129032}{2} = 0.00064516 \ \text{m}
  \]
  \[
  A = \pi \times (0.00064516)^2 \approx 1.3096 \times 10^{-6} \ \text{m}^2
  \]

**Step 4: Use the Resistivity Formula**
- The resistance \( R \) can be calculated using the formula:
  \[
  R = \rho \frac{L}{A}
  \]
  where \(\rho\) is the resistivity of the material in \(\Omega \cdot m\), \(L\) is the length in meters, and \(A\) is the area in square meters.
  \[
  R = 10 \times 10^{-8} \ \Omega \cdot m \left(\frac{9.99744 \ \text{m}}{1.3096 \times 10^{-6} \ \text{m}^2}\right) \approx 0.762 \ \Omega
  \]

### (b) Effect of Heating on Resistance

As a current passes through the wire, it causes the wire to heat up due to the collision of electrons, which increases the wire's temperature. This temperature increase affects the resistance of the wire. For most metals, the resistance increases with temperature. This relationship can be expressed using the temperature coefficient of resistance formula:

\[
R_T = R_0[1 + \alpha(T - T_0)]
\]

Where:
- \( R_T \) is the resistance at temperature \( T \).
- \( R_0 \) is the original resistance.
- \( \alpha \) is the temperature coefficient of resistance (for Nickel, approximately 0.006 \(\Omega/\Omega/°C\)).
- \( T \) is the final temperature.
- \( T_0 \) is the initial temperature.

In conclusion, the resistance of the wire will increase as it heats up due to the passage of current, following the linear model provided by the temperature coefficient of resistance.

### Final Answer:
(a) The resistance of the nickel wire is approximately \(0.762 \ \Omega\).

(b) The resistance of the wire increases with temperature due to the temperature coefficient of resistance, which for metals like Nickel, indicates increased resistance with higher temperatures.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,4.0,4.7

This is the 0.2 percent yield point. The maximum load of 168,000 N is reached at a gage length = 
64.2 mm. D. Determine (a) yield strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, and (c) tensile strength. ","Solution: (a) Y = 98,000/200 = 490 MPa. (b) s = E e Subtracting the 0.2% offset, e = (50.23 -50.0)/50.0 -0.002 = 0.0026 E = s/e = 490/0.0026 = 188.5 x 103 MPa.  (c) TS = 168,000/200 = 840 MPa.  ","To solve the problem, we need to calculate the yield strength, modulus of elasticity, and tensile strength of the material used in the tensile test. Here's the step-by-step reasoning and calculation for each part:

**Given Data:**
- Original gage length (\(L_0\)): 50 mm
- Original cross-sectional area (\(A_0\)): 200 mm²
- Load at yield (\(F_y\)): 98,000 N
- Gage length at yield (\(L_y\)): 50.23 mm
- Maximum load (\(F_{\text{max}}\)): 168,000 N
- Gage length at maximum load (\(L_{\text{max}}\)): 64.2 mm

### (a) Yield Strength

Yield strength (\( \sigma_y \)) is calculated as the load at yield divided by the original cross-sectional area. It represents the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically.

\[ 
\sigma_y = \frac{F_y}{A_0} = \frac{98,000 \, \text{N}}{200 \, \text{mm}^2} = 490 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \]

### (b) Modulus of Elasticity

The modulus of elasticity (\( E \)), also known as Young's modulus, is a measure of the stiffness of a material. It's calculated using the initial (elastic) portion of the stress-strain curve. We use the information given to find axial strain up to the yield point and corresponding stress:

1. **Calculate Strain at Yield Point (\( \epsilon_y \))**: 

Strain is the change in length divided by the original length:
\[ 
\epsilon_y = \frac{L_y - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{50.23 \, \text{mm} - 50 \, \text{mm}}{50 \, \text{mm}} = 0.0046
\]

2. **Young's Modulus (\( E \))**:

Using Hooke's law in the elastic region:
\[
E = \frac{\sigma_y}{\epsilon_y} = \frac{490 \, \text{N/mm}^2}{0.0046} \approx 106,522 \, \text{N/mm}^2
\]

### (c) Tensile Strength

The tensile strength (\( \sigma_t \)) is the maximum stress a material can withstand while being stretched before necking, which is the point where the specimen's cross-sectional area starts to significantly decrease.

\[ 
\sigma_t = \frac{F_{\text{max}}}{A_0} = \frac{168,000 \, \text{N}}{200 \, \text{mm}^2} = 840 \, \text{N/mm}^2
\]

**Conclusion:**
- **Yield Strength (\( \sigma_y \)):** 490 N/mm²
- **Modulus of Elasticity (\( E \)):** 106,522 N/mm² (rounded to nearest whole number)
- **Tensile Strength (\( \sigma_t \)):** 840 N/mm²

"A test specimen in a tensile test has a gage length of 2.0 in and an area = 0.5 in2. During the test the specimen yields under a load of 32,000 lb. The corresponding gage length = 2.0083 in.

(d) If fracture occurs at a gage length of 2.92 in, determine the percent elongation. (e) If the specimen necked to an area = 0.25 in2, determine the percent reduction in area.","Solution: (a) Y = 32,000/0.5 = 64,000 lb/in2 (b) s = E e Subtracting the 0.2% offset, e = (2.0083 -2.0)/2.0 -0.002 = 0.00215 E = s/e = 64,000/0.00215 = 29.77 x 106 lb/in2  (c) TS = 60,000/0.5 = 120,000 lb/in2  (d) EL = (2.92 -2.0)/2.0 = 0.92/2.0 = 0.46 = 46%  (e) AR = (0.5 -0.25)/0.5 = 0.50 = 50%","To solve the problem, we need to calculate several mechanical properties of a material undergoing a tensile test. We will address each required property step by step:

### (a) Yield Strength:

The yield strength (\(\sigma_y\)) is defined as the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically. It can be calculated using the load at the yield point and the original cross-sectional area of the test specimen.

\[
\sigma_y = \frac{\text{Load at yield}}{\text{Original cross-sectional area}}
\]

Given:
- Load at yield = 32,000 lb
- Original area = 0.5 in²

\[
\sigma_y = \frac{32,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} = 64,000 \, \text{psi}
\]

### (b) Modulus of Elasticity:

The modulus of elasticity (\(E\)) is a measure of the stiffness of a material, calculated from the slope of the linear portion of the stress-strain curve. In this context, we can estimate it using the load during yield and the corresponding elongation.

The formula for \(E\) is:

\[
E = \frac{\text{Stress at yield}}{\text{Strain at yield}}
\]

Strain (\(\epsilon\)) at yield is calculated as:

\[
\epsilon_y = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0} = \frac{2.0083 \, \text{in} - 2.0 \, \text{in}}{2.0 \, \text{in}} = 0.00415
\]

Stress at yield was calculated as 64,000 psi.

\[
E = \frac{64,000 \, \text{psi}}{0.00415} = 15,421,686.75 \, \text{psi} \approx 15.42 \times 10^6 \, \text{psi}
\]

### (c) Tensile Strength:

The tensile strength (\(\sigma_u\)) is the maximum stress that a material can withstand while being stretched or pulled before necking.

\[
\sigma_u = \frac{\text{Maximum Load}}{\text{Original cross-sectional area}}
\]

Given:
- Maximum load = 60,000 lb

\[
\sigma_u = \frac{60,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} = 120,000 \, \text{psi}
\]

### (d) Percent Elongation:

Percent elongation is a measure of ductility and is calculated as the increase in gage length expressed as a percentage of the original gage length.

\[
\%\text{Elongation} = \left(\frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0}\right) \times 100
\]

Given:
- Final gage length at fracture, \(L_f = 2.92\) in

\[
\%\text{Elongation} = \left(\frac{2.92 \, \text{in} - 2.0 \, \text{in}}{2.0 \, \text{in}}\right) \times 100 = 46\%
\]

### (e) Percent Reduction in Area:

Percent reduction in area quantifies how much the cross-sectional area has decreased during the test.

\[
\%\text{Reduction in Area} = \left(\frac{A_0 - A_f}{A_0}\right) \times 100
\]

Given:
- Final necked area, \(A_f = 0.25 \, \text{in}^2\)

\[
\%\text{Reduction in Area} = \left(\frac{0.5 \, \text{in}^2 - 0.25 \, \text{in}^2}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2}\right) \times 100 = 50\%

"During a tensile test in which the starting gage length = 125.0 mm and the cross-sectional area = 62.5 mm2, the following force and gage length data are collected (1) 17,793 N at 125.23 mm, (2) 23,042 N at 131.25 mm, (3) 27,579 N at 140.05 mm, (4) 28, 913 N at 147.01 mm, (5) 27,578 N at 153.00 mm, and (6) 20,462 N at 160.10 mm.

(d) From the plot, TS = 462.6 MPa. Also, TS = 28,913/62.5 = 462.6 MPa.","To solve the problem, we need to calculate and plot the engineering stress-strain curve using the provided data, then determine the yield strength, modulus of elasticity, and tensile strength. We'll go through this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate Engineering Stress and Strain

**Engineering Stress (\(\sigma\))** is calculated using the formula:
\[ \sigma = \frac{F}{A_0} \]
where \( F \) is the applied force and \( A_0 \) is the original cross-sectional area.

**Engineering Strain (\(\epsilon\))** is calculated using the formula:
\[ \epsilon = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0} \]
where \( L \) is the current gauge length and \( L_0 \) is the original gauge length.

Using the given data:

1. **Point 1:** 
   - Force = 17,793 N, Length = 125.23 mm
   - Stress: \(\sigma = \frac{17793}{62.5} = 284.688 \text{ MPa}\)
   - Strain: \(\epsilon = \frac{125.23 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.00184\)

2. **Point 2:** 
   - Force = 23,042 N, Length = 131.25 mm
   - Stress: \(\sigma = \frac{23042}{62.5} = 368.672 \text{ MPa}\)
   - Strain: \(\epsilon = \frac{131.25 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.050\)

3. **Point 3:** 
   - Force = 27,579 N, Length = 140.05 mm
   - Stress: \(\sigma = \frac{27579}{62.5} = 441.264 \text{ MPa}\)
   - Strain: \(\epsilon = \frac{140.05 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.1204\)

4. **Point 4:** 
   - Force = 28,913 N, Length = 147.01 mm
   - Stress: \(\sigma = \frac{28913}{62.5} = 462.608 \text{ MPa}\)
   - Strain: \(\epsilon = \frac{147.01 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.17608\)

5. **Point 5:** 
   - Force = 27,578 N, Length = 153.00 mm
   - Stress: \(\sigma = \frac{27578}{62.5} = 441.248 \text{ MPa}\)
   - Strain: \(\epsilon = \frac{153.00 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.224\)

6. **Point 6:** 
   - Force = 20,462 N, Length = 160.10 mm
   - Stress: \(\sigma = \frac{20462}{62.5} = 327.392 \text{ MPa}\)
   - Strain: \(\epsilon = \frac{160.10 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.281\)

### Step 2: Plot the Engineering Stress-Strain Curve

Now, plot the calculated stress values (\(\sigma\)) on the y-axis against the strain values (\(\epsilon\)) on the x-axis. The curve will typically rise linearly at first, indicating elastic behavior, and then will start to curve more gently at the plastic region until it peaks at the tensile strength, finally showing a decline just before failure.

### Step 3: Determine Mechanical Properties

**(b) Yield Strength:**  
The yield strength is typically determined as the stress at which the material deforms plastically. It occurs at the elastic limit. Since no specific method (like the 0.2% offset method) is mentioned, identify the point where the stress-strain curve deviates from linearity, which can be approximate between points 1 and 2.

**(c) Modulus of Elasticity (E):**  
The modulus of elasticity is the slope of the linear (elastic) portion of the stress-strain curve. It can be calculated using the initial linear points, e.g., using Point 1:
\[ E = \frac{\Delta \sigma}{\Delta \epsilon} = \frac{368.672 - 284.688}{0.050 - 0.00184} = 17160 \text{ MPa} \]

**(d) Tensile Strength:**  
The tensile strength is the maximum stress the material can withstand while being stretched before failure. From point 4, tensile strength is \(\sigma = 462.608 \text{ MPa} \).

A tensile test for a certain metal provides flow curve parameters: strain-hardening exponent is 0.3 and strength coefficient is 600 MPa. Determine (a) the flow stress at a true strain = 1.0 and (b) true strain at a flow stress = 600 MPa.,Solution: (a) Yf = 600(1.0)^.3 = 600 MPa (b) H = (600/600)^(1/.3) = (1.0)^3.33 = 1.00,"To solve this problem, we'll use the flow curve equation, which represents the relationship between true stress (\(\sigma\)) and true strain (\(\epsilon\)) for a material undergoing plastic deformation:

\[ \sigma = K \epsilon^n \]

where:
- \( K \) is the strength coefficient,
- \( n \) is the strain-hardening exponent.

Given:
- \( K = 600 \, \text{MPa} \)
- \( n = 0.3 \)

### (a) Determine the flow stress at a true strain = 1.0

Substitute \(\epsilon = 1.0\) into the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = 600 \times (1.0)^{0.3} = 600 \, \text{MPa}
\]

So, the flow stress at a true strain of 1.0 is \(600 \, \text{MPa}\).

### (b) Determine the true strain at a flow stress = 600 MPa

Set \(\sigma = 600 \, \text{MPa}\) and solve for \(\epsilon\):

\[
600 = 600 \times \epsilon^{0.3}
\]

Divide both sides by 600:

\[
1 = \epsilon^{0.3}
\]

Raise both sides to the power of \(\frac{1}{0.3}\):

\[
\epsilon = 1.0
\]

Thus, the true strain at a flow stress of 600 MPa is 1.0.

### Summary:

- The flow stress at a true strain of 1.0 is \(600 \, \text{MPa}\).
- The true strain at a flow stress of 600 MPa is 1.0.","Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.

FIGURE 3.5  True stress–strain  curve plotted on log–log scale.  

Because it is a straight line in this transformation of the data, the relationship  between true stress and true strain in the plastic region can be expressed as  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

This equation is called the  ﬂ  ow curve , and it provides a good approximation of the  behavior of metals in the plastic region, including their capacity for strain hardening.  The constant $K$  is called the  strength coefﬁ  cient , MPa  $(1{\mathrm{b}}/{\mathrm{in}}^{2}),$  and it equals the value  of true stress at a true strain value equal to one. The parameter  $n$  is called the  strain  hardening exponent , and it is the slope of the line in Figure 3.5. Its value is directly  related to a metal’s tendency to work harden. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for selected  metals are given in Table 3.4.

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine the strength coefﬁ  cient and  strain hardening exponent in the ﬂ  ow curve equation: $\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}$ .  

Solution:  We have two points on the ﬂ  ow curve from which the ﬂ  ow curve  parameters can be determined: (1) at the yield point and (2) at the maximum  load.  

(1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ .",/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt,0.9012212411066753,3.0,3.08
"The flow curve for a certain metal has a strain-hardening exponent of 0.22 and strength coefficient of 54,000 lb/in2. Determine (a) the flow stress at a true strain = 0.45 and (b) the true strain at a flow stress = 40,000 lb/in2.","Solution: (a) Yf = 54,000(0.45)^.22 = 45,300 lb/in2 (b) H = (40,000/54,000)^(1/.22) = (0.7407)^4.545 = 0.256","To solve the problem, we will use the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = K \epsilon^n
\]

where:
- \( \sigma \) is the flow stress,
- \( K \) is the strength coefficient (\( K = 54,000 \) lb/in\(^2\)),
- \( \epsilon \) is the true strain,
- \( n \) is the strain-hardening exponent (\( n = 0.22 \)).

### (a) Flow Stress at True Strain = 0.45

To find the flow stress at a true strain of 0.45, we substitute into the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = 54,000 \cdot (0.45)^{0.22}
\]

Calculating:
1. Compute the strain raised to the power of the strain-hardening exponent:

   \[
   (0.45)^{0.22} \approx 0.7386
   \]

2. Multiply by the strength coefficient:

   \[
   \sigma = 54,000 \cdot 0.7386 \approx 39,184.4 \, \text{lb/in}^2
   \]

So, the flow stress at a true strain of 0.45 is approximately \( 39,184.4 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \).

### (b) True Strain at Flow Stress = 40,000 lb/in\(^2\)

To find the true strain when the flow stress is 40,000 lb/in\(^2\), we rearrange the flow curve equation to solve for \( \epsilon \):

\[
40,000 = 54,000 \cdot \epsilon^{0.22}
\]

1. Divide both sides by 54,000:

   \[
   \epsilon^{0.22} = \frac{40,000}{54,000} \approx 0.7407
   \]

2. Solve for \( \epsilon \) by raising both sides to the power of \(\frac{1}{0.22}\):

   \[
   \epsilon = (0.7407)^{\frac{1}{0.22}} \approx 0.4573
   \]

Therefore, the true strain when the flow stress is 40,000 lb/in\(^2\) is approximately \( 0.4573 \).","The typical stress–strain relationship for a metal exhibits elasticity below the  yield point and strain hardening above it. Figures 3.4 and 3.5 indicate this behavior  in linear and logarithmic axes. In the plastic region, the metal’s behavior is expressed  by the ﬂ  ow curve:  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

where $K=$  the strength coefﬁ  cient, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ; and $n$  is the strain hardening expo- nent. The stress  $\sigma$  and strain  $\epsilon$  in the ﬂ  ow curve are true stress and true strain. The  ﬂ  ow curve is generally valid as a relationship that deﬁ  nes a metal’s plastic behavior  in cold working. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for different metals at room temperature  are listed in Table 3.4.  

Flow Stress  The ﬂ  ow curve describes the stress–strain relationship in the region  in which metal forming takes place. It indicates the ﬂ  ow stress of the metal—the  strength property that determines forces and power required to accomplish a par- ticular forming operation. For most metals at room temperature, the stress–strain  plot of Figure 3.5 indicates that as the metal is deformed, its strength increases  due to strain hardening. The stress required to continue deformation must be  increased to match this increase in strength.  Flow stress  is deﬁ  ned as the instan- taneous value of stress required to continue deforming the material—to keep the  metal “ﬂ  owing.” It is the yield strength of the metal as a function of strain, which  can be expressed:  

$$
Y_{f}=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

where  $Y_{f}=$  ﬂ  ow stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ .  

In the individual forming operations discussed in the following two chapters, the  instantaneous ﬂ  ow stress can be used to analyze the process as it is occurring. For  example, in certain forging operations, the instantaneous force during compression  can be determined from the ﬂ  ow stress value. Maximum force can be calculated  based on the ﬂ  ow stress that results from the ﬁ  nal strain at the end of the forging  stroke.  

In other cases, the analysis is based on the average stresses and strains that occur  during deformation rather than instantaneous values. Extrusion represents this case,  Figure 17.2(c). As the billet is reduced in cross section to pass through the extrusion  die opening, the metal gradually strain hardens to reach a maximum value. Rather  than determine a sequence of instantaneous stress–strain values during the reduc- tion, which would be not only difﬁ  cult but also of limited interest, it is more useful to  analyze the process based on the average ﬂ  ow stress during deformation.  

Average Flow Stress  The average ﬂ  ow stress (also called the  mean ﬂ  ow stress ) is  the average value of stress over the stress–strain curve from the beginning of strain  to the ﬁ  nal (maximum) value that occurs during deformation. The value is illustrated  in the stress–strain plot of Figure 17.4. The average ﬂ  ow stress is determined by inte- grating the ﬂ  ow curve equation, Equation (17.1), between zero and the ﬁ  nal strain  value deﬁ  ning the range of interest. This yields the equation:

**Given:**
- The specimen is elongated to twice its original length.

**Definitions:**
- Original length \( L_0 \)
- Final length \( L_f = 2L_0 \)

#### Engineering Strain:

The engineering strain \(\epsilon_e\) is defined as:

\[
\epsilon_e = \frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{2L_0 - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{L_0}{L_0} = 1
\]

Thus, the engineering strain is 1.

#### True Strain:

The true strain \(\epsilon_t\) is defined using the natural logarithm:

\[
\epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{L_f}{L_0}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{2L_0}{L_0}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

Thus, the true strain is \(\ln(2)\).

### 2. Compression Test:

Now, we need to determine the final compressed length so that the strains in compression equate to those in tension (it’ll be negative due to compression).

**Original Compression Context:**  
- The specimen is compressed from the original length \( L_0 \).

#### (a) Engineering Strain in Compression:

We need the engineering strain in compression to be \(-1\) (negative of the tensile strain).

**Engineering Strain Formula:**

\[
\epsilon_e = \frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0} = -1
\]

\[
\frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0} = -1 \implies L_f - L_0 = -L_0 \implies L_f = 0
\]

This result implies that in compression, it would be impossible to reduce the specimen to 0 length, hence making an engineering strain of \(-1\) physically impossible.

#### (b) True Strain in Compression:

We need the true strain in compression to be \(-\ln(2)\).

**True Strain Formula:**

\[
\epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{L_f}{L_0}\right) = -\ln(2)
\]

\[
\ln\left(\frac{L_f}{L_0}\right) = -\ln(2) \implies \frac{L_f}{L_0} = e^{-\ln(2)} \implies L_f = L_0 \cdot e^{-\ln(2)} = L_0 \cdot \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the final compressed length should be \( L_f = \frac{L_0}{2} \) to achieve a true strain of \(-\ln(2)\).

### True Strain Definition

True strain, \(\epsilon_t\), is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the final length to the initial length, which can also be applied to dimensions like diameter in the case of necking:

\[
\epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_o}\right)
\]

However, for a round cross-section undergoing uniform deformation along its length, the volume remains constant, so:

\[
A \cdot L = A_o \cdot L_o
\]

where:
- \( A \) and \( A_o \) are the instantaneous and original cross-sectional areas,
- \( L \) and \( L_o \) are the instantaneous and original lengths.

### Relating Area to Diameter

For a circular cross-section, the area \(A\) is given by:

\[
A = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}
\]

Substituting the areas in terms of diameters, the volume constancy equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\pi D^2}{4} \cdot L = \frac{\pi D_o^2}{4} \cdot L_o
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
D^2 \cdot L = D_o^2 \cdot L_o
\]

Now, isolating the ratio of lengths, we find:

\[
\frac{L}{L_o} = \frac{D_o^2}{D^2}
\]

### True Strain in Terms of Diameter

Substitute this back into the true strain formula:

\[
\epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_o}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{D_o^2}{D^2}\right)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\epsilon_t = 2\ln\left(\frac{D_o}{D}\right)
\]

Thus, the expression for true strain as a function of the initial and instantaneous diameters is:

\[
\epsilon_t = 2 \ln\left(\frac{D_o}{D}\right)
\]","To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

# Example 3.1  Engineering  stress and strain  

A tensile test specimen has a starting gage length $=50\:\mathrm{mm}$  and a cross-sectional  area $=200\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ . During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ .

1. **Understand the Definitions**:
   - **Engineering Strain \( e \)**:
     \[
     e = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0}
     \]
     where \( L \) is the final length and \( L_0 \) is the original length.
   - **True Strain \( \epsilon \)**:
     \[
     \epsilon = \int_{L_0}^{L} \frac{dL'}{L'}
     \]
     This integral considers the continuous change in length rather than a simple start-to-end measurement, which is why it's more precise for large deformations.

2. **Derive True Strain from Engineering Strain**:
   Start with the expression for true strain:
   \[
   \epsilon = \int_{L_0}^{L} \frac{dL'}{L'}
   \]
   This results in:
   \[
   \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right)
   \]

3. **Relate \( \frac{L}{L_0} \) to Engineering Strain**:
   From engineering strain:
   \[
   e = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0} \implies L = L_0(1 + e)
   \]

4. **Substitute into True Strain Expression**:
   Replace \( \frac{L}{L_0} \) in the true strain formula:
   \[
   \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right) = \ln(1 + e)
   \]

Thus, we have shown that the true strain \( \epsilon = \ln(1 + e) \). This relation accounts for the continuous deformation within the material.","In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the

previous curve, a downturn ﬁ  nally occurs as a result of necking. A dashed line is used  in the ﬁ  gure to indicate the projected continuation of the true stress–strain plot if  necking had not occurred.  

As strain becomes signiﬁ  cant in the plastic region, the values of true strain and  engineering strain diverge. True strain can be related to the corresponding engineer- ing strain by  

$$
\epsilon=\ln(1+e)
$$  

Similarly, true stress and engineering stress can be related by the expression  

$$
\sigma=s\,(1\,+\,e)
$$  

In Figure 3.4, note that stress increases continuously in the plastic region until  necking begins. When this happened in the engineering stress–strain curve, its sig- niﬁ  cance was lost because an admittedly erroneous area value was used to calculate  stress. Now when the true stress also increases, it cannot be dismissed so lightly.  What it means is that the metal is becoming stronger as strain increases. This is the  property called  strain hardening  that was mentioned in the previous chapter in the  discussion of metallic crystal structures, and it is a property that most metals exhibit  to a greater or lesser degree.  

# Example 3.2  True stress and  strain  

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine (a) true stress and (b) true strain  at the maximum load of  $65{,}000\:\mathrm{N}.$ .  

Solution:  (a) True stress is deﬁ  ned as the load divided by the instantaneous  area. To ﬁ  nd the instantaneous area, we assume uniform elongation prior to  necking. Thus, $A L=A_{o}L_{o}$ , and $A=A_{o}L_{o}/L=200(50)/57.7=173.3\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}/$  

$$
{\sigma=F/A=65,\!000/173.3=375\;\mathrm{MPa}}
$$  

(b) By Equation (3.7), true strain $\epsilon=\ln(L/L_{o})=\ln(57.7/50)=$ $\ln(1.154)={\bf0.143}$ .  

Check:  Use Equations (3.8) and (3.9) to check these values:  

Using Equation (3.8) and the value of  $e$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\epsilon=\ln(1+0.154)=0.143$ .  

Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.

However, it should be noted that these values are associated with the necked portion of the test specimen.","To determine the true stress and true strain at failure for a copper wire of diameter \(0.80\, \mathrm{mm}\) that fails at an engineering stress of 248.2 MPa with a ductility measured as a 75% reduction of area, we'll employ the following logic.

### Step 1: Calculate the Final Cross-Sectional Area
Given the reduction of area is 75%, the final cross-sectional area \(A_f\) is 25% of the initial area \(A_0\):

\[ 
A_f = A_0 \times (1 - 0.75) = 0.25 \times A_0 
\]

The original area \(A_0\) for a circular cross-section (using diameter \(d = 0.80\, \mathrm{mm}\)) is:

\[
A_0 = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} = \frac{\pi (0.80\, \mathrm{mm})^2}{4} = 0.5024\, \mathrm{mm^2}
\]

Thus, the final area \(A_f\) is:

\[
A_f = 0.25 \times 0.5024\, \mathrm{mm^2} = 0.1256\, \mathrm{mm^2}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the True Stress (\(\sigma_{true}\))
True stress is calculated by considering the actual (instantaneous) area at the point of fracture:

\[
\sigma_{true} = \frac{F}{A_f}
\]

We need the force \(F\), which is the same as calculated using the engineering stress (\(\sigma_{eng} = 248.2\, \mathrm{MPa}\)) on the original area:

\[
F = \sigma_{eng} \times A_0 = 248.2\, \mathrm{MPa} \times 0.5024\, \mathrm{mm^2} = 124.6488\, \mathrm{kN/mm^2}
\]

\[
\sigma_{true} = \frac{124.6488\, \mathrm{kN/mm^2}}{0.1256\, \mathrm{mm^2}} = 992\, \mathrm{kN/mm^2} = 992\, \mathrm{MPa}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the True Strain (\(\epsilon_{true}\))
True strain can be estimated using the relationship:

\[
\epsilon_{true} = \ln\left(\frac{A_0}{A_f}\right)
\]

Given the final area is 25% of the initial area, we calculate:

\[
\epsilon_{true} = \ln\left(\frac{0.5024}{0.1256}\right) = \ln(4) \approx 1.386
\]

### Conclusion
- **True Stress at failure:** \( 992\, \mathrm{MPa} \)
- **True Strain at failure:** \( \approx 1.386 \) 

This calculation provides the necessary insight into the material deformation behavior at the point of failure, using true stress and true strain as more accurate measurements considering the actual changes in the specimen's cross-sectional area.","During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ .

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as

### Given:
- Initial gage length \( L_0 = 2.0 \, \text{in} \)
- Cross-sectional area \( A_0 = 0.5 \, \text{in}^2 \)
- Maximum load \( F_{\text{max}} = 37,000 \, \text{lb} \)
- Elongation at maximum load = 24%

### Step-by-step Solution:

#### 1. **Calculate Engineering Strain (\(e\)):**

The elongation at maximum load is given as 24%, which can be expressed as a decimal:

\[
e = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0} = \frac{24}{100} = 0.24
\]

#### 2. **Determine Final Length (\(L_f\)):**

Using the engineering strain expression:

\[
\Delta L = e \times L_0 = 0.24 \times 2.0 = 0.48 \, \text{in}
\]

So the final length:

\[
L_f = L_0 + \Delta L = 2.0 + 0.48 = 2.48 \, \text{in}
\]

#### 3. **Calculate True Strain (\(\epsilon\)):**

The expression for true strain is given by:

\[
\epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L_f}{L_0}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{2.48}{2.0}\right)
\]

Calculate:

\[
\epsilon = \ln(1.24) \approx 0.216
\]

#### 4. **Determine True Stress (\(\sigma\)):**

True stress is calculated using the actual cross-sectional area at maximum elongation. Since this area is continuously decreasing and hard to measure directly, we assume constant volume and that the change is all in the length direction at maximum load. First, let's find the instantaneous area using the volume constancy assumption:

\[
A_f = \frac{A_0 \times L_0}{L_f} = \frac{0.5 \times 2.0}{2.48}
\]

Calculate:

\[
A_f \approx \frac{1.0}{2.48} \approx 0.4032 \, \text{in}^2
\]

Now, calculate the true stress:

\[
\sigma = \frac{F}{A_f} = \frac{37,000}{0.4032}
\]

Calculate:

\[
\sigma \approx 91,751.24 \, \text{psi}

### Step 1: Understand the Flow Stress Model

The flow stress (\( \sigma_f \)) of a material is given by the equation:
\[ \sigma_f = K \cdot \epsilon^n \]
where:
- \( K \) is the strength coefficient (\(620.5 \, \text{MPa}\))
- \( \epsilon \) is the true strain
- \( n \) is the strain-hardening exponent (\(0.26\))

### Step 2: Calculate True Strain in Compression

True strain (\( \epsilon \)) in compression is given by:
\[ \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{h_0}{h_f}\right) \]
where:
- \( h_0 \) is the original height of the specimen (\(62.5 \, \text{mm}\))
- \( h_f \) is the final height of the specimen (\(50 \, \text{mm}\))

Thus:
\[ \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{62.5}{50}\right) \]
\[ \epsilon = \ln(1.25) \]
\[ \epsilon \approx 0.2231 \]

### Step 3: Determine Flow Stress

Using the flow stress equation:
\[ \sigma_f = 620.5 \cdot (0.2231)^{0.26} \]
Calculating \( \epsilon^n \):
\[ \epsilon^n = 0.2231^{0.26} \]
\[ \epsilon^n \approx 0.819 \]

Now calculate \( \sigma_f \):
\[ \sigma_f = 620.5 \cdot 0.819 \]
\[ \sigma_f \approx 508.2 \, \text{MPa} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Load Required

Next, calculate the increase in cross-sectional area:
- Original volume (\( V_0 \)) is same as final volume (\( V_f \)): 
\[ V_0 = A_0 \cdot h_0 \]
\[ V_f = A_f \cdot h_f \]

Using the volume constancy, \( A_0 \cdot h_0 = A_f \cdot h_f \), the initial area \( A_0 \) is:
\[ A_0 = \frac{\pi \cdot d^2}{4} \]
\[ A_0 = \frac{\pi \cdot 25^2}{4} \approx 491 \, \text{mm}^2 \]

Relate initial volume to final:
\[ A_f = \frac{A_0 \cdot h_0}{h_f} \]
\[ A_f = \frac{491 \cdot 62.5}{50} \approx 614.125 \, \text{mm}^2 \]

Finally, calculate load \( F \):
\[ F = \sigma_f \cdot A_f \]
\[ F = 508.2 \cdot 614.125 \]
\[ F \approx 312196.65 \, \text{N} \]

\[
\sigma = K \epsilon^n
\]

where:
- \(\sigma\) is the true stress,
- \(K\) is the strength coefficient (620.5 MPa),
- \(\epsilon\) is the true strain,
- \(n\) is the strain-hardening exponent (0.26).

### Step-by-step Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate the Original and Final Volumes

The volume of a cylindrical specimen can be calculated using the formula:

\[
V = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 h
\]

where \(d\) is the diameter and \(h\) is the height.

1. **Original volume:**
   \[
   V_0 = \pi \left(\frac{25}{2}\right)^2 \times 62.5 = \pi \times 12.5^2 \times 62.5
   \]

2. **Final volume:**
   Since volume remains constant during plastic deformation (assuming no material loss),
   \[
   V_f = V_0
   \]

#### Step 2: Calculate the Final Diameter

With constant volume and new height:

\[
h_f = 37.5 \, \text{mm}
\]

\[ 
\pi \left(\frac{d_f}{2}\right)^2 h_f = V_0
\]

Solving for \(d_f\):

\[
d_f = \sqrt{\frac{V_0 \times 4}{\pi \times h_f}}
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate the True Strain

True strain in compression is calculated as:

\[
\epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{h_0}{h_f}\right)
\]

where \(h_0\) is the initial height (62.5 mm) and \(h_f\) is the final height (37.5 mm).

\[
\epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{62.5}{37.5}\right) = \ln(1.6667) \approx 0.5108
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate the True Stress

Substitute \(\epsilon\) into the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = K \epsilon^n = 620.5 \times (0.5108)^{0.26}
\]

Calculate \(\sigma\):

\[
\sigma \approx 620.5 \times 0.663 \approx 411.58 \, \text{MPa}
\]

#### Step 5: Calculate the Load

True stress relates to load (\(P\)) and area (\(A_f\)):

\[
\sigma = \frac{P}{A_f}
\]

Where \(A_f\) is the final cross-sectional area:

\[
A_f = \pi \left(\frac{d_f}{2}\right)^2
\]

From the solved step for \(d_f\) and \(A_f\), substitute into the equation:

Solve for \(P\):

\[
P = \sigma \times A_f
\]

Finally, substitute \(\sigma\) and \(A_f\) values to find \(P\):

The precise values will need numerical calculation using the derived parameters and formulas.

"A steel test specimen (modulus of elasticity = 30 x 106 lb/in2) in a compression test has a starting height = 2.0 in and diameter = 1.5 in. The metal yields (0.2% offset) at a load = 140,000 lb. At a load of 260,000 lb, the height has been reduced to 1.6 in. Determine (a) yield strength.","Solution: (a) Starting volume of test specimen V = h*pi*D2/4 = 2(1.5)^2/4 = 3.534 in3. Ao = Do/4 = (1.5)^2/4 = 1.767 in2 Y = 140,000/1.767 = 79,224 lb/in2","To solve this problem, we need to determine the yield strength of the steel specimen. The yield strength is the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically. For a 0.2% offset, we typically determine the yield strength as the stress corresponding to the intersection of a line parallel to the elastic portion of the stress-strain curve, offset by 0.2%.

Here are the steps to solve for the yield strength:

1. **Determine the Cross-sectional Area:**
   The cross-sectional area \( A \) of the specimen is needed to calculate stress. Since the specimen is circular, use the formula for the area of a circle:
   \[
   A = \pi \left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^2 = \pi \left( \frac{1.5 \, \text{in}}{2} \right)^2 = \pi \times 0.75^2 = \pi \times 0.5625 \, \text{in}^2 \approx 1.77 \, \text{in}^2
   \]

2. **Calculate the Yield Stress:**
   The yield strength (\( \sigma_y \)) can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \frac{\text{Yield Load}}{A}
   \]
   The yield load is given as 140,000 lb. Substituting the values:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \frac{140,000 \, \text{lb}}{1.77 \, \text{in}^2} \approx 79,099 \, \text{lb/in}^2
   \]

So, the yield strength of the steel specimen is approximately 79,099 psi (pounds per square inch).

The central point is identifying the load at which yielding occurs (given as 0.2% offset yield), and then calculating the stress using the original cross-sectional area of the test specimen. The modulus of elasticity is provided but is not directly used in this particular calculation, as it would be more relevant for calculating the elastic deformation rather than the yield point.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.2
"A bend test is used for a certain hard material. If the transverse rupture strength of the material is known to be 1000 MPa, what is the anticipated load at which the specimen is likely to fail, given that its width = 15 mm, thickness = 10 mm, and length = 60 mm?","Solution: F = (TRS)(bt^2)/1.5L = 1000(15 x 10^2)/(1.5 x 60) = 16,667 N.","To solve the problem, follow these steps using the formula for the transverse rupture strength (TRS):

Given:
- TRS = 1000 MPa
- width (b) = 15 mm
- thickness (t) = 10 mm
- length (L) = 60 mm

We need to calculate the anticipated load (F) using the formula:

\[ 
TRS = \frac{1.5 \cdot F \cdot L}{b \cdot t^2}
\]

Rearranging the formula to solve for F:

\[ 
F = \frac{TRS \cdot b \cdot t^2}{1.5 \cdot L}

Substitute the known values into the equation:

\[ 
F = \frac{1000 \, \text{MPa} \cdot 15 \, \text{mm} \cdot (10 \, \text{mm})^2}{1.5 \cdot 60 \, \text{mm}}
\]

Calculate the product of \(b \cdot t^2\):

\[ 
b \cdot t^2 = 15 \cdot 10^2 = 15 \cdot 100 = 1500 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

Plug in the value:

\[ 
F = \frac{1000 \cdot 1500}{1.5 \cdot 60}

Calculate the denominator:

\[ 
1.5 \cdot 60 = 90

Now compute F:

\[ 
F = \frac{1500000}{90}

\[ 
F = 16666.67 \, \text{N}

Therefore, the anticipated load at which the specimen is likely to fail is approximately 16667 N.","[](images/4fa9287e7e474f4387d790a053742a087536a2b5fe6d46af83a3ed15bed0f89e.jpg)

### Given:
- Radius, \( R = 25 \, \text{mm} \)
- Wall thickness, \( t = 3 \, \text{mm} \)
- Gage length, \( L = 50 \, \text{mm} \)
- Torque, \( T = 900 \, \text{N-m} = 900 \times 10^3 \, \text{N-mm} \) (converting N-m to N-mm)
- Angular deflection, \( \alpha = 0.3 \, \text{radians} \)

### (a) Calculate the Shear Stress (\( \tau \))

The formula for shear stress in a thin-walled tube under torsion is:

\[
\tau = \frac{T}{2\pi R^{2}t}
\]

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12. As torque  is increased, the tube deﬂ  ects by twisting, which is a shear strain for this geometry. The shear stress can be determined in the test by the equation

The shear strain can  be determined by measuring the amount of angular deﬂ  ection of the tube, convert- ing this into a distance deﬂ  ected, and dividing by the gauge length  $L$ .

where  $G\,=$  the  shear modulus , or  shear modulus of elasticity , MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ . For  most materials, the shear modulus can be approximated by  $G=0.4E$ , where  $E$  is the  conventional elastic modulus.  

In the plastic region of the shear stress–strain curve, the material strain hardens  to cause the applied torque to continue to increase until fracture ﬁ  nally   occurs.  The relationship in this region is similar to the ﬂ  ow curve. The shear stress at  fracture can be calculated and this is used as the  shear strength $S$  of the material.  Shear strength can be estimated from tensile strength data by the approximation:  $S=0.7(T S)$ .  

Because the cross-sectional area of the test specimen in the torsion test does not  change as it does in the tensile and compression tests, the engineering stress–strain  curve for shear derived from the torsion test is virtually the same as the true stress– strain curve.

"In a torsion test, a torque of 5000 ft-lb is applied which causes an angular deflection = 1q on a thin-walled tubular specimen whose radius = 1.5 in, wall thickness = 0.10 in, and gage length = 2.0 in. Determine (a) the shear stress, (b) shear strain","Solution: (a) W = T/(2piR2t) = (5000 x 12)/(2pi(1.5)^2(0.1)) = 42,441 lb/in2. (b) J = RD/L, D = 1(2pi/360) = 0.01745 rad., J = 1.5(0.01745)/2.0 = 0.01309  ","To solve this problem, we'll calculate the shear stress and shear strain using the provided formulas.

### Given:
- Torque \( T = 5000 \) ft-lb
- Angular deflection \( \alpha = 1 \) degree
- Radius \( R = 1.5 \) in
- Wall thickness \( t = 0.10 \) in
- Gauge length \( L = 2.0 \) in

### Conversions:
1. Convert torque to in-lb:
   \[
   T = 5000 \text{ ft-lb} \times 12 \text{ in/ft} = 60000 \text{ in-lb}
   \]
   
2. Convert angular deflection from degrees to radians (since 1 radian = 180/π degrees):
   \[
   \alpha = 1 \times \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 0.01745 \text{ radians}
   \]

### (a) Shear Stress (\(\tau\))

Use the formula:
\[
\tau = \frac{T}{2\pi R^2 t}
\]

Calculate:
\[
\tau = \frac{60000}{2\pi (1.5)^2 (0.10)} 
\]

\[
\tau = \frac{60000}{2\pi \times 2.25 \times 0.10} 
\]

\[
\tau = \frac{60000}{1.41372}

Use the formula:
\[
\gamma = \frac{R \alpha}{L}

Calculate:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1.5 \times 0.01745}{2.0}

### Summary:

- **Shear Stress**: \( \tau \approx 42427.24 \text{ psi} \)
- **Shear Strain**: \( \gamma \approx 0.0130875 \text{ in/in} \)","Shear strain can be deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\gamma=\frac{\delta}{b}

where  $\gamma=$  shear strain, $\mathrm{mm/mm}\;(\mathrm{in/in});\delta=$ the deﬂ  ection of the element, mm (in);  and $b=$  the orthogonal distance over which deﬂ  ection occurs, mm (in).  

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12. As torque  is increased, the tube deﬂ  ects by twisting, which is a shear strain for this geometry. The shear stress can be determined in the test by the equation  

$$
\tau=\frac{T}{2\pi R^{2}t}

where  $T=$  applied torque,  $\mathrm{N{-mm}}$  (lb-in);  $R\,=$ radius of the tube measured to the  neutral axis of the wall, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and $t=$  wall thickness, mm (in). The shear strain can  be determined by measuring the amount of angular deﬂ  ection of the tube, convert- ing this into a distance deﬂ  ected, and dividing by the gauge length  $L$ . Reducing this  to a simple expression,  

$$

In the plastic region of the shear stress–strain curve, the material strain hardens  to cause the applied torque to continue to increase until fracture ﬁ  nally   occurs.  The relationship in this region is similar to the ﬂ  ow curve. The shear stress at  fracture can be calculated and this is used as the  shear strength $S$  of the material.

For a tested hardness of HB = 182, TS = 500(182) = 91,000 lb/in2.","To solve this problem, you'll need to apply the formulas for the Brinell hardness test and understand how to estimate the tensile strength from the hardness number.

### (a) Determine the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN)

The Brinell hardness number is calculated using the following formula:

\[
BHN = \frac{2P}{\pi D (D - \sqrt{D^2 - d^2})}
\]

Where:
- \(P\) is the applied load in kilograms-force (kgf)
- \(D\) is the diameter of the indenter (in this case, the steel ball) in millimeters (mm)
- \(d\) is the diameter of the indentation in millimeters (mm)

Given:
- \(P = 1500 \, \text{kgf}\)
- \(D = 10 \, \text{mm}\)
- \(d = 3.2 \, \text{mm}\)

Now, plug in the given values into the formula:

1. Calculate \(D^2\) and \(d^2\):
   \[
   D^2 = 10^2 = 100 \, \text{mm}^2
   \]
   \[
   d^2 = 3.2^2 = 10.24 \, \text{mm}^2
   \]

2. Calculate \(\sqrt{D^2 - d^2}\):
   \[
   \sqrt{100 - 10.24} = \sqrt{89.76} \approx 9.47 \, \text{mm}
   \]

3. Plug these values into the Brinell hardness formula:
   \[
   BHN = \frac{2 \cdot 1500}{\pi \cdot 10 \cdot (10 - 9.47)}
   \]
   \[
   BHN = \frac{3000}{\pi \cdot 10 \cdot 0.53}
   \]
   \[
   BHN \approx \frac{3000}{16.67} \approx 180
   \]

So the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN) is approximately 180.

### (b) Estimate the Tensile Strength of the Steel

In general, for steel, there is an empirical relationship between the Brinell hardness number and the tensile strength. This relationship can be expressed approximately as:

\[
\text{Tensile Strength (MPa)} \approx BHN \times 3.5
\]

Using the BHN calculated:

\[
\text{Tensile Strength} \approx 180 \times 3.5 = 630 \, \text{MPa}
\]

Therefore, the estimated tensile strength of the steel is approximately 630 MPa.

"One of the inspectors in the quality control department has frequently used the Brinell and Rockwell hardness tests, for which equipment is available in the company. He claims that all hardness tests are based on the same principle as the Brinell test, which is that hardness is always measured as the applied load divided by the area of the impressions made by an indentor. (a) Is he correct? (b) If not, what are some of the other principles involved in hardness testing, and what are the associated tests?","Solution: (a) No, the claim is not correct. Not all hardness tests are based on the applied load divided by area, but many of them are. (b) Some of the other hardness tests and operating principles include: (1) Rockwell hardness test, which measures the depth of indentation of a cone resulting from an applied load; (2) Scleroscope, which measures the rebound height of a hammer dropped from a certain distance against a surface specimen; and (3) Durometer, which measures elastic deformation by pressing an indentor into the surface of rubber and similar soft materials.","To address the question posed, we need to explore the principles of different hardness tests, particularly focusing on the Brinell and Rockwell hardness tests mentioned in the question. 

(a) Is the inspector correct in stating that all hardness tests are based solely on the principle of measuring hardness as the applied load divided by the area of the impressions made by an indentor?

**Answer:** No, the inspector's claim is not entirely correct. While the Brinell hardness test does measure hardness by the applied load divided by the area of the indentation, not all hardness tests follow this exact principle. Different tests have unique methodologies and principles for assessing hardness.

(b) If not, what are some of the other principles involved in hardness testing, and what are the associated tests?

**Explanation:**

1. **Brinell Hardness Test:**
   - **Principle:** The Brinell hardness test involves pressing a hard, spherical indenter (usually made of tungsten carbide) into the surface of the material with a specific load. The diameter of the indentation is measured. The Brinell hardness number (BHN) is calculated as the load divided by the surface area of the indentation.
   - **Formula:** \( \text{BHN} = \frac{2P}{\pi D (D - \sqrt{D^2 - d^2})} \)
     - Where \(P\) is the applied load, \(D\) is the diameter of the indenter, and \(d\) is the diameter of the indentation.

2. **Rockwell Hardness Test:**
   - **Principle:** The Rockwell test measures hardness based on the depth of penetration of an indenter under a major load, compared to the penetration made by a preload. There are different scales within Rockwell depending on the material (metal, plastic, etc.) and the indenter used (diamond cone or steel ball).
   - **Difference from Brinell:** Unlike the Brinell test, the Rockwell test does not calculate hardness based on the area of indentation but rather on the depth of penetration.

3. **Vickers Hardness Test:**
   - **Principle:** Similar to the Brinell test, the Vickers hardness test also involves an indenter and calculates hardness based on indentation. However, it uses a diamond pyramid indenter and the angles of the pyramid faces. The Vickers hardness number (VHN) is calculated from the diagonal lengths of the square indentation.
   - **Formula:** \( \text{VHN} = \frac{1.854 \times P}{d^2} \)
     - Where \(P\) is the applied load and \(d\) is the diagonal length of the indentation.
   
4. **Knoop Hardness Test:**
   - **Principle:** Similar to the Vickers test, the Knoop hardness test uses a diamond indenter but with an elongated pyramidal shape. It measures hardness based on the long diagonal of the indentation.
   - **Application:** It's particularly used for brittle materials or thin sections where minimal penetration is desired.

5. **Shore Hardness Test:**
   - **Principle:** Commonly used for polymers, this test measures the resistance of material to indentation by a spring-loaded indenter. The principle is not based on area or depth but rather on the bounce-back height of the indenter.

Each of these tests has its own methodology and application based on the material type and the physical properties being measured. The Brinell hardness test is just one of several methods available, each suited to different scenarios, material characteristics, and hardness measurement needs.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.26
"A batch of annealed steel has just been received from the vendor. It is supposed to have a tensile strength in the range 60,000 -70,000 lb/in2. A Brinell hardness test in the receiving department yields a value of HB = 118. (a) Does the steel meet the specification on tensile strength?","Solution: (a) TS = 500(HB) = 500(118) = 59,000 lb/in2. This lies outside the specified range of 60,000 to 70,000 lb/in2. However, from a legal standpoint, it is unlikely that the batch can be rejected on the basis of its measured Brinell hardness number without using an actual tensile test to measure TS. The formula for converting from Brinell hardness number to tensile strength is only an approximating equation. ","To determine if the batch of annealed steel meets the tensile strength specification, we need to establish a relationship between the Brinell hardness number (HB) and tensile strength. A widely used empirical correlation between Brinell hardness and tensile strength for steel is given by:

\[ TS = k \times HB \]

where 
- \( TS \) is the tensile strength in psi (lb/in²),
- \( HB \) is the Brinell hardness number,
- \( k \) is a conversion factor which is approximately 500 psi for steel.

Using this relationship, we can estimate the tensile strength of the steel and see if it falls within the specified range of 60,000 - 70,000 lb/in².

Let's proceed with the calculation:

1. **Calculate the tensile strength (TS):**

   \[ TS = 500 \times 118 \]

   \[ TS = 59,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \]

2. **Compare the calculated TS to the specification range:**

   The specification range for tensile strength is 60,000 - 70,000 lb/in².

   The calculated tensile strength is 59,000 lb/in², which is just below the lower limit of the specified range.

3. **Conclusion:**

   Since the calculated tensile strength of 59,000 lb/in² is below the specified range of 60,000 - 70,000 lb/in², the batch of annealed steel does not meet the specification for tensile strength.

To summarize, the Brinell hardness test result (HB = 118) indicates that the tensile strength of the steel is approximately 59,000 lb/in². Therefore, the steel does not meet the required tensile strength specification.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.27

A Brinell hardness test in the receiving department yields a value of HB = 118. (b) Estimate the yield strength of the material.","Solution:  (b) Based on Table 3.2 in the text, the ratio of Y to TS for low carbon steel = 25,000/45,000 =0.555. Using this ratio, we can estimate the yield strength to be Y = 0.555(59,000) = 32,700 lb/in2.","To estimate the yield strength of the annealed steel based on the Brinell hardness number (HB), we can use an empirical relationship often employed in material science and manufacturing. This relationship correlates Brinell hardness to yield strength, especially for steels. The formula typically used is:

\[ \sigma_y \approx \frac{HB \times C}{\text{conversion factor}} \]

Where:
- \(\sigma_y\) is the yield strength.
- \(HB\) is the Brinell hardness number.
- \(C\) is an empirical constant that depends on the material (for steels, it is often around 0.5).
- The typical conversion factor for this relationship when considering PSI (pounds per square inch) is approximately 500.

Now, let's apply it to your situation:

1. **Identify the variables**:
   - Given: Brinell hardness number (\(HB\)) = 118
   - Empirical constant (\(C\)) = 0.5 (typical for steel)
   - Conversion factor = 500 (common for psi calculation)

2. **Substitute into the formula**:
   
\[
\sigma_y = \frac{118 \times 0.5}{500}
\]

\[
\sigma_y = \frac{59}{500}
\]

\[
\sigma_y = 0.118 \, \text{ksi or kpsi (thousand pounds per square inch)}
\]

This calculation indicates a misunderstanding, as typical yield strengths from Brinell hardness for steels should give a much larger value, generally in the tens of thousands of psi. Let's reevaluate and use the broader expression:

\[ 
\sigma_y \approx 0.5 \times HB \times 500 
\]

3. **Re-calculate with correct awareness**:
   
The formula should actually represent:

\[ 
\sigma_y \approx HB \times C 
\]

Where C typically implies actual tensile strength calculations. However, here in estimation for steel yield strength, which roughly estimates as:

\[ 
\sigma_y \approx HB \times 500 / 3 
\]

So:

\[ 
\sigma_y = 118 \times \frac{500}{3} \approx 19666.67 \text{ psi}
\]

Thus, the estimated yield strength of the material, based on the Brinell hardness number, is approximately 19,667 psi. 

Note: Considering empirical deviations, more precise testing may refine this estimate, and adjustments based on the specific steel grade might inform better accuracy.

Newton's law states that the shear stress (\(\tau\)) between fluid layers is directly proportional to the velocity gradient (\(\frac{du}{dy}\)), and the constant of proportionality is the coefficient of viscosity (\(\mu\)).

The relationship can be expressed as:

\[
\tau = \mu \cdot \frac{du}{dy}
\]

where:
- \(\tau\) is the shear stress,
- \(\mu\) is the coefficient of viscosity,
- \(\frac{du}{dy}\) is the velocity gradient.

1. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Shear stress, \(\tau = 10 \, \text{Pa}\)
   - Velocity of plates relative to each other, \(u = 5 \, \text{m/sec}\)
   - Separation (distance) between the plates, \(d = 4 \, \text{mm} = 0.004 \, \text{m}\)

2. **Assume Constant Velocity Gradient:**
   - Since the velocity gradient is constant, \(\frac{du}{dy}\) can be approximated by the change in velocity over the change in distance, or \(\frac{u}{d}\).

3. **Calculate the Velocity Gradient:**
   \[
   \frac{du}{dy} = \frac{u}{d} = \frac{5 \, \text{m/sec}}{0.004 \, \text{m}} = 1250 \, \text{sec}^{-1}

If the velocity gradient in the space between the surfaces is constant, determine the viscosity of the fluid.",Solution: Shear rate = (25 in/sec)/(0.5 in) = 50 sec-1 K = (0.3 lb/in2)/(50 sec-1) = 0.0006 lb-sec/in2.,"To determine the viscosity of the fluid, we can use the formula that relates shear stress (\(\tau\)), viscosity (\(\mu\)), and velocity gradient (\(du/dy\)) in a fluid. This relationship is given by Newton's law of viscosity:

\[
\tau = \mu \cdot \frac{du}{dy}

where:
- \(\tau\) is the shear stress,
- \(\mu\) is the dynamic viscosity,
- \(\frac{du}{dy}\) is the velocity gradient.

Given:
- Shear stress, \(\tau = 0.3 \, \text{lb/in}^2\),
- Velocity of the moving surface, \(u = 25 \, \text{in/sec}\),
- Distance between surfaces, \(y = 0.5 \, \text{in}\).

Since the velocity gradient (\(\frac{du}{dy}\)) is constant, it can be computed as the velocity difference (\(\Delta u\)) over the distance separating the surfaces (\(\Delta y\)). In this case, the velocity difference is the velocity of the moving surface because the other surface is stationary. Therefore, the velocity gradient is:

\[
\frac{du}{dy} = \frac{\Delta u}{\Delta y} = \frac{25 \, \text{in/sec}}{0.5 \, \text{in}} = 50 \, \text{sec}^{-1}

Now, use the shear stress formula to solve for the viscosity \(\mu\):

\[
0.3 \, \text{lb/in}^2 = \mu \cdot 50 \, \text{sec}^{-1}

Solving for \(\mu\):

\[
\mu = \frac{0.3 \, \text{lb/in}^2}{50 \, \text{sec}^{-1}} = 0.006 \, \text{lb-sec/in}^2

We'll approach this step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the System
- **Shaft diameter**: 125.0 mm
- **Bushing inside diameter**: 125.6 mm
- **Oil clearance**: 

The clearance (gap) \( h \) between the shaft and the bushing is:
\[ h = \frac{125.6 \, \text{mm} - 125.0 \, \text{mm}}{2} = 0.3 \, \text{mm} = 0.0003 \, \text{m} \]

- **Length of the bushing**: 50.0 mm = 0.050 m
- **Viscosity of the lubricating oil (η)**: 0.14 Pa·s
- **Rotational speed of the shaft**: 400 rev/min

### Step 2: Convert Rotational Speed to Rad/s
The rotational velocity \( \omega \) needs to be in radians per second (rad/s).
\[ \omega = 400 \, \text{rev/min} \times \frac{2\pi \, \text{rad}}{1 \, \text{rev}} \times \frac{1 \, \text{min}}{60 \, \text{s}} = \frac{400 \times 2\pi}{60} \approx 41.89 \, \text{rad/s} \]

### Step 3: Determine the Shear Stress
The shear stress \( \tau \) in the oil is given by:
\[ \tau = \eta \cdot \frac{dv}{dy} \]
where:
- \( dv \) is the change in velocity across the clearance.
- \( dy \) is the clearance gap.

Assuming linear velocity distribution across the gap (simple shear), the fluid velocity at the shaft surface is the tangential velocity \( v \) of the shaft:
\[ v = \omega \cdot r = 41.89 \, \text{rad/s} \times \frac{125.0}{2} \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} = 2.618 \, \text{m/s} \]

Thus, the shear rate \( \frac{dv}{dy} \) becomes:
\[ \frac{dv}{dy} = \frac{v}{h} = \frac{2.618 \, \text{m/s}}{0.0003 \, \text{m}} = 8726.67 \, \text{s}^{-1} \]

Then, the shear stress:
\[ \tau = 0.14 \, \text{Pa·s} \times 8726.67 \, \text{s}^{-1} = 1221.73 \, \text{Pa} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Torque Due to Viscosity
Torque (\( T \)) due to viscosity is determined by integrating the shear stress over the surface area of the shaft:
\[ T = \tau \cdot A \cdot r = \tau \cdot (2\pi r \cdot L) \cdot r \]

where:
- \( A = 2\pi r \cdot L \) is the cylindrical surface area.
- \( r = \frac{125.0}{2} \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} = 0.0625 \, \text{m} \)
- \( L = 0.050 \, \text{m} \)

Substitute the values:
\[ T = 1221.73 \, \text{Pa} \times (2\pi \times 0.0625 \, \text{m} \times 0.050 \, \text{m}) \times 0.0625 \, \text{m} \]

\[ T = 1221.73 \times 0.019635 \times 0.0625 \]

\[ T = 1221.73 \times 0.0012271875 \]

\[ T \approx 1.497 \, \text{Nm} \]

Thus, the magnitude of the torque due to viscosity that acts to resist the rotation of the shaft is approximately **1.497 Nm**.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.3

This involves understanding the physical principle of thermal contraction, which is the decrease in size of a material when it is cooled. The material contracts because its molecules move closer together as the temperature decreases.

While the exact details of Table 4.1 are not provided, I can guide you through typical steps needed to solve such a problem:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand Thermal Contraction:**
   - Thermal contraction can be described by the formula:
     \[
     \Delta L = \alpha \cdot L_0 \cdot \Delta T
     \]
     where:
     - \(\Delta L\) is the change in length (or diameter in this context),
     - \(\alpha\) is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion (per degree Celsius),
     - \(L_0\) is the original length (or diameter) of the material,
     - \(\Delta T\) is the change in temperature.

2. **Calculate the Change in Diameter:**
   - The change in diameter required is:
     \[
     \Delta D = D_{\text{original}} - D_{\text{final}} = 25.00 \, \text{mm} - 24.98 \, \text{mm} = 0.02 \, \text{mm}
     \]

3. **Coefficient of Linear Thermal Expansion:**
   - Typically given in the problem or a referenced table (such as your Table 4.1). For carbon steel, a common material for shafts, \(\alpha\) might be approximately \(11 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C}^{-1}\).

4. **Rearrange Thermal Contraction Formula:**
   - Rearrange the formula to solve for \(\Delta T\):
     \[
     \Delta T = \frac{\Delta D}{\alpha \cdot L_0}
     \]
   - Substituting the given values (\(L_0 = 25.00\, \text{mm}\), \(\Delta D = 0.02\, \text{mm}\), \(\alpha = 11 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C}^{-1}\)):
     \[
     \Delta T = \frac{0.02 \, \text{mm}}{11 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C}^{-1} \times 25.00 \, \text{mm}}
     \]
     \[
     \Delta T = \frac{0.02}{0.000275}
     \]
     \[
     \Delta T \approx 72.73 \, \text{C}
     \]

5. **Calculate Final Temperature:**
   - The initial temperature (\(T_{\text{initial}}\)) is 20°C. Therefore, the final temperature will be:
     \[
     T_{\text{final}} = T_{\text{initial}} - \Delta T = 20 \, \text{C} - 72.73 \, \text{C} = -52.73 \, \text{C}
     \]

Thus, to reduce the diameter of the shaft to 24.98 mm, it must be cooled to approximately \(-52.73\) °C.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Understand Thermal Expansion
The change in volume of a solid due to a change in temperature can be calculated using the formula for linear expansion, assuming isotropic material:

\[
\Delta V = V_0 \times \beta \times \Delta T
\]

where:
- \( \Delta V \) is the change in volume,
- \( V_0 \) is the initial volume,
- \( \beta \) is the volumetric expansion coefficient,
- \( \Delta T \) is the change in temperature.

### Step 2: Coefficient of Thermal Expansion
The coefficient of linear thermal expansion (\( \alpha \)) for aluminum is approximately \( 24 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{°C}^{-1} \). The volumetric coefficient (\( \beta \)) is about three times the linear coefficient:

\[
\beta = 3 \times \alpha = 3 \times 24 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{°C}^{-1} = 72 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{°C}^{-1}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \Delta T \)
\[
\Delta T = 650°C - 20°C = 630°C
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Change in Volume
Substitute these values into the volumetric expansion formula:

\[
\Delta V = V_0 \times 72 \times 10^{-6} \times 630
\]

The above expression calculates the fractional increase in volume. This increase is on the order of approximately 4.536%.

### Step 5: Calculate New Volume
The new volume \( V \) is:

\[
V = V_0 + \Delta V = V_0 (1 + 0.04536)
\]

Since density (\( \rho \)) is mass divided by volume and assuming mass remains constant, the density at 650°C is:

\[
\rho = \frac{\rho_0}{1 + 0.04536}
\]

Given \( \rho_0 = 2.70 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \),

\[
\rho = \frac{2.70}{1.04536} \approx 2.58 \, \text{g/cm}^3
\]

### Conclusion
The density of aluminum at 650°C is approximately \( 2.58 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \). This calculation accounts for the volumetric expansion due to the temperature increase.","# TABLE  •  6.1   (continued): (f) Titanium.

as an ore because of its higher Ti content. In recovery of the metal from its ores, the  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  is converted to titanium tetrachloride  $\mathrm{(TiCl_{4})}$  by reacting the compound with  chlorine gas. This is followed by a sequence of distillation steps to remove impurities.  The  highly concentrated  $\mathrm{TiCl_{4}}$  is then reduced to metallic titanium by reaction with  magnesium; this is known as the  Kroll process . Sodium can also be used as a reduc-  ing agent. In either case, an inert atmosphere must be maintained to prevent $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ , $\mathbf{N}_{2}$ ,  or $\mathrm{H}_{2}$  from contaminating the Ti, owing to its chemical affinity for these gases. The  resulting metal is used to cast ingots of titanium and its alloys.  

Properties of Titanium  Ti’s coefficient of thermal expansion is relatively low  among metals. It is stiffer and stronger than aluminum, and it retains good strength  at elevated temperatures. Pure titanium is reactive, which presents problems in  processing, especially in the molten state. However, at room temperature it forms  a thin adherent oxide coating $\left(\mathrm{TiO}_{2}\right)$  that provides excellent corrosion resistance.  

These properties give rise to two principal application areas for titanium: (1) in  the commercially pure state, Ti is used for corrosion resistant components, such as  marine components and prosthetic implants; and (2) titanium alloys are used as  high-strength components in temperatures ranging from ambient to above  $550^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ $(1000^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ), especially where its excellent strength-to-weight ratio is exploited. These  latter applications include aircraft and missile components. Some of the alloying  elements used with titanium include aluminum, manganese, tin, and vanadium.

"With reference to Table 4.1, determine the increase in length of a steel bar whose length = 10.0 in, if the bar is heated from room temperature of 70F to 500F.",Solution: Increase = (6.7 x 10^-6 in/in/F)(10.0 in)(500F -70F) = 0.0288 in.,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the increase in length of a steel bar due to thermal expansion. We'll use the formula:

\[
L_{2} - L_{1} = a L_{1} (T_{2} - T_{1})
\]

Where:
- \(L_{1} = 10.0\) inches
- \(T_{1} = 70^\circ F\)
- \(T_{2} = 500^\circ F\)
- \(a =\) coefficient of thermal expansion

### Steps:

1. **Identify the Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (\(a\)):**
   - Look up the coefficient of thermal expansion for steel in Table 4.1 (which isn't provided here). Let's assume for our calculation that \(a = 6.5 \times 10^{-6}\, ^\circ F^{-1}\), which is a typical value for steel.

2. **Calculate the Temperature Change (\(T_{2} - T_{1}\)):**
   \[
   T_{2} - T_{1} = 500^\circ F - 70^\circ F = 430^\circ F
   \]

3. **Plug the Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   L_{2} - L_{1} = (6.5 \times 10^{-6}\, ^\circ F^{-1}) \times (10.0 \text{ in}) \times (430^\circ F)
   \]

4. **Calculate the Increase in Length:**
   \[
   L_{2} - L_{1} = 6.5 \times 10^{-6} \times 10 \times 430 = 0.02795 \text{ in}
   \]

Thus, the increase in length of the steel bar when heated from 70°F to 500°F is approximately \(0.028\) inches.","The change in  length corresponding to a given temperature change is given by:  

$$
L_{2}-L_{1}=a L_{1}\left(T_{2}-T_{1}\right)
$$  

where $a=$   coefficient of thermal expansion, $^{\circ}\mathbf{C}^{\cdot1}(^{\circ}\mathbf{F}^{\cdot1})$ ; and $L_{1}$  and $L_{2}$  are lengths,  mm (in), corresponding, respectively, to temperatures $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2},\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\ (^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ .  

Values of coefficient of thermal expansion given in Table 4.1 suggest that it has  a linear relationship with temperature. This is only an approximation. Not only is  length affected by temperature, but the thermal expansion coefficient itself is also  affected. For some materials it increases with temperature; for other materials it  decreases. These changes are usually not significant enough to be of much concern,  and values like those in the table are quite useful in design calculations for the range  of temperatures contemplated in service. Changes in the coefficient are more sub-  stantial when the metal undergoes a phase transformation, such as from solid to  liquid, or from one crystal structure to another.  

In manufacturing operations, thermal expansion is put to good use in shrink fit  and expansion fit assemblies (Section 31.3), in which a part is heated to increase its  size or cooled to decrease its size to permit insertion into some other part. When the  part returns to ambient temperature, a tightly fitted assembly is obtained. Thermal  expansion can be a problem in heat treatment (Chapter 26) and welding (Section  29.6) because of thermal stresses that develop in the material during these processes.  

# 4.1.3  MELTING  CHARACTERISTICS  

For a pure element, the  melting point $T_{m}$   is the temperature at which the mate- rial  transforms from solid to liquid state. The reverse transformation, from liquid to  solid,  occurs at the same temperature and is called the  freezing point . For crystalline  elements,  such as metals, the melting and freezing temperatures are the same. A cer- tain  amount of heat energy, called the  heat of fusion , is required at this temperature to  accomplish the transformation from solid to liquid.  

Melting of a metal element at a specific temperature assumes equilibrium condi-  tions. Exceptions occur in nature; for example, when a molten metal is cooled, it may  remain in the liquid state below its freezing point if nucleation of crystals does not  initiate immediately. When this happens, the liquid is said to be  supercooled .  

There are other variations in the melting process—differences in the way melt-  ing occurs in different materials. For example, unlike pure metals, most metal alloys  do not have a single melting point. Instead, melting begins at a certain temperature,   called the  solidus , and continues as   the temperature increases until finally convert-  ing completely to the liquid state at a temperature called the  liquidus . Between the  two temperatures, the alloy is a mixture of solid and molten metals, the amounts of  each being inversely proportional to their relative distances from the liquidus and  solidus. Although most alloys behave in this way, exceptions are eutectic alloys that

melt (and freeze) at a single temperature. These issues are examined in the discus-  sion of phase diagrams in Chapter 6.  

Another difference in melting occurs with noncrystalline materials (glasses). In  these materials, there is a gradual transition from solid to liquid states. The solid  material gradually softens as temperature increases, finally becoming liquid at the  melting point. During softening, the material has a consistency of increasing plasticity  (increasingly like a fluid) as it gets closer to the melting point.  

These differences in melting characteristics among pure metals, alloys, and glass  are portrayed in Figure 4.1.",/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec12456.txt,0.8245464790872836,4.0,4.4

1. **Determine the Volume of the Aluminum Block:**
   The dimensions of the block are 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm.
   \[
   V = 10 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} = 1000 \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

2. **Determine the Density of Aluminum:**
   Typically, aluminum has a density of about 2.7 g/cm³.

3. **Calculate the Mass of the Aluminum Block:**
   \[
   \text{Mass} = \text{Density} \times \text{Volume} = 2.7 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \times 1000 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2700 \, \text{g}
   \]

4. **Determine the Specific Heat of Aluminum:**
   From common references, the specific heat capacity (\(C_s\)) of aluminum in the solid state is approximately 0.897 J/g°C.

5. **Initial and Final Temperatures:**
   - Initial temperature (\(T_o\)) = 21°C
   - Final temperature (\(T_p\)) = 300°C

6. **Calculate the Amount of Heat Required (\(H\)):**
   The formula for calculating heat (ignoring phase changes since aluminum remains solid from room temperature to 300°C) is given by:

   \[
   H = \text{Mass} \times C_s \times (T_p - T_o)
   \]

   Substituting in the known values:

   \[
   H = 2700 \, \text{g} \times 0.897 \, \text{J/g°C} \times (300°C - 21°C)
   \]

   Simplifying further:

   \[
   H = 2700 \, \text{g} \times 0.897 \, \text{J/g°C} \times 279°C
   \]

   \[
   H = 2700 \times 0.897 \times 279 = 675,567.9 \, \text{J}

Therefore, approximately 675,568 Joules of heat are required to raise the temperature of the aluminum block from 21°C to 300°C.","In permanent metal molds, small vent holes are drilled into the mold or  machined into the parting line to permit removal of air and gases.  

#  Heating and Pouring  

To perform a casting operation, the metal must be heated to a temperature some- what above its melting point and then poured into the mold cavity to solidify. Several  aspects of these two steps are discussed in this section.  

# 10.2.1  HEATING THE METAL  

Heating furnaces of various kinds (Section 11.4.1) are used to heat the metal to a  molten temperature sufﬁ  cient for casting. The heat energy required is the sum of (1)  the heat to raise the temperature to the melting point, (2) the heat of fusion to con- vert it from solid to liquid, and (3) the heat to raise the molten metal to the desired  temperature for pouring. This can be expressed:  

$$
H=\rho\,V\{C_{s}\,(T_{m}-\,T_{o})+\,H_{f}+\,C_{l}\,(T_{p}\,-\,T_{m})\}
$$  

where  $H=$  total heat required to raise the temperature of the metal to the pour- ing temperature, J (Btu); $\rho=$  density,  $\mathrm{{g}/\mathrm{{cm}}^{3}}$   $\left(1\mathrm{b}\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{in}^{3}\right)$ ;  $C_{s}=$  weight speciﬁ  c heat for  the solid metal,  $\mathrm{J/g-C}$  (Btu/lbm-F);  $T_{m}=$  melting temperature of the metal, C (F);  $T_{o}=$  starting temperature—usually ambient,  $\mathrm{C}$  (F);  $H_{f}=$  heat of fusion,  $\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{g}$  ( $\mathrm{{'Bup/}}$ lbm);  $C_{1}=$  weight speciﬁ  c heat of the liquid metal, $\mathrm{J/g-C}$  (Btu/lbm-F);  $T_{p}=$  pouring  temperature, C (F); and  $V=$  volume of metal being heated, $\mathrm{cm}^{3}\left(\mathrm{in}^{3}\right)$ .  

# Example 10.1  Heating metal  for casting  

One cubic meter of a certain eutectic alloy is heated in a crucible from room  temperature to $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  above its melting point for casting. The alloy’s density $=$ $7.5\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , melting point $=800^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , speciﬁ  c heat $=0.33\;\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{g}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  in the solid state  and $0.29\,\mathrm{J/g^{\circ}C}$  in the liquid state; and heat of fusion $=160\,\mathrm{J/g}$ . How much heat  energy must be added to accomplish the heating, assuming no losses?  

Solution :  Assume ambient temperature in the foundry $=25^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and that the  density of the liquid and solid states of the metal are the same. Noting that one  $\mathsf{m}^{3}=10^{6}\,\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , and substituting the property values into Equation (10.1),  

$H=(7.5)\,(10^{6})\{0.33(800-25)+160+0.29\,(100)\}=3335(10^{6})\,\mathrm{J}$ The above equation is of conceptual value, but its computational value is limited,  

notwithstanding the calculation in Example 10.1. Use of Equation (10.1) is com- plicated by the following factors: (1) Speciﬁ  c heat and other thermal properties of  a solid metal vary with temperature, especially if the metal undergoes a change of  phase during heating. (2) A metal’s speciﬁ  c heat may be different in the solid and  liquid states.",/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec10.txt,0.826610740453086,4.0,4.5

\[
R = \rho \frac{L}{A}
\]

where:
- \( R \) is the resistance,
- \( \rho \) is the resistivity of the material,
- \( L \) is the length of the wire,
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the wire.

### Steps:

1. **Find the Cross-sectional Area \( A \):**
   - Given the diameter of the wire is \( 0.10 \, \text{mm} \), convert it to meters: 
     \[
     0.10 \, \text{mm} = 0.10 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} = 0.0001 \, \text{m}

   - The radius \( r \) is half of the diameter:
     \[
     r = \frac{0.0001}{2} \, \text{m} = 0.00005 \, \text{m}
     \]
   - Calculate the cross-sectional area \( A \) using:
     \[
     A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.00005)^2 \approx 7.85 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}^2

2. **Length of the Wire \( L \):**
   - The length \( L \) is given as \( 10 \, \text{m} \).

3. **Resistivity of Copper \( \rho \):**
   - Typically, the resistivity of copper is about \( 1.68 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \).

4. **Calculate the Resistance \( R \):**
   \[
   R = \rho \frac{L}{A} = (1.68 \times 10^{-8}) \frac{10}{7.85 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 0.0214 \, \Omega

FIGURE 29.12  Resistance welding  (RW), showing the  components in  spot welding, the  predominant process in  the RW group.  

The current used in resistance welding operations is very high (5000–20,000 A,  typically), although voltage is relatively low (usually below  $10\,\mathrm{V}$ ). The duration $t$  of  the current is short in most processes, perhaps lasting 0.1 to  $0.4~\mathrm{s}$  in a typical spot- welding operation.  

The reason why such a high current is used in RW is because (1) the squared term  in Equation (29.3) ampliﬁ  es the effect of current, and (2) the resistance is very low  (around  $0.0001\;\Omega$ ). Resistance in the welding circuit is the sum of (1) resistance of  the electrodes, (2) resistances of the work parts, (3) contact resistances between elec- trodes and work parts, and (4) contact resistance of the faying surfaces. Thus, heat  is generated in all of these regions of electrical resistance. The ideal situation is for  the faying surfaces to be the largest resistance in the sum, because this is the desired  location of the weld. The resistance of the electrodes is minimized by using metals  with very low resistivities, such as copper. Also, the electrodes are often water cooled  to dissipate the heat that is generated there. The work part resistances are a function  of the resistivities of the base metals and the part thicknesses. The contact resist- ances between the electrodes and the parts are determined by the contact areas (i.e.,  size and shape of the electrode) and the condition of the surfaces (e.g., cleanliness  of the work surfaces and scale on the electrode). Finally, the resistance at the faying  surfaces depends on surface ﬁ  nish, cleanliness, contact area, and pressure. No paint,  oil, dirt, or other contaminants should be present to separate the contacting surfaces.  

# Example 29.2  Resistance  welding  

A resistance spot-welding operation performed on two pieces of $2.5\mathrm{-mm}$ -thick  sheet steel uses 12,000 amps for a 0.20-s duration. The electrodes are  $6\,\mathrm{mm}$  in  diameter at the contacting surfaces. Resistance is assumed to be $0.0001\;\Omega$ , and  the resulting weld nugget $6\:\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter and averages $3\:\mathrm{mm}$  in thickness.  The unit melting energy for the metal  $U_{m}=12.0\:\mathrm{J/mm}^{3}$ . What portion of the  heat generated was used to form the weld nugget, and what portion was dis- sipated into the work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air?  

Solution:   The heat generated in the operation is given by Equation (29.3) as.  

$$
H=(12,\!000)^{2}(0.0001)(0.2)=2880\,\mathrm{J}
$$  

The volume of the weld nugget (assumed disc-shaped) is  $\nu=3.0\frac{\pi(6)^{2}}{4}=$ $84.8\;\mathrm{mm}^{3}$ .  

The heat required to melt this volume of metal is  $H w=84.8(12.0)=\mathbf{1018\,J}$ .   The remaining heat,  $\begin{array}{r}{2880{-}1018=1862\;\mathbf{J}}\end{array}$   $(64.7\%$  of the total), is lost into the  work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air. In effect, this loss represents  the combined effect of the heat transfer factor $f_{1}$  and melting factor $f_{2}$   (Section 28.3.2).",/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec29.txt,0.8188030926666459,4.0,4.6

Since nickel is a metal, the resistivity would increase, causing the resistance to increase. This, in turn, would cause slightly more heat to be generated.","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the resistance of the nickel wire and understand how temperature affects its resistance. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

### (a) Calculating the Resistance of the Wire

**Step 1: Determine the Resistivity of Nickel**

First, we need the resistivity of nickel. Since we don't have access to Table 4.3, I will provide a typical value for nickel. Nickel has a resistivity (\(\rho\)) of approximately \(6.99 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot m\). 

**Step 2: Convert Wire Length to Meters**

The total length \(L\) of the wire is 32.8 feet. Convert this to meters:
\[ L = 32.8 \, \text{ft} \times 0.3048 \, \text{m/ft} = 9.99744 \, \text{m} \]

**Step 3: Convert the Diameter to Meters and Calculate the Cross-sectional Area**

The diameter \(d\) of the wire is given as 0.0508 inches. Convert this to meters:
\[ d = 0.0508 \, \text{inches} \times 0.0254 \, \text{m/in} = 0.00129032 \, \text{m} \]

Calculate the cross-sectional area \(A\) using the formula for the area of a circle (\(A = \pi r^2\)):
\[ A = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \left(\frac{0.00129032}{2}\right)^2 \approx 1.307 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2 \]

**Step 4: Use the Resistance Formula**

The resistance \(R\) of the wire is given by the formula:
\[ R = \rho \frac{L}{A} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ R = \left(6.99 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot m\right) \frac{9.99744 \, \text{m}}{1.307 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2} \]

\[ R \approx 0.533 \, \Omega \]

So, the resistance of the wire is approximately \(0.533 \, \Omega\).

### (b) Effect of Temperature on Resistance

When current flows through the wire, it generates heat due to the resistance. Heating the wire affects its resistance because the resistivity of most metals, including nickel, increases with temperature. Generally, the relationship between temperature and resistance for metals can be described using the temperature coefficient of resistivity:

\[ R_T = R_0 \times (1 + \alpha \times \Delta T) \]

Where:

- \(R_T\) is the resistance at temperature \(T\).
- \(R_0\) is the original resistance.
- \(\alpha\) is the temperature coefficient of resistance for nickel (usually around \(0.006 \, \text{per degree Celsius}\)).
- \(\Delta T\) is the change in temperature.

As the temperature increases, the collision rate between electrons and the metal ions increases, which in turn increases the resistance. Therefore, the wire’s resistance will increase as it heats up due to the passage of current. This could be an important consideration in designing circuits, as increased resistance could affect performance or necessitate changes in voltage or current to achieve desired outcomes.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,4.0,4.7

" A tensile test uses a test specimen that has a gage length of 50 mm and an area = 200 mm2. During the test the specimen yields under a load of 98,000 N. The corresponding gage length = 50.23 mm. 
This is the 0.2 percent yield point. The maximum load of 168,000 N is reached at a gage length = 
64.2 mm. D. Determine (a) yield strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, and (c) tensile strength. ","Solution: (a) Y = 98,000/200 = 490 MPa. (b) s = E e Subtracting the 0.2% offset, e = (50.23 -50.0)/50.0 -0.002 = 0.0026 E = s/e = 490/0.0026 = 188.5 x 103 MPa.  (c) TS = 168,000/200 = 840 MPa.  ","To solve this problem, we need to find the yield strength, modulus of elasticity, and tensile strength based on the given data from a tensile test.

### Given:
- Initial gage length, \( L_0 = 50 \) mm
- Initial cross-sectional area, \( A_0 = 200 \) mm\(^2\)
- Load at yield, \( F_y = 98,000 \) N
- Gage length at yield, \( L_y = 50.23 \) mm
- Maximum load, \( F_{\text{max}} = 168,000 \) N
- Gage length at maximum load, \( L_{\text{max}} = 64.2 \) mm

### (a) Yield Strength:

Yield strength is determined by the yield load divided by the original cross-sectional area.

\[
\sigma_y = \frac{F_y}{A_0}
\]

\[
\sigma_y = \frac{98,000 \, \text{N}}{200 \, \text{mm}^2} = 490 \, \text{N/mm}^2
\]

So, the yield strength is 490 N/mm\(^2\) or 490 MPa.

### (b) Modulus of Elasticity:

The modulus of elasticity can be calculated using the yield point data since it represents the onset of plastic deformation. The formula for the modulus of elasticity (\(E\)) is:

\[
E = \frac{\sigma_y}{\epsilon_y}
\]

Where the strain at yield, \(\epsilon_y\), is:

\[
\epsilon_y = \frac{L_y - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{50.23 \, \text{mm} - 50 \, \text{mm}}{50 \, \text{mm}} = \frac{0.23}{50} = 0.0046
\]

Now, calculate \(E\):

\[
E = \frac{490 \, \text{N/mm}^2}{0.0046} = 106,521.74 \, \text{N/mm}^2
\]

So, the modulus of elasticity is approximately 106,522 MPa (rounded to the nearest whole number).

### (c) Tensile Strength:

Tensile strength is the maximum load the specimen can handle divided by the original cross-sectional area.

\[
\sigma_{\text{max}} = \frac{F_{\text{max}}}{A_0}
\]

\[
\sigma_{\text{max}} = \frac{168,000 \, \text{N}}{200 \, \text{mm}^2} = 840 \, \text{N/mm}^2
\]

So, the tensile strength is 840 N/mm\(^2\) or 840 MPa.

"A test specimen in a tensile test has a gage length of 2.0 in and an area = 0.5 in2. During the test the specimen yields under a load of 32,000 lb. The corresponding gage length = 2.0083 in. This is the 0.2 percent yield point. The maximum load of 60,000 lb is reached at a gage length = 2.60 in. Determine (a) yield strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, and (c) tensile strength. (d) If fracture occurs at a gage length of 2.92 in, determine the percent elongation. (e) If the specimen necked to an area = 0.25 in2, determine the percent reduction in area.","Solution: (a) Y = 32,000/0.5 = 64,000 lb/in2 (b) s = E e Subtracting the 0.2% offset, e = (2.0083 -2.0)/2.0 -0.002 = 0.00215 E = s/e = 64,000/0.00215 = 29.77 x 106 lb/in2  (c) TS = 60,000/0.5 = 120,000 lb/in2  (d) EL = (2.92 -2.0)/2.0 = 0.92/2.0 = 0.46 = 46%  (e) AR = (0.5 -0.25)/0.5 = 0.50 = 50%","To solve this problem, we need to determine several mechanical properties of the material being tested in the tensile test: yield strength, modulus of elasticity, tensile strength, percent elongation, and percent reduction in area. Let's tackle each part one by one.

### (a) Yield Strength
Yield strength is the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically. In this test, the yield occurs at a load of 32,000 lb with an original cross-sectional area of 0.5 in².

\[
\text{Yield Strength} = \frac{\text{Load at yield}}{\text{Original cross-sectional area}}
\]

\[
\text{Yield Strength} = \frac{32,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} = 64,000 \, \text{psi}
\]

### (b) Modulus of Elasticity
The modulus of elasticity is determined using the stress-strain relationship within the elastic region. The 0.2 percent offset method is often used in practice, but we assume linear elasticity here, directly computing from the elastic portion.

Strain at yield:

\[
\text{Strain} = \frac{\text{Change in length at yield}}{\text{Original length}} = \frac{2.0083 \, \text{in} - 2.0 \, \text{in}}{2.0 \, \text{in}} = 0.00415
\]

Modulus of Elasticity (E) can be calculated as:

\[
E = \frac{\text{Yield Strength}}{\text{Strain at yield}}
\]

\[
E = \frac{64,000 \, \text{psi}}{0.00415} \approx 15,421,686.75 \, \text{psi}
\]

### (c) Tensile Strength
Tensile strength is the maximum stress the material can withstand. This corresponds to the maximum load applied during the tensile test at the original cross-sectional area.

\[
\text{Tensile Strength} = \frac{\text{Maximum load}}{\text{Original cross-sectional area}}
\]

\[
\text{Tensile Strength} = \frac{60,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} = 120,000 \, \text{psi}
\]

### (d) Percent Elongation
Percent elongation is the total increase in the gage length expressed as a percentage of the original gage length, measured after fracture.

\[
\text{Percent Elongation} = \left( \frac{\text{Final gage length} - \text{Original gage length}}{\text{Original gage length}} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percent Elongation} = \left( \frac{2.92 \, \text{in} - 2.0 \, \text{in}}{2.0 \, \text{in}} \right) \times 100 = 46\%
\]

### (e) Percent Reduction in Area
Percent reduction in area considers the decrease in cross-sectional area at the point of necking.

\[
\text{Percent Reduction in Area} = \left( \frac{\text{Original area} - \text{Final area at neck}}{\text{Original area}} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percent Reduction in Area} = \left( \frac{0.5 \, \text{in}^2 - 0.25 \, \text{in}^2}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
\]

On the x-axis (strain) and y-axis (stress), plot the points calculated above. Connect the points to form the stress-strain curve.

### Step 3: Analyze the Stress-Strain Curve

#### (b) Yield Strength:
The yield strength is approximated from the stress-strain curve as the stress at which the curve first deviates from linearity. From the trend:
- Approximate yield strength may be slightly before true linear deviates. Here, we can take it as near \(\sigma_1 = 284.69 \, \text{MPa}\).

#### (c) Modulus of Elasticity (E):

A tensile test for a certain metal provides flow curve parameters: strain-hardening exponent is 0.3 and strength coefficient is 600 MPa. Determine (a) the flow stress at a true strain = 1.0 and (b) true strain at a flow stress = 600 MPa.,Solution: (a) Yf = 600(1.0)^.3 = 600 MPa (b) H = (600/600)^(1/.3) = (1.0)^3.33 = 1.00,"To solve this problem, we'll use the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = K \epsilon^n
\]

where:
- \(\sigma\) is the flow stress,
- \(K\) is the strength coefficient,
- \(\epsilon\) is the true strain,
- \(n\) is the strain-hardening exponent.

Given:
- \(K = 600 \, \text{MPa}\)
- \(n = 0.3\)

### (a) Calculate the flow stress at a true strain of \(\epsilon = 1.0\).

Substitute the given values into the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = 600 \times (1.0)^{0.3}
\]

Since \(1.0^{0.3} = 1.0\), this simplifies to:

\[
\sigma = 600 \, \text{MPa}
\]

### (b) Calculate the true strain at a flow stress of \(\sigma = 600 \, \text{MPa}\).

Rearrange the flow curve equation to solve for \(\epsilon\):

\[
600 = 600 \epsilon^{0.3}
\]

Divide both sides by 600:

\[
1 = \epsilon^{0.3}
\]

Raise both sides to the power of \(\frac{1}{0.3}\):

\[
\epsilon = 1.0
\]

### Final Answer:
(a) The flow stress at a true strain of 1.0 is \(600 \, \text{MPa}\).

(b) The true strain at a flow stress of \(600 \, \text{MPa}\) is 1.0.","Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.  

![](images/2568ff5aca665b9fc84e7b1a562fccf1c25a27242085edc83566c161baa241a7.jpg)  
FIGURE 3.5  True stress–strain  curve plotted on log–log scale.  

Because it is a straight line in this transformation of the data, the relationship  between true stress and true strain in the plastic region can be expressed as  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

This equation is called the  ﬂ  ow curve , and it provides a good approximation of the  behavior of metals in the plastic region, including their capacity for strain hardening.  The constant $K$  is called the  strength coefﬁ  cient , MPa  $(1{\mathrm{b}}/{\mathrm{in}}^{2}),$  and it equals the value  of true stress at a true strain value equal to one. The parameter  $n$  is called the  strain  hardening exponent , and it is the slope of the line in Figure 3.5. Its value is directly  related to a metal’s tendency to work harden. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for selected  metals are given in Table 3.4.

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine the strength coefﬁ  cient and  strain hardening exponent in the ﬂ  ow curve equation: $\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}$ .  

Solution:  We have two points on the ﬂ  ow curve from which the ﬂ  ow curve  parameters can be determined: (1) at the yield point and (2) at the maximum  load.  

(1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ . (1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ .  

Solving for $n$  and $K$ ,  

(1) $K=160/(0.001998)^{n}$  and (2) $K=375/(0.143)^{n}$   $160/(0.001998)^{n}=375/(0.143)^{n}$  

 $\ln(160)-n\ln(0.001998)=\ln(375)-n\ln(0.143$  ln(0.143)

 $5.0752-(-6.2156)n=5.9269-(-1.9449)n

$ $5.0752+6.2156n=5.9269+1.9449n

$ $(6.2156-1.9449)n=5.9269-5.0752

$ $4.2707n=0.8517$        $n=0.1994$ Substituting back into (1): $K=160/(0.001998)^{0.1994}=552.7$ .  

Check:  Using (2):  $K=375/(0.143)^{0.1994}=552.7.$  

The ﬂ  ow curve equation is $\sigma={\tt552.7}\epsilon^{\tt0.1994}$ .  

Necking in a tensile test and in metal forming operations that stretch the work  part is closely related to strain hardening. As the test specimen is elongated during  the initial part of the test (before necking begins), uniform straining occurs through- out the length because if any element in the specimen becomes strained more than  the surrounding metal, its strength increases by work hardening, thus making it  more resistant to additional strain until the surrounding metal has been strained  an equal amount. Finally, the strain becomes so large that uniform straining cannot  be sustained. A weak point in the length develops (from buildup of dislocations at  grain boundaries, impurities in the metal, or other factors), and necking is initiated,  leading to failure. Empirical evidence reveals that necking begins for a particular  metal when the true strain reaches a value equal to the strain-hardening exponent $n$ .  Therefore, a higher $n$  value means that the metal can be strained further before the  onset of necking during tensile loading.  

Types of Stress–Strain Relationships  Much information about elastic–plastic  behavior is provided by the true stress–strain curve. As indicated, Hooke’s law  ( $\mathit{(\sigma=E\epsilon)}$ ) governs the metal’s behavior in the elastic region, and the ﬂ  ow curve  

![](images/8d5e447efc041717923fec58799d69344712cc5d7450b72b50acbece2dd1e56f.jpg)  
FIGURE 3.6  Three  categories of stress– strain relationship:  (a) perfectly elastic,  (b) elastic and perfectly  plastic, and (c) elastic  and strain hardening.  

$(\sigma\,=\,K\epsilon^{n})$ ) determines the behavior in the plastic region. Three basic forms of  stress–strain relationship describe the behavior of nearly all types of solid materi- als, shown in Figure 3.6:  

(a)  Perfectly elastic . The behavior of this material is deﬁ  ned completely by its stiff- ness, indicated by the modulus of elasticity  $\mathcal{L}$ . It fractures rather than yielding  to plastic ﬂ  ow. Brittle materials such as ceramics, many cast irons, and thermo- setting polymers possess stress–strain curves that fall into this category. The typical stress–strain relationship for a metal exhibits elasticity below the  yield point and strain hardening above it. Figures 3.4 and 3.5 indicate this behavior  in linear and logarithmic axes. In the plastic region, the metal’s behavior is expressed  by the ﬂ  ow curve:  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

where $K=$  the strength coefﬁ  cient, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ; and $n$  is the strain hardening expo- nent. The stress  $\sigma$  and strain  $\epsilon$  in the ﬂ  ow curve are true stress and true strain. The  ﬂ  ow curve is generally valid as a relationship that deﬁ  nes a metal’s plastic behavior  in cold working. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for different metals at room temperature  are listed in Table 3.4.  

Flow Stress  The ﬂ  ow curve describes the stress–strain relationship in the region  in which metal forming takes place. It indicates the ﬂ  ow stress of the metal—the  strength property that determines forces and power required to accomplish a par- ticular forming operation. For most metals at room temperature, the stress–strain  plot of Figure 3.5 indicates that as the metal is deformed, its strength increases  due to strain hardening. The stress required to continue deformation must be  increased to match this increase in strength.  Flow stress  is deﬁ  ned as the instan- taneous value of stress required to continue deforming the material—to keep the  metal “ﬂ  owing.” It is the yield strength of the metal as a function of strain, which  can be expressed:  

$$
Y_{f}=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

where  $Y_{f}=$  ﬂ  ow stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ .  

In the individual forming operations discussed in the following two chapters, the  instantaneous ﬂ  ow stress can be used to analyze the process as it is occurring. For  example, in certain forging operations, the instantaneous force during compression  can be determined from the ﬂ  ow stress value. Maximum force can be calculated  based on the ﬂ  ow stress that results from the ﬁ  nal strain at the end of the forging  stroke.  

In other cases, the analysis is based on the average stresses and strains that occur  during deformation rather than instantaneous values. Extrusion represents this case,  Figure 17.2(c). As the billet is reduced in cross section to pass through the extrusion  die opening, the metal gradually strain hardens to reach a maximum value. Rather  than determine a sequence of instantaneous stress–strain values during the reduc- tion, which would be not only difﬁ  cult but also of limited interest, it is more useful to  analyze the process based on the average ﬂ  ow stress during deformation.  

Average Flow Stress  The average ﬂ  ow stress (also called the  mean ﬂ  ow stress ) is  the average value of stress over the stress–strain curve from the beginning of strain  to the ﬁ  nal (maximum) value that occurs during deformation. The value is illustrated  in the stress–strain plot of Figure 17.4. The average ﬂ  ow stress is determined by inte- grating the ﬂ  ow curve equation, Equation (17.1), between zero and the ﬁ  nal strain  value deﬁ  ning the range of interest. This yields the equation:  

$$
\overline{{Y}}_{f}=\frac{K\epsilon^{n}}{1+n}
$$

"The flow curve for a certain metal has a strain-hardening exponent of 0.22 and strength coefficient of 54,000 lb/in2. Determine (a) the flow stress at a true strain = 0.45 and (b) the true strain at a flow stress = 40,000 lb/in2.","Solution: (a) Yf = 54,000(0.45)^.22 = 45,300 lb/in2 (b) H = (40,000/54,000)^(1/.22) = (0.7407)^4.545 = 0.256","To solve the given problem, we use the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = K \epsilon^n
\]

where:
- \(\sigma\) is the flow stress,
- \(K\) is the strength coefficient (\(54,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2\)),
- \(\epsilon\) is the true strain,
- \(n\) is the strain-hardening exponent (\(0.22\)).

### Part (a): Determine the flow stress at a true strain \( \epsilon = 0.45 \).

Substitute the given values into the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = 54,000 \times (0.45)^{0.22}
\]

Calculate:

1. Compute \((0.45)^{0.22}\):
   \[
   (0.45)^{0.22} \approx 0.7993

2. Compute \(\sigma\):
   \[
   \sigma = 54,000 \times 0.7993 \approx 43,159.2 \, \text{lb/in}^2
   \]

### Part (b): Determine the true strain when the flow stress \(\sigma = 40,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2\).

Rearrange the flow curve equation to solve for \(\epsilon\):

\[
40,000 = 54,000 \times \epsilon^{0.22}
\]

\[
\epsilon^{0.22} = \frac{40,000}{54,000} \approx 0.74074
\]

To solve for \(\epsilon\), raise both sides to the power of \(\frac{1}{0.22}\):

\[
\epsilon = (0.74074)^{\frac{1}{0.22}}
\]

Compute:

1. \((0.74074)^{\frac{1}{0.22}} \approx 0.3713
\]

### Final Answers:

(a) The flow stress at a true strain of \(0.45\) is approximately \(43,159.2 \, \text{lb/in}^2\).

(b) The true strain at a flow stress of \(40,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2\) is approximately \(0.3713\).","The typical stress–strain relationship for a metal exhibits elasticity below the  yield point and strain hardening above it. Figures 3.4 and 3.5 indicate this behavior  in linear and logarithmic axes. In the plastic region, the metal’s behavior is expressed  by the ﬂ  ow curve:  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

where $K=$  the strength coefﬁ  cient, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ; and $n$  is the strain hardening expo- nent. The stress  $\sigma$  and strain  $\epsilon$  in the ﬂ  ow curve are true stress and true strain. The  ﬂ  ow curve is generally valid as a relationship that deﬁ  nes a metal’s plastic behavior  in cold working. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for different metals at room temperature  are listed in Table 3.4.  

Flow Stress  The ﬂ  ow curve describes the stress–strain relationship in the region  in which metal forming takes place. It indicates the ﬂ  ow stress of the metal—the  strength property that determines forces and power required to accomplish a par- ticular forming operation. For most metals at room temperature, the stress–strain  plot of Figure 3.5 indicates that as the metal is deformed, its strength increases  due to strain hardening. The stress required to continue deformation must be  increased to match this increase in strength.  Flow stress  is deﬁ  ned as the instan- taneous value of stress required to continue deforming the material—to keep the  metal “ﬂ  owing.” It is the yield strength of the metal as a function of strain, which  can be expressed:  

$$
Y_{f}=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

where  $Y_{f}=$  ﬂ  ow stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ .  

In the individual forming operations discussed in the following two chapters, the  instantaneous ﬂ  ow stress can be used to analyze the process as it is occurring. For  example, in certain forging operations, the instantaneous force during compression  can be determined from the ﬂ  ow stress value. Maximum force can be calculated  based on the ﬂ  ow stress that results from the ﬁ  nal strain at the end of the forging  stroke.  

In other cases, the analysis is based on the average stresses and strains that occur  during deformation rather than instantaneous values. Extrusion represents this case,  Figure 17.2(c). As the billet is reduced in cross section to pass through the extrusion  die opening, the metal gradually strain hardens to reach a maximum value. Rather  than determine a sequence of instantaneous stress–strain values during the reduc- tion, which would be not only difﬁ  cult but also of limited interest, it is more useful to  analyze the process based on the average ﬂ  ow stress during deformation.  

Average Flow Stress  The average ﬂ  ow stress (also called the  mean ﬂ  ow stress ) is  the average value of stress over the stress–strain curve from the beginning of strain  to the ﬁ  nal (maximum) value that occurs during deformation. The value is illustrated  in the stress–strain plot of Figure 17.4. The average ﬂ  ow stress is determined by inte- grating the ﬂ  ow curve equation, Equation (17.1), between zero and the ﬁ  nal strain  value deﬁ  ning the range of interest. This yields the equation:  

$$
\overline{{Y}}_{f}=\frac{K\epsilon^{n}}{1+n}
$$

where   $\overline{{Y}}_{f}\,=$  average ﬂ  ow stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ; and  $\epsilon=$ maximum strain value during  the deformation process. Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.

FIGURE 3.5  True stress–strain  curve plotted on log–log scale.  

Because it is a straight line in this transformation of the data, the relationship  between true stress and true strain in the plastic region can be expressed as  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

This equation is called the  ﬂ  ow curve , and it provides a good approximation of the  behavior of metals in the plastic region, including their capacity for strain hardening.  The constant $K$  is called the  strength coefﬁ  cient , MPa  $(1{\mathrm{b}}/{\mathrm{in}}^{2}),$  and it equals the value  of true stress at a true strain value equal to one. The parameter  $n$  is called the  strain  hardening exponent , and it is the slope of the line in Figure 3.5. Its value is directly  related to a metal’s tendency to work harden. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for selected  metals are given in Table 3.4.

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine the strength coefﬁ  cient and  strain hardening exponent in the ﬂ  ow curve equation: $\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}$ .  

Solution:  We have two points on the ﬂ  ow curve from which the ﬂ  ow curve  parameters can be determined: (1) at the yield point and (2) at the maximum  load.  

(1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ . (1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ .  

Solving for $n$  and $K$ ,  

(1) $K=160/(0.001998)^{n}$  and (2) $K=375/(0.143)^{n}$   $160/(0.001998)^{n}=375/(0.143)^{n}$  

 $\ln(160)-n\ln(0.001998)=\ln(375)-n\ln(0.143$  ln(0.143)

 $5.0752-(-6.2156)n=5.9269-(-1.9449)n

$ $5.0752+6.2156n=5.9269+1.9449n

$ $(6.2156-1.9449)n=5.9269-5.0752

$ $4.2707n=0.8517$        $n=0.1994$ Substituting back into (1): $K=160/(0.001998)^{0.1994}=552.7$ .  

Check:  Using (2):  $K=375/(0.143)^{0.1994}=552.7.$  

The ﬂ  ow curve equation is $\sigma={\tt552.7}\epsilon^{\tt0.1994}$ .  

Necking in a tensile test and in metal forming operations that stretch the work  part is closely related to strain hardening. As the test specimen is elongated during  the initial part of the test (before necking begins), uniform straining occurs through- out the length because if any element in the specimen becomes strained more than  the surrounding metal, its strength increases by work hardening, thus making it  more resistant to additional strain until the surrounding metal has been strained  an equal amount. Finally, the strain becomes so large that uniform straining cannot  be sustained. A weak point in the length develops (from buildup of dislocations at  grain boundaries, impurities in the metal, or other factors), and necking is initiated,  leading to failure. Empirical evidence reveals that necking begins for a particular  metal when the true strain reaches a value equal to the strain-hardening exponent $n$ .  Therefore, a higher $n$  value means that the metal can be strained further before the  onset of necking during tensile loading.  

Types of Stress–Strain Relationships  Much information about elastic–plastic  behavior is provided by the true stress–strain curve. As indicated, Hooke’s law  ( $\mathit{(\sigma=E\epsilon)}$ ) governs the metal’s behavior in the elastic region, and the ﬂ  ow curve

(b) To be compressed to the same true strain value (e = -0.693) the final height of the compression specimen can be determined as follows: H = -.693 = ln(Lf/Lo) Lf/Lo = exp.(-0.693) = 0.500 Therefore, Lf = 0.5 Lo","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the engineering strain and true strain first, and then consider the scenario for compression:

### Tension

**1. Engineering Strain Calculation:**

The engineering strain (\( \varepsilon \)) is calculated as:

\[ \varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0} \]

where \( \Delta L \) is the change in length and \( L_0 \) is the original length of the specimen.

- Given that the specimen is elongated to twice its original length:

\[ L_f = 2L_0 \]

The change in length (\( \Delta L \)) is:

\[ \Delta L = L_f - L_0 = 2L_0 - L_0 = L_0 \]

So the engineering strain becomes:

\[ \varepsilon = \frac{L_0}{L_0} = 1 \]

**2. True Strain Calculation:**

The true strain (\( \varepsilon_t \)) is calculated using the natural logarithm of the ratio of final length to original length:

\[ \varepsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{L_f}{L_0}\right) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \varepsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{2L_0}{L_0}\right) = \ln(2) \]

Using the natural logarithm:

\[ \varepsilon_t \approx 0.693 \]

### Compression

**(a) Engineering Strain for Compression:**

For the engineering strain in compression to equal -1 (the same magnitude but opposite sign as tension), the final compressed length (\( L_{fc} \)) would be:

\[ \varepsilon = \frac{L_{fc} - L_0}{L_0} = -1 \]

Solving for \( L_{fc} \):

\[ L_{fc} - L_0 = -L_0 \]

\[ L_{fc} = L_0 - L_0 = 0 \]

This indicates that the specimen would need to be compressed to zero length, which is impossible. Therefore, this scenario is physically unrealistic, highlighting why engineering strain is not ideal for large deformations.

**(b) True Strain for Compression:**

For the true strain in compression to equal the negative of the true strain in tension (-0.693):

The relationship for true strain in compression is similar to that in tension:

\[ \varepsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{L_{fc}}{L_0}\right) = -0.693 \]

Solving for \( L_{fc} \):

\[ \ln\left(\frac{L_{fc}}{L_0}\right) = -0.693 \]

Exponentiating both sides gives:

\[ \frac{L_{fc}}{L_0} = e^{-0.693} \]

\[ L_{fc} = L_0 \cdot e^{-0.693} \]

\[ L_{fc} = L_0 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \]

\[ L_{fc} = \frac{L_0}{2} \]

### Final Answer:

1. Engineering strain in tension = 1
2. True strain in tension = 0.693
3. Engineering strain for compression = impossible scenario (zero length)
4. True strain for compression = final compressed length = \( \frac{L_0}{2} \)",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.12
"Derive an expression for true strain as a function of D and Do for a tensile test specimen of round cross section, where D = the instantaneous diameter of the specimen and Do is its original diameter.","Solution: Starting with the definition of true strain as H = ln(L/Lo) and assuming constant volume, we have V = AoLo = AL Therefore, L/Lo = Ao/A       A =pi D^2 and Ao =pi Do^2 and A0=piD^2        Ao/A = piDo^2/piD^2 = (Do/D)2 H = ln(Do/D)2 = 2ln(Do/D)","To derive the expression for true strain \(\epsilon_t\) as a function of the instantaneous diameter \(D\) and the original diameter \(D_o\) for a tensile test specimen of round cross-section, we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the True Strain Formula
True strain (\(\epsilon_t\)) is calculated using the natural logarithm of the ratio of the final length to the initial length:

\[
\epsilon_t = \ln{\frac{L}{L_o}}
\]

### Step 2: Relate Length and Diameter
In a tensile test, volume is conserved up to the point of necking, so the initial and final volumes of the cylindrical specimen are equal. The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by:

\[
V = A \cdot L
\]

where \(A\) is the cross-sectional area. For a cylindrical specimen:

\[
A = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}
\]

Thus, the initial and final volumes are:

\[
V_o = \frac{\pi D_o^2}{4} \cdot L_o
\]

\[
V = \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \cdot L
\]

### Step 3: Set Volumes Equal (Volume Conservation)

\[
\frac{\pi D_o^2}{4} \cdot L_o = \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \cdot L
\]

Simplifying this, we find:

\[
D_o^2 \cdot L_o = D^2 \cdot L
\]

Thus:

\[
L = \frac{D_o^2 \cdot L_o}{D^2}
\]

### Step 4: Substitute into True Strain Formula

Substitute \(L = \frac{D_o^2 \cdot L_o}{D^2}\) into the true strain formula:

\[
\epsilon_t = \ln{\frac{\frac{D_o^2 \cdot L_o}{D^2}}{L_o}}
\]

\[
\epsilon_t = \ln{\left(\frac{D_o^2}{D^2}\right)}
\]

\[
\epsilon_t = \ln{\left(\frac{D_o}{D}\right)^2}
\]

\[
\epsilon_t = 2 \ln{\left(\frac{D_o}{D}\right)}
\]

### Final Answer
The expression for true strain \(\epsilon_t\) in terms of the instantaneous diameter \(D\) and the original diameter \(D_o\) is:

\[
\epsilon_t = 2 \ln{\left(\frac{D_o}{D}\right)}
\]","To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

metallic test specimens and the associated nonuniform effect on elongation and area  reduction. Despite these difﬁ  culties, percent elongation and percent area reduction  are the most commonly used measures of ductility in engineering practice.

# Example 3.1  Engineering  stress and strain  

A tensile test specimen has a starting gage length $=50\:\mathrm{mm}$  and a cross-sectional  area $=200\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ . During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ .

FIGURE 3.2  Typical  progress of a tensile  test: (1) beginning of  test, no load; (2) uniform  elongation and reduc- tion of cross-sectional  area; (3) continued  elongation, maximum  load reached; (4) neck- ing begins, load begins  to decrease; and (5)  fracture. If pieces are  put back together as in  (6), ﬁ  nal length can be  measured.  

The load and the change in length of the specimen are recorded as testing proceeds,  to provide the data required to determine the stress–strain relationship. There are  two different types of stress–strain curves: (1) engineering stress–strain and (2) true  stress–strain. The ﬁ  rst is more important in design, and the second is more important  in manufacturing.  

Engineering Stress–strain   The engineering stress and strain in a tensile test are  deﬁ  ned relative to the original area and length of the test specimen. These values are  of interest in design because the designer expects that the strains experienced by any  component of the product will not signiﬁ  cantly change its shape. The components  are designed to withstand the anticipated stresses encountered in service.  

A typical engineering stress–strain curve from a tensile test of a metallic speci- men is illustrated in Figure 3.3. The  engineering stress  at any point on the curve is  deﬁ  ned as the force divided by the original area:  

$$
s=\frac{F}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $s=$  engineering stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ );  $F=$  applied force in the test, $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A_{o}=$  original area of the test specimen,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}$   $(\mathrm{in}^{2}]$ ). The  engineering strain  at any  point in the test is given by  

$$
e=\frac{L-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $e\:=\:$  engineering strain,  $\mathrm{mm/mm~(in/in)}$ ;  $L=$ length at any point during the  elongation, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and $L_{o}=$  original gage length, mm (in). The units of engineer- ing strain are given as $\mathrm{mm/mm}$  (in/in), but think of it as representing elongation per  unit length, without units.  

The stress–strain relationship in Figure 3.3 has two regions, indicating two dis- tinct forms of behavior: (1) elastic and (2) plastic. In the elastic region, the relation- ship between stress and strain is linear, and the material exhibits elastic behavior by  

![](images/d0bec5dc14bfbf80832d78675a36196cfd2800b33ec74d7a6c30553b276140c2.jpg)  

returning to its original length when the load (stress) is released. The relationship is  deﬁ  ned by  Hooke’s law :  

$$
s=E e
$$  

where  $E=$   modulus of elasticity  (also known as  Young’s modulus ), MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ,  a measure of the inherent stiffness of a material. It is a constant of proportionality  whose value is different for different materials. Table 3.1 presents typical values for  several materials, metals and nonmetals.  

As stress increases, some point in the linear relationship is ﬁ  nally reached at  which the material begins to yield. This  yield point   $Y$ of the material can be identi- ﬁ  ed in the ﬁ  gure by the change in slope at the end of the linear region. Because the  start of yielding is usually difﬁ  cult to see in a plot of test data (it does not usually oc- cur as an abrupt change in slope), $Y$  is typically deﬁ  ned as the stress at which a strain  offset of  $0.2\%$  from the straight line has occurred. (1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ .  

Solving for $n$  and $K$ ,  

(1) $K=160/(0.001998)^{n}$  and (2) $K=375/(0.143)^{n}$   $160/(0.001998)^{n}=375/(0.143)^{n}$  

 $\ln(160)-n\ln(0.001998)=\ln(375)-n\ln(0.143$  ln(0.143)

 $5.0752-(-6.2156)n=5.9269-(-1.9449)n

$ $5.0752+6.2156n=5.9269+1.9449n

$ $(6.2156-1.9449)n=5.9269-5.0752

$ $4.2707n=0.8517$        $n=0.1994$ Substituting back into (1): $K=160/(0.001998)^{0.1994}=552.7$ .  

Check:  Using (2):  $K=375/(0.143)^{0.1994}=552.7.$  

The ﬂ  ow curve equation is $\sigma={\tt552.7}\epsilon^{\tt0.1994}$ .  

Necking in a tensile test and in metal forming operations that stretch the work  part is closely related to strain hardening. As the test specimen is elongated during  the initial part of the test (before necking begins), uniform straining occurs through- out the length because if any element in the specimen becomes strained more than  the surrounding metal, its strength increases by work hardening, thus making it  more resistant to additional strain until the surrounding metal has been strained  an equal amount. Finally, the strain becomes so large that uniform straining cannot  be sustained. A weak point in the length develops (from buildup of dislocations at  grain boundaries, impurities in the metal, or other factors), and necking is initiated,  leading to failure. Empirical evidence reveals that necking begins for a particular  metal when the true strain reaches a value equal to the strain-hardening exponent $n$ .  Therefore, a higher $n$  value means that the metal can be strained further before the  onset of necking during tensile loading.  

Types of Stress–Strain Relationships  Much information about elastic–plastic  behavior is provided by the true stress–strain curve. As indicated, Hooke’s law  ( $\mathit{(\sigma=E\epsilon)}$ ) governs the metal’s behavior in the elastic region, and the ﬂ  ow curve

"Show that true strain H = ln(1 + e), where e = engineering strain.","Solution: Starting definitions: (1) H = ln(L/Lo) and (2) e = (L -Lo)/Lo Consider definition (2): e = L/Lo -Lo/Lo = L/Lo -1 Rearranging, 1 + e = L/Lo Substituting this into definition (1), H = ln(1 + e)","To show that true strain \( H = \ln(1 + e) \), where \( e \) is the engineering strain, we need to understand the definitions of both strains.

### Definitions:
1. **Engineering Strain (\( e \))**: 
   \[
   e = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0}
   \]
   where \( L \) is the final length and \( L_0 \) is the original length.

2. **True Strain (\( \epsilon \))**: 
   \[
   \epsilon = \int_{L_0}^{L} \frac{dL}{L} = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right)
   \]

### Derivation:
The relationship between true strain and engineering strain can be derived as follows:

- Start with the definition of engineering strain:
  \[
  e = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0}
  \]

- Rearrange the equation to solve for \( L \):
  \[
  L = L_0(1 + e)
  \]

- Now, substitute this expression for \( L \) into the equation for true strain:
  \[
  \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{L_0(1 + e)}{L_0}\right)
  \]

- Simplify the right side:
  \[
  \epsilon = \ln(1 + e)
  \]

Thus, we have shown that true strain \( \epsilon = \ln(1 + e) \), confirming the relationship between true strain and engineering strain.

### Final Answer:
\[ H = \ln(1 + e) \]

This derivation uses the standard definitions and demonstrates the transformation from engineering strain to true strain.","In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the

previous curve, a downturn ﬁ  nally occurs as a result of necking. A dashed line is used  in the ﬁ  gure to indicate the projected continuation of the true stress–strain plot if  necking had not occurred.  

As strain becomes signiﬁ  cant in the plastic region, the values of true strain and  engineering strain diverge. True strain can be related to the corresponding engineer- ing strain by  

$$
\epsilon=\ln(1+e)
$$  

Similarly, true stress and engineering stress can be related by the expression  

$$
\sigma=s\,(1\,+\,e)
$$  

In Figure 3.4, note that stress increases continuously in the plastic region until  necking begins. When this happened in the engineering stress–strain curve, its sig- niﬁ  cance was lost because an admittedly erroneous area value was used to calculate  stress. Now when the true stress also increases, it cannot be dismissed so lightly.  What it means is that the metal is becoming stronger as strain increases. This is the  property called  strain hardening  that was mentioned in the previous chapter in the  discussion of metallic crystal structures, and it is a property that most metals exhibit  to a greater or lesser degree.  

# Example 3.2  True stress and  strain  

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine (a) true stress and (b) true strain  at the maximum load of  $65{,}000\:\mathrm{N}.$ .  

Solution:  (a) True stress is deﬁ  ned as the load divided by the instantaneous  area. To ﬁ  nd the instantaneous area, we assume uniform elongation prior to  necking. Thus, $A L=A_{o}L_{o}$ , and $A=A_{o}L_{o}/L=200(50)/57.7=173.3\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}/$  

$$
{\sigma=F/A=65,\!000/173.3=375\;\mathrm{MPa}}
$$  

(b) By Equation (3.7), true strain $\epsilon=\ln(L/L_{o})=\ln(57.7/50)=$ $\ln(1.154)={\bf0.143}$ .  

Check:  Use Equations (3.8) and (3.9) to check these values:  

Using Equation (3.8) and the value of  $e$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\epsilon=\ln(1+0.154)=0.143$ .  

Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.

This equation is called the  ﬂ  ow curve , and it provides a good approximation of the  behavior of metals in the plastic region, including their capacity for strain hardening.

However, it should be noted that these values are associated with the necked portion of the test specimen.","To determine the true stress and true strain at the point of failure for a copper wire with a diameter of 0.80 mm (engineered stress = 248.2 MPa), let's go through the calculations step by step.

### Given Data:
- Diameter of the wire = 0.80 mm
- Engineering stress (σ_e) = 248.2 MPa
- Ductility = 75% reduction of area

### Step-by-Step Calculations:

#### 1. Calculate the Original Cross-Sectional Area (A0)
The original area is calculated from the diameter:
\[
A_0 = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \left(\frac{0.80}{2}\right)^2 = 0.50265 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

#### 2. Calculate the Final Cross-Sectional Area (Af)
Reduction of area is 75%, so:
\[
A_f = A_0 (1 - \text{Reduction of Area}) = 0.50265 \times 0.25 = 0.1257 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

#### 3. Calculate the True Stress (σ_t)
True stress is calculated using the actual final area:
\[
\sigma_t = \frac{\text{Applied Force}}{A_f}
\]
The applied force can be found by rearranging the engineering stress formula:
\[
F = \sigma_e \times A_0 = 248.2 \times 0.50265 = 124.73 \, \text{N}
\]
Now, calculate true stress:
\[
\sigma_t = \frac{124.73}{0.1257} = 992.59 \, \text{MPa}
\]

#### 4. Calculate the True Strain (ε_t)
True strain is given by:
\[
\epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{A_0}{A_f}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{0.50265}{0.1257}\right) = 1.386
\]

### Final Answer:
- **True Stress at failure**: \( \sigma_t = 992.59 \, \text{MPa} \)
- **True Strain at failure**: \( \epsilon_t = 1.386 \)

These values represent the stress and strain in the material at the point of failure, considering the actual reduction in cross-sectional area and the corresponding logarithmic strain.","During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}.

$ (b) Subtracting the $0.2\%$  offset, engineering strain  $e=(50.2-50.0)/50.0\;-

$ $0.002=0.002$ Rearranging Equation (3.3), modulus of elasticity  $E=s/e=160/0.002=$  

 $\mathbf{80,000\,M P a}$ .

 (c) Tensile strength $=$  maximum load divided by original area: 

 ${\cal T}S=65{,}000/200=325~\mathrm{M}\mathrm{Pa}$ .

 (d) By Equation (3.2), engineering strain at maximum load  $e=$  

 $(57.7-50)/50={\bf0.154}$ .

 (e) Deﬁ  ned in Equation (3.4), percent elongation $E L=(59.5-50)/50=$  

 $\mathbf{0.19}=\mathbf{19\%}$ .  

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the  

! To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}. (1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ .  

Solving for $n$  and $K$ ,  

(1) $K=160/(0.001998)^{n}$  and (2) $K=375/(0.143)^{n}$   $160/(0.001998)^{n}=375/(0.143)^{n}$  

 $\ln(160)-n\ln(0.001998)=\ln(375)-n\ln(0.143$  ln(0.143)

 $5.0752-(-6.2156)n=5.9269-(-1.9449)n

$ $5.0752+6.2156n=5.9269+1.9449n

$ $(6.2156-1.9449)n=5.9269-5.0752

$ $4.2707n=0.8517$        $n=0.1994$ Substituting back into (1): $K=160/(0.001998)^{0.1994}=552.7$ .  

Check:  Using (2):  $K=375/(0.143)^{0.1994}=552.7.$  

The ﬂ  ow curve equation is $\sigma={\tt552.7}\epsilon^{\tt0.1994}$ .  

Necking in a tensile test and in metal forming operations that stretch the work  part is closely related to strain hardening. As the test specimen is elongated during  the initial part of the test (before necking begins), uniform straining occurs through- out the length because if any element in the specimen becomes strained more than  the surrounding metal, its strength increases by work hardening, thus making it  more resistant to additional strain until the surrounding metal has been strained  an equal amount. Finally, the strain becomes so large that uniform straining cannot  be sustained. A weak point in the length develops (from buildup of dislocations at  grain boundaries, impurities in the metal, or other factors), and necking is initiated,  leading to failure. Empirical evidence reveals that necking begins for a particular  metal when the true strain reaches a value equal to the strain-hardening exponent $n$ .  Therefore, a higher $n$  value means that the metal can be strained further before the  onset of necking during tensile loading.  

Types of Stress–Strain Relationships  Much information about elastic–plastic  behavior is provided by the true stress–strain curve. As indicated, Hooke’s law  ( $\mathit{(\sigma=E\epsilon)}$ ) governs the metal’s behavior in the elastic region, and the ﬂ  ow curve

### Given:
- Starting gage length, \( L_0 = 2.0\, \text{in} \)
- Cross-sectional area, \( A_0 = 0.5\, \text{in}^2 \) 
- Maximum load, \( F = 37,000\, \text{lb} \)
- Elongation at maximum load, \( 24\% \)

### (a) Calculate the True Stress

True stress is calculated using the formula:

\[ 
\sigma = \frac{F}{A} 
\]

Since we are dealing with true stress, we need to find the instantaneous area. However, to simplify, we'll begin with the engineering stress and adjust using elongation:

1. **Engineering Stress**:

\[ 
s = \frac{F}{A_0} = \frac{37,000\, \text{lb}}{0.5\, \text{in}^2} = 74,000\, \text{psi} 
\]

2. **True Stress**:

Using the assumption of volume constancy before and after elongation (common approximation):

\[ 
A \times L = A_0 \times L_0 
\]

Given the 24% elongation, final length \( L = 1.24 \times L_0 \).

Substitute the new gage length ratio:

\[
A = \frac{A_0 \times L_0}{L} = \frac{A_0}{1.24}
\]

True stress:

\[ 
\sigma = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{F}{A_0/1.24} = s \times 1.24 = 74,000 \times 1.24 = 91,760\, \text{psi} 
\]

### (b) Calculate the True Strain

True strain is defined by:

\[
\epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right) = \ln(1.24) 
\]

Calculate:

\[
\epsilon = \ln(1.24) \approx 0.215 
\]

### Final Answers:
- **True Stress**: \( 91,760\, \text{psi} \)
- **True Strain**: \( 0.215 \)","During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ .

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the  

! To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

If pieces are  put back together as in  (6), ﬁ  nal length can be  measured.  

The load and the change in length of the specimen are recorded as testing proceeds,  to provide the data required to determine the stress–strain relationship. There are  two different types of stress–strain curves: (1) engineering stress–strain and (2) true  stress–strain. The ﬁ  rst is more important in design, and the second is more important  in manufacturing.  

Engineering Stress–strain   The engineering stress and strain in a tensile test are  deﬁ  ned relative to the original area and length of the test specimen. These values are  of interest in design because the designer expects that the strains experienced by any  component of the product will not signiﬁ  cantly change its shape. The components  are designed to withstand the anticipated stresses encountered in service.  

A typical engineering stress–strain curve from a tensile test of a metallic speci- men is illustrated in Figure 3.3. The  engineering stress  at any point on the curve is  deﬁ  ned as the force divided by the original area:  

$$
s=\frac{F}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $s=$  engineering stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ );  $F=$  applied force in the test, $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A_{o}=$  original area of the test specimen,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}$   $(\mathrm{in}^{2}]$ ). The  engineering strain  at any  point in the test is given by  

$$
e=\frac{L-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $e\:=\:$  engineering strain,  $\mathrm{mm/mm~(in/in)}$ ;  $L=$ length at any point during the  elongation, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and $L_{o}=$  original gage length, mm (in). The units of engineer- ing strain are given as $\mathrm{mm/mm}$  (in/in), but think of it as representing elongation per  unit length, without units.  

The stress–strain relationship in Figure 3.3 has two regions, indicating two dis- tinct forms of behavior: (1) elastic and (2) plastic. In the elastic region, the relation- ship between stress and strain is linear, and the material exhibits elastic behavior by  

![](images/d0bec5dc14bfbf80832d78675a36196cfd2800b33ec74d7a6c30553b276140c2.jpg)  

returning to its original length when the load (stress) is released. The relationship is  deﬁ  ned by  Hooke’s law :  

$$
s=E e
$$  

where  $E=$   modulus of elasticity  (also known as  Young’s modulus ), MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ,  a measure of the inherent stiffness of a material. It is a constant of proportionality  whose value is different for different materials. Table 3.1 presents typical values for  several materials, metals and nonmetals.  

As stress increases, some point in the linear relationship is ﬁ  nally reached at  which the material begins to yield. This  yield point   $Y$ of the material can be identi- ﬁ  ed in the ﬁ  gure by the change in slope at the end of the linear region. Because the  start of yielding is usually difﬁ  cult to see in a plot of test data (it does not usually oc- cur as an abrupt change in slope), $Y$  is typically deﬁ  ned as the stress at which a strain  offset of  $0.2\%$  from the straight line has occurred.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt","0.908473568374828, 0.8991271190616001, 0.8937216967286703",3.0,3.17

We will use the flow curve equation and apply the appropriate transformations to calculate the necessary load. Here are the detailed steps:

### Flow Curve Equation
The flow curve represents the stress-strain relationship during plastic deformation and is given by:

\[
\sigma = K \cdot \epsilon^n
\]

where:
- \( \sigma \) is the true stress,
- \( \epsilon \) is the true strain,
- \( K = 620.5 \ \text{MPa} \) is the strength coefficient,
- \( n = 0.26 \) is the strain-hardening exponent.

### True Strain Calculation
First, we calculate the true strain for the change in specimen height from 62.5 mm to 50 mm.

True strain (\( \epsilon \)) during compression is given by:

\[
\epsilon = \ln \left(\frac{h_0}{h}\right)
\]

where:
- \( h_0 = 62.5 \ \text{mm} \) is the original height,
- \( h = 50 \ \text{mm} \) is the final height.

Calculating \(\epsilon\):

\[
\epsilon = \ln \left(\frac{62.5}{50}\right) = \ln(1.25) \approx 0.2231
\]

### True Stress Calculation
Using the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = K \cdot \epsilon^n = 620.5 \cdot (0.2231)^{0.26}
\]

Calculating \(\sigma\):

1. Calculate \( (0.2231)^{0.26} \):
   
   \[
   (0.2231)^{0.26} \approx 0.6109
   \]

2. Calculate \(\sigma\):

   \[
   \sigma = 620.5 \cdot 0.6109 \approx 378.8 \ \text{MPa}
   \]

### Cross-sectional Area Calculation
As the height decreases, the cross-sectional area \( A \) increases (assuming volume constancy). Initial volume (\( V_0 \)) is:

\[
V_0 = A_0 \cdot h_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \cdot d^2 \cdot h_0
\]

where \( d = 25 \ \text{mm} \).

Calculate \( A_0 \):

\[
A_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \cdot 25^2 = 490.87 \ \text{mm}^2
\]

Initial volume:

\[
V_0 = 490.87 \cdot 62.5 = 30679.38 \ \text{mm}^3
\]

Volume constancy implies:

\[
V_0 = A \cdot h
\]

So new area \( A \):

\[
A = \frac{30679.38}{50} = 613.5876 \ \text{mm}^2
\]

Convert to square meters for stress units (1 \(\text{mm}^2 = 1 \times 10^{-6} \ \text{m}^2\)):

\[
A = 613.5876 \times 10^{-6} \ \text{m}^2
\]

### Calculate Load
Finally, calculate the load \( F \) using \( \sigma = \frac{F}{A} \):

\[
F = \sigma \cdot A = 378.8 \times 10^6 \cdot 613.5876 \times 10^{-6}
\]

\[
F = 378.8 \cdot 613.5876 \approx 232401.18 \ \text{N}
\]

\[
\sigma = K \cdot \epsilon^n
\]

where:
- \(\sigma\) is the true stress,
- \(K\) is the strength coefficient (620.5 MPa in this case),
- \(\epsilon\) is the true strain,
- \(n\) is the strain-hardening exponent (0.26 in this case).

Since we're dealing with a compression test, we'll calculate the true strain based on changes in height. The true strain \(\epsilon\) in a compression test is given by:

\[
\epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{h_0}{h_f}\right)
\]

where:
- \(h_0\) is the initial height (62.5 mm),
- \(h_f\) is the final height (37.5 mm).

Now, calculate the true strain:

\[
\epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{62.5}{37.5}\right) = \ln(1.6667) \approx 0.5108
\]

Next, we can calculate the true stress using the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = 620.5 \times (0.5108)^{0.26}
\]

We first calculate \(0.5108^{0.26}\):

\[
0.5108^{0.26} \approx 0.795
\]

Then we calculate the true stress:

\[
\sigma = 620.5 \times 0.795 \approx 493.3 \, \text{MPa}
\]

To determine the load required, we also need to know the area of the compressed specimen. Since the volume remains constant during deformation, we can use the initial and final dimensions to calculate the final area, \(A_f\).

1. The initial volume \(V_0\) is:

\[
V_0 = \text{initial height} \times \text{cross-sectional area}
\]

The initial cross-sectional area \(A_0\) is:

\[
A_0 = \pi \times \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \times \left(\frac{25}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \times 12.5^2 \approx 490.87 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

So, the initial volume \(V_0\) is:

\[
V_0 = 62.5 \times 490.87 \approx 30679.375 \, \text{mm}^3
\]

2. The final volume \(V_f\) remains the same as \(V_0\), and the final height \(h_f\) is given as 37.5 mm.

\[
A_f = \frac{V_0}{h_f} = \frac{30679.375}{37.5} \approx 817.45 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

3. Finally, the load \(F\) required to compress the specimen is:

\[
F = \sigma \times A_f
\]

So,

\[
F = 493.3 \times 817.45 \approx 403348 \, \text{N} \approx 403.35 \, \text{kN}

Ao = Do/4 = (1.5)^2/4 = 1.767 in2 Y = 140,000/1.767 = 79,224 lb/in2","To solve this problem, we need to determine the yield strength of the steel test specimen. Yield strength is the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically. Beyond the yield point, the material will deform permanently, and it will not return to its original shape when the load is removed. A common way to approximate the yield strength is the 0.2% offset method, where a line parallel to the elastic (linear) portion of the stress-strain curve is drawn at a strain of 0.002 (or 0.2%).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

**Step 1: Calculate the original cross-sectional area of the specimen.**

The initial diameter of the specimen is given as 1.5 inches. The formula for the cross-sectional area \(A\) of a circle is:

\[ A = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 \]

where \(d\) is the diameter.

Plugging in the given diameter:

\[ A = \pi \left(\frac{1.5}{2}\right)^2 = \pi (0.75)^2 \]
\[ A \approx 3.14 \times 0.5625 = 1.767 \, \text{in}^2 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the yield strength of the material.**

Yield strength (\(\sigma_y\)) is defined as the load at which yielding begins (using the 0.2% offset load) divided by the original cross-sectional area. 

Given:

- The load at yielding (\(F_y\)) = 140,000 lb

\[ \sigma_y = \frac{F_y}{A} = \frac{140,000 \, \text{lb}}{1.767 \, \text{in}^2} \]

\[ \sigma_y \approx 79,244 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \]

**Step 3: Confirm using modulus of elasticity (Optional, not needed here but for understanding material behavior)**

- Modulus of elasticity (\(E\)) = 30 x \(10^6\) lb/in²

Since there was not a request for additional load calculations and since the 0.2% offset method focuses primarily on identifying the yield point, the above steps satisfactorily answer the specified portion of the problem regarding yield strength.

(a) Yield Strength = 79,244 lb/in²",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.2

If the transverse rupture strength of the material is known to be 1000 MPa, what is the anticipated load at which the specimen is likely to fail, given that its width = 15 mm, thickness = 10 mm, and length = 60 mm?","Solution: F = (TRS)(bt^2)/1.5L = 1000(15 x 10^2)/(1.5 x 60) = 16,667 N.","To calculate the anticipated load \( F \) at which the specimen is likely to fail, we can use the formula for transverse rupture strength (TRS) given by:

\[
TRS = \frac{1.5FL}{bt^2}

where:
- \( TRS = 1000 \, \text{MPa} \)
- \( L = 60 \, \text{mm} \)
- \( b = 15 \, \text{mm} \)
- \( t = 10 \, \text{mm} \)

\[
F = \frac{TRS \cdot bt^2}{1.5L}

Substitute in the given values:

\[
F = \frac{1000 \times 15 \times 10^2}{1.5 \times 60}

Calculate \( F \):

\[
F = \frac{1000 \times 15 \times 100}{90}

\[

load. These materials do not respond well to traditional tensile testing because of  problems in preparing the test specimens and possible misalignment of the press  jaws that hold the specimen. The  bending test  (also known as the  ﬂ  exure test ) is  used to test the strength of these materials, using a setup illustrated in the ﬁ  rst  diagram in Figure 3.10. In this procedure, a specimen of rectangular cross section  is positioned between two supports, and a load is applied at its center. In this con- ﬁ  guration, the test is called a three-point bending test. A four-point conﬁ  guration  is also sometimes used. These brittle materials do not ﬂ  ex to the exaggerated ex- tent shown in Figure 3.10; instead they deform elastically until immediately be- fore fracture. Failure usually occurs because the ultimate tensile strength of the  outer ﬁ  bers of the specimen has been exceeded. This results in  cleavage , a failure  mode associated with ceramics and metals operating at low service temperatures,  in which separation rather than slip occurs along certain crystallographic planes.  The strength value derived from this test is called the  transverse rupture strength ,  calculated from the formula  

$$
T R S={\frac{1.5F L}{b t^{2}}}
$$  

where  $T R S=$  transverse rupture strength, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  applied load at fracture,  N (lb); $L=$ length of the specimen between supports, mm (in); and  $b$  and  $t$  are the  dimensions of the cross section of the specimen as shown in the ﬁ  gure, mm (in).  

The ﬂ  exure test is also used for certain nonbrittle materials such as thermoplastic  polymers. In this case, because the material is likely to deform rather than fracture,  TRS cannot be determined based on failure of the specimen. Instead, either of two  measures is used: (1) the load recorded at a given level of deﬂ  ection, or (2) the de- ﬂ  ection observed at a given load.  

# 3.1.4 SHEAR PROPERTIES  

Shear involves application of stresses in opposite directions on either side of a thin  element to deﬂ  ect it as shown in Figure 3.11. The shear stress is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\tau={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

![](images/54903b7bc86140704dc9a1b301a1623b6698845dbec06069b59ac3b86084a573.jpg)  

where  $\tau=$  shear stress,  $\mathrm{lb/in^{2}}$  (MPa);  $F=$  applied force,  $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A=$  area over  which the force is applied, $\mathrm{in}^{2}\left(\mathrm{mm}^{2}\right)$ . Shear strain can be deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\gamma=\frac{\delta}{b}
$$  

where  $\gamma=$  shear strain, $\mathrm{mm/mm}\;(\mathrm{in/in});\delta=$ the deﬂ  ection of the element, mm (in);  and $b=$  the orthogonal distance over which deﬂ  ection occurs, mm (in).  

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12. As torque  is increased, the tube deﬂ  ects by twisting, which is a shear strain for this geometry. To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation.

A special ceramic specimen is tested in a bend test. Its width = 0.50 in and thickness = 0.25 in. The length of the specimen between supports = 2.0 in. Determine the transverse rupture strength if failure occurs at a load = 1700 lb.,"Solution: TRS = 1.5FL/bt^2 = 1.5(1700)(2.0)/(0.5 x 0.25^2) = 163,200 lb/in2.","To find the transverse rupture strength (TRS) for the ceramic specimen, we use the formula:

\[
TRS = \frac{1.5 \cdot F \cdot L}{b \cdot t^2}
\]

Where:
- \( F \) is the applied load at fracture = 1700 lb
- \( L \) is the length of the specimen between supports = 2.0 in
- \( b \) is the width of the specimen = 0.50 in
- \( t \) is the thickness of the specimen = 0.25 in

Step-by-step calculation:

1. Calculate \( t^2 \):
   \[
   t^2 = (0.25 \, \text{in})^2 = 0.0625 \, \text{in}^2
   \]

2. Plug the values into the TRS formula:
   \[
   TRS = \frac{1.5 \cdot 1700 \cdot 2.0}{0.50 \cdot 0.0625}
   \]

3. Perform the multiplication in the numerator:
   \[
   1.5 \cdot 1700 \cdot 2.0 = 5100
   \]

4. Perform the multiplication in the denominator:
   \[
   0.50 \cdot 0.0625 = 0.03125

5. Calculate the TRS:
   \[
   TRS = \frac{5100}{0.03125} = 163,200 \, \text{lb/in}^2

"A torsion test specimen has a radius = 25 mm, wall thickness = 3 mm, and gage length = 50 mm. In testing, a torque of 900 N-m results in an angular deflection = 0.3.

(b) J = RD/L, D = 0.3(2pi/360) = 0.005236 radians  J = 25(0.005236)/50 = 0.002618 ","To solve the problem, we need to determine the shear stress and shear strain for the given torsion test specimen.

### Given:
- Radius \( R = 25 \) mm
- Wall thickness \( t = 3 \) mm
- Gauge length \( L = 50 \) mm
- Torque \( T = 900 \) N-m
- Angular deflection \( \alpha = 0.3 \) radians

### (a) Shear Stress (\(\tau\))

The formula for shear stress in a thin-walled tube subject to torsion is:

\[
\tau = \frac{T}{2 \pi R^2 t}
\]

**Substitute the given values**:

- Convert torque to N-mm: \( T = 900 \times 1000 = 900,000 \) N-mm
- Radius \( R = 25 \) mm
- Wall thickness \( t = 3 \) mm

\[
\tau = \frac{900,000}{2 \pi (25)^2 (3)}
\]

Calculate:

\[
\tau = \frac{900,000}{2 \pi \times 625 \times 3}
\]

\[
\tau = \frac{900,000}{3,750 \pi}
\]

\[
\tau \approx \frac{900,000}{11,780.97}
\]

\[
\tau \approx 76.41 \, \text{MPa}
\]

### (b) Shear Strain (\(\gamma\))

The formula for shear strain in torsion is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{R \alpha}{L}
\]

**Substitute the given values**:

- Radius \( R = 25 \) mm
- Angular deflection \( \alpha = 0.3 \) radians
- Gauge length \( L = 50 \) mm

\[
\gamma = \frac{25 \times 0.3}{50}
\]

Calculate:

\[
\gamma = \frac{7.5}{50}
\]

\[
\gamma = 0.15 \, \text{mm/mm}
\]

### Final Answers:
- **Shear Stress (\(\tau\))**: \( 76.41 \, \text{MPa} \)
- **Shear Strain (\(\gamma\))**: \( 0.15 \, \text{mm/mm} \)","Shear strain can be deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\gamma=\frac{\delta}{b}
$$  

where  $\gamma=$  shear strain, $\mathrm{mm/mm}\;(\mathrm{in/in});\delta=$ the deﬂ  ection of the element, mm (in);  and $b=$  the orthogonal distance over which deﬂ  ection occurs, mm (in).  

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12. As torque  is increased, the tube deﬂ  ects by twisting, which is a shear strain for this geometry. The shear stress can be determined in the test by the equation  

$$
\tau=\frac{T}{2\pi R^{2}t}
$$  

where  $T=$  applied torque,  $\mathrm{N{-mm}}$  (lb-in);  $R\,=$ radius of the tube measured to the  neutral axis of the wall, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and $t=$  wall thickness, mm (in). The shear strain can  be determined by measuring the amount of angular deﬂ  ection of the tube, convert- ing this into a distance deﬂ  ected, and dividing by the gauge length  $L$ . Reducing this  to a simple expression,  

$$
\gamma={\frac{R\alpha}{L}}
$$  

where  $\upalpha=$  the angular deﬂ  ection (radians).

where  $G\,=$  the  shear modulus , or  shear modulus of elasticity , MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ . For  most materials, the shear modulus can be approximated by  $G=0.4E$ , where  $E$  is the  conventional elastic modulus.  

In the plastic region of the shear stress–strain curve, the material strain hardens  to cause the applied torque to continue to increase until fracture ﬁ  nally   occurs.  The relationship in this region is similar to the ﬂ  ow curve. The shear stress at  fracture can be calculated and this is used as the  shear strength $S$  of the material.  Shear strength can be estimated from tensile strength data by the approximation:  $S=0.7(T S)$ .  

Because the cross-sectional area of the test specimen in the torsion test does not  change as it does in the tensile and compression tests, the engineering stress–strain  curve for shear derived from the torsion test is virtually the same as the true stress– strain curve.  

Shear processes are common in industry. Shearing action is used to cut sheet metal  in blanking, punching, and other cutting operations (Section 19.1). In machining, the  material is removed by the mechanism of shear deformation (Section 20.2).  

The hardness of a material is deﬁ  ned as its resistance to permanent indentation.  Good hardness generally means that the material is resistant to scratching and wear.  For many engineering applications, including most of the tooling used in manufac- turing, scratch and wear resistance are important characteristics. As the reader shall  see later in this section, there is a strong correlation between hardness and strength.  

3.2.1  HARDNESS TESTS  

Hardness tests are commonly used for assessing material properties because they  are quick and convenient. However, a variety of testing methods are appropriate  because of differences in hardness among different materials. The best-known hard- ness tests are Brinell and Rockwell. During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}.

$ (b) Subtracting the $0.2\%$  offset, engineering strain  $e=(50.2-50.0)/50.0\;-

$ $0.002=0.002$ Rearranging Equation (3.3), modulus of elasticity  $E=s/e=160/0.002=$  

 $\mathbf{80,000\,M P a}$ .

 (c) Tensile strength $=$  maximum load divided by original area: 

 ${\cal T}S=65{,}000/200=325~\mathrm{M}\mathrm{Pa}$ .

 (d) By Equation (3.2), engineering strain at maximum load  $e=$  

 $(57.7-50)/50={\bf0.154}$ .

 (e) Deﬁ  ned in Equation (3.4), percent elongation $E L=(59.5-50)/50=$  

 $\mathbf{0.19}=\mathbf{19\%}$ .  

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation.

load. These materials do not respond well to traditional tensile testing because of  problems in preparing the test specimens and possible misalignment of the press  jaws that hold the specimen. The  bending test  (also known as the  ﬂ  exure test ) is  used to test the strength of these materials, using a setup illustrated in the ﬁ  rst  diagram in Figure 3.10. In this procedure, a specimen of rectangular cross section  is positioned between two supports, and a load is applied at its center. In this con- ﬁ  guration, the test is called a three-point bending test. A four-point conﬁ  guration  is also sometimes used. These brittle materials do not ﬂ  ex to the exaggerated ex- tent shown in Figure 3.10; instead they deform elastically until immediately be- fore fracture. Failure usually occurs because the ultimate tensile strength of the  outer ﬁ  bers of the specimen has been exceeded. This results in  cleavage , a failure  mode associated with ceramics and metals operating at low service temperatures,  in which separation rather than slip occurs along certain crystallographic planes.  The strength value derived from this test is called the  transverse rupture strength ,  calculated from the formula  

$$
T R S={\frac{1.5F L}{b t^{2}}}
$$  

where  $T R S=$  transverse rupture strength, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  applied load at fracture,  N (lb); $L=$ length of the specimen between supports, mm (in); and  $b$  and  $t$  are the  dimensions of the cross section of the specimen as shown in the ﬁ  gure, mm (in).  

The ﬂ  exure test is also used for certain nonbrittle materials such as thermoplastic  polymers. In this case, because the material is likely to deform rather than fracture,  TRS cannot be determined based on failure of the specimen. Instead, either of two  measures is used: (1) the load recorded at a given level of deﬂ  ection, or (2) the de- ﬂ  ection observed at a given load.

$$

where  $\tau=$  shear stress,  $\mathrm{lb/in^{2}}$  (MPa);  $F=$  applied force,  $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A=$  area over  which the force is applied, $\mathrm{in}^{2}\left(\mathrm{mm}^{2}\right)$ . Shear strain can be deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\gamma=\frac{\delta}{b}
$$  

where  $\gamma=$  shear strain, $\mathrm{mm/mm}\;(\mathrm{in/in});\delta=$ the deﬂ  ection of the element, mm (in);  and $b=$  the orthogonal distance over which deﬂ  ection occurs, mm (in).  

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12. As torque  is increased, the tube deﬂ  ects by twisting, which is a shear strain for this geometry. This shear plane area can be calculated as  

$$
A_{s}=\frac{t_{o}w}{\sin\!\phi}
$$  

The shear stress in Equation (20.7) represents the level of stress required to per- form the machining operation. Therefore, this stress is equal to the shear strength of  the work material  $(\tau=S)$ ) under the conditions at which cutting occurs.  

Vector addition of the two force components  $F_{s}$  and  $F_{n}$  yields the resultant force  $R^{\prime}$ . In order for the forces acting on the chip to balance, this resultant  $R^{\prime}$  must be  equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and collinear with the resultant  $R$ .  

None of the four force components  $F,N,F_{s}$ , and $F_{n}$  can be directly measured  in a machining operation, because the directions in which they are applied vary  with different tool geometries and cutting conditions. However, it is possible  for the cutting tool to be instrumented using a force measuring device called a  dynamometer, so that two additional force components acting against the tool  can be directly measured: cutting force and thrust force. The  cutting force   $F_{c}$  is  in the direction of cutting, the same direction as the cutting speed  $\nu$ , and the  thrust force   $F_{t}$  is perpendicular to the cutting force and is associated with the  chip thickness before the cut $t_{o}$ . The cutting force and thrust force are shown in  Figure 20.10(b) together with their resultant force  $R^{\prime\prime}$ . The respective directions  of these forces are known, so the force transducers in the dynamometer can be  aligned accordingly.  

Equations can be derived to relate the four force components that cannot be meas- ured to the two forces that can be measured. Using the force diagram in Figure 20.11,  the following trigonometric relationships can be derived:  

If cutting force and thrust force are known, these four equations can be used to  calculate estimates of shear force, friction force, and normal force to friction. Based  on these force estimates, shear stress and coefﬁ  cient of friction can be determined.  

Note that in the special case of orthogonal cutting when the rake angle  $\alpha\,=\,0$ ,  Equations (20.9) and (20.10) reduce to  $\boldsymbol{F}=\boldsymbol{F}_{\iota}$  and $N=F_{c}$ , respectively. Thus, in this  special case, friction force and its normal force could be directly measured by the  dynamometer.  

# Example 20.2  Shear stress in  machining  

Suppose in Example 20.1 that cutting force and thrust force are measured dur- ing an orthogonal cutting operation: $F_{c}=1559\,\mathrm{N}$  and $F_{t}=1271$  N. The width  of the orthogonal cutting operation $w=3.0\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Based on these data, deter- mine the shear strength of the work material.  

Solution:  From Example 20.1, rake angle $\alpha=10^{\circ}$ , and shear plane angle $\phi=$ $25.4^{\circ}$ . Shear force can be computed from Equation (20.11):  

$$
F_{s}=1559\cos25.4-1271\sin25.4=863\:\mathrm{N}
$$  

The shear plane area is given by Equation (20.8):  

$$
A_{s}={\frac{(0.5)(3.0)}{\sin25.4}}=3.497\:\mathrm{mm}^{2}
$$  

Thus the shear stress, which equals the shear strength of the work material, is  

$$
\tau=S={\frac{863}{3.497}}=247\;\mathrm{N}/\mathrm{mm}^{2}=247\;\mathrm{MPa}

For a tested hardness of HB = 182, TS = 500(182) = 91,000 lb/in2.","To solve this problem, we will apply the formula for computing the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN), and then use it to estimate the tensile strength for steel. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

### (a) Determine the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN):

The Brinell Hardness Number is calculated using the following formula:

\[
\text{BHN} = \frac{2P}{\pi D (D - \sqrt{D^2 - d^2})}
\]

where:
- \( P \) is the load applied in kilograms (1500 kg). It needs to be converted into Newtons (N) using the conversion factor where 1 kg = 9.81 N, so \( P = 1500 \times 9.81 \, \text{N} \).
- \( D \) is the diameter of the indenter in millimeters (10 mm).
- \( d \) is the diameter of the indentation in millimeters (3.2 mm).

#### Step 1: Convert the load from kilograms to Newtons

\[
P = 1500 \, \text{kg} \times 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 14715 \, \text{N}
\]

#### Step 2: Substitute the values into the formula

\[
\text{BHN} = \frac{2 \times 14715}{\pi \times 10 \times \left(10 - \sqrt{10^2 - 3.2^2}\right)}
\]

We first calculate \( \sqrt{10^2 - 3.2^2} \):

\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
3.2^2 = 10.24
\]
\[
100 - 10.24 = 89.76
\]
\[
\sqrt{89.76} \approx 9.47
\]

Now, substitute back into the formula:

\[
\text{BHN} = \frac{2 \times 14715}{\pi \times 10 \times (10 - 9.47)}
\]
\[
\text{BHN} = \frac{29430}{\pi \times 10 \times 0.53}
\]
\[
\text{BHN} = \frac{29430}{1.67} \approx 17633.53
\]

After calculation:

\[
\text{BHN} \approx 660.26
\]

### (b) Estimate the tensile strength of the steel.

For steel, an empirical relationship between the Brinell hardness number and the tensile strength is given by:

\[
\text{Tensile Strength (MPa)} \approx 3.45 \times \text{BHN}
\]

Substitute the BHN value we calculated:

\[
\text{Tensile Strength (MPa)} \approx 3.45 \times 660.26 \approx 2277.90 \, \text{MPa}
\]

"One of the inspectors in the quality control department has frequently used the Brinell and Rockwell hardness tests, for which equipment is available in the company. He claims that all hardness tests are based on the same principle as the Brinell test, which is that hardness is always measured as the applied load divided by the area of the impressions made by an indentor. (a) Is he correct? (b) If not, what are some of the other principles involved in hardness testing, and what are the associated tests?","Solution: (a) No, the claim is not correct. Not all hardness tests are based on the applied load divided by area, but many of them are. (b) Some of the other hardness tests and operating principles include: (1) Rockwell hardness test, which measures the depth of indentation of a cone resulting from an applied load; (2) Scleroscope, which measures the rebound height of a hammer dropped from a certain distance against a surface specimen; and (3) Durometer, which measures elastic deformation by pressing an indentor into the surface of rubber and similar soft materials.","Certainly! Let's address each part of the question systematically.

### (a) Is he correct?

No, the inspector's claim is not entirely correct. While the Brinell hardness test measures hardness as the applied load divided by the area of the impression, not all hardness tests use this exact principle. Each hardness test has its unique methodology and calculations.

### (b) What are some of the other principles involved in hardness testing, and what are the associated tests?

Various hardness tests exist, each based on different principles. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Brinell Hardness Test:**
   - **Principle:** Involves pressing a hard, spherical indentor into the material under a specific load and measuring the diameter of the impression.
   - **Formula:** 
     \[
     \text{Brinell Hardness Number (BHN)} = \frac{2P}{\pi D \left( D - \sqrt{D^2 - d^2} \right)}
     \]
     where \(P\) is the load, \(D\) is the diameter of the sphere, and \(d\) is the diameter of the impression.

2. **Rockwell Hardness Test:**
   - **Principle:** Measures the depth of penetration under a large load with a preliminary minor load applied initially.
   - **Measurement:** Different scales (A, B, C, etc.) use different loads and indenters (spherical or conical).
   - **Readout:** Provides a direct hardness number based on depth comparison.

3. **Vickers Hardness Test:**
   - **Principle:** Uses a diamond pyramid indentor with a square base, and the load is applied for a specific time.
   - **Formula:**
     \[
     \text{Vickers Hardness Number (VHN)} = \frac{1.854 \times P}{d^2}
     \]
     where \(P\) is the applied load and \(d\) is the diagonal length of the indentation.
   
4. **Knoop Hardness Test:**
   - **Principle:** Similar to Vickers but uses an elongated diamond pyramid, providing better results for brittle materials or coatings.
   - **Formula:**
     \[
     \text{Knoop Hardness Number (KHN)} = \frac{P}{L^2 C}
     \]
     where \(P\) is the load, \(L\) is the length of the indentation, and \(C\) is a constant related to the indenter geometry.

5. **Shore Hardness Test (Durometer):**
   - **Principle:** Measures the resistance of a material to penetration by a specific indentor under a spring load.
   - **Application:** Commonly used for rubbers and polymers.
   - **Measurement:** Provides a Shore hardness value directly from the device.

### Final Answer:

(a) No, the inspector is not correct. Not all hardness tests are based on the principle of applied load divided by the area of the impression.

(b) Other principles involved in hardness testing include measuring the depth of indentation (Rockwell), penetration resistance (Shore), and indentation geometry adjustments for specific materials (Vickers, Knoop).

"A batch of annealed steel has just been received from the vendor. It is supposed to have a tensile strength in the range 60,000 -70,000 lb/in2. A Brinell hardness test in the receiving department yields a value of HB = 118. (a) Does the steel meet the specification on tensile strength?","Solution: (a) TS = 500(HB) = 500(118) = 59,000 lb/in2. This lies outside the specified range of 60,000 to 70,000 lb/in2. However, from a legal standpoint, it is unlikely that the batch can be rejected on the basis of its measured Brinell hardness number without using an actual tensile test to measure TS. The formula for converting from Brinell hardness number to tensile strength is only an approximating equation. ","To determine whether the steel meets the specified tensile strength range, we need to convert the Brinell Hardness Number (HB) to tensile strength. There's a known empirical relationship between Brinell hardness and tensile strength for steel, which can be approximated as:

\[ \text{Tensile Strength (psi)} = \text{HB} \times C \]

where \( C \) is a conversion factor. For steel, this factor is typically around 500 psi, though it can vary slightly depending on specific steel composition and treatment. For the purpose of this calculation, we'll use \( C = 500 \) psi.

### Steps:

1. **Identify Known Values:**
   - Brinell Hardness Number (HB) = 118
   - Conversion Factor (C) = 500 psi

2. **Calculate Tensile Strength:**
   \[
   \text{Tensile Strength} = 118 \times 500
   \]

3. **Perform the Calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Tensile Strength} = 59,000 \text{ psi}

   - Given specification range for tensile strength: 60,000 - 70,000 psi

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The calculated tensile strength of 59,000 psi is slightly below the specified range of 60,000 - 70,000 psi.

(b) Estimate the yield strength of the material.","Solution:  (b) Based on Table 3.2 in the text, the ratio of Y to TS for low carbon steel = 25,000/45,000 =0.555. Using this ratio, we can estimate the yield strength to be Y = 0.555(59,000) = 32,700 lb/in2.","To estimate the yield strength of the material using the Brinell Hardness Number (HB), one can use an empirical relationship that provides a rough approximation of the tensile properties of steel. One commonly used formula for estimating the yield strength (\(\sigma_Y\)) from the Brinell Hardness Number is:

\[
\sigma_Y = \frac{HB}{C}
\]

where:
- \(\sigma_Y\) is the yield strength in psi (pounds per square inch),
- \(HB\) is the Brinell Hardness Number,
- \(C\) is an empirical constant. For carbon steels, this constant is often around 0.3.

Given that the Brinell hardness value \(HB\) is 118, we can substitute this value into the formula to estimate the yield strength:

\[
\sigma_Y = \frac{118}{0.3} = 393.33 \, \text{MPa}
\]

To convert from megapascals (MPa) to pounds per square inch (psi), we use the conversion factor:
1 MPa = 145.0377 psi.

Therefore, converting 393.33 MPa to psi:
\[
\sigma_Y = 393.33 \times 145.0377 \approx 57050 \, \text{psi}
\]

Thus, the estimated yield strength of the annealed steel is approximately 57,050 psi. However, it's important to note that this is an estimation, and actual values can differ due to material and processing variations. Further testing would be recommended for precise applications.

The estimated yield strength of the material is approximately 57,050 psi.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.27

Assuming that the velocity gradient of the fluid is constant, determine the coefficient of viscosity of the fluid.",Solution: Shear rate = (5 m/s x 1000 mm/m)/(4 mm) = 1250 s-1 K = (10N/m2)/(1250 s-1) = 0.008 N-s/m2 = 0.008 Pa-s,"To determine the coefficient of viscosity of the fluid, we can use the formula for shear stress in a fluid:

\[

where:
- \(\tau\) is the shear stress (10 Pa in this case),
- \(\eta\) is the coefficient of viscosity,

If the velocity gradient in the space between the surfaces is constant, determine the viscosity of the fluid.",Solution: Shear rate = (25 in/sec)/(0.5 in) = 50 sec-1 K = (0.3 lb/in2)/(50 sec-1) = 0.0006 lb-sec/in2.,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the viscosity of the fluid using the relationship between shear stress, viscosity, and the velocity gradient. This can be determined using Newton's law of viscosity, which states:

\[
\tau = \mu \left( \frac{du}{dy} \right)
\]

where:
- \(\tau\) is the shear stress (in lb/in²),
- \(\mu\) is the dynamic viscosity (in lb·s/in²),
- \(\frac{du}{dy}\) is the velocity gradient (the change in velocity per unit distance, in s⁻¹).

### Given Data:
- Shear stress, \(\tau = 0.3 \text{ lb/in}^2\)
- Velocity of one surface relative to the other, \(du = 25 \text{ in/s}\)
- Distance between the surfaces, \(dy = 0.5 \text{ in}\)

### Calculate the Velocity Gradient:

The velocity gradient \(\frac{du}{dy}\) is calculated as the change in velocity (\(du\)) across the fluid layer divided by the distance between the surfaces (\(dy\)):

\[
\frac{du}{dy} = \frac{25 \text{ in/s}}{0.5 \text{ in}} = 50 \text{ s}^{-1}

The shaft rotates at a velocity of 400 rev/min; this speed and the action of the oil are sufficient to keep the shaft centered inside the bushing. Determine the magnitude of the torque due to viscosity that acts to resist the rotation of the shaft.,Solution: Bushing internal bearing area A = (125.6)^2 x 50/4 = 19729.6 mm2 = 19729.2(10^-6) m2 d = (125.6 -125)/2 = 0.3 mm v = (125pi mm/rev)(400 rev/min)(1 min/60 sec) = 2618.0 mm/s Shear rate = 2618/0.3 = 8726.6 s-1     W = (0.14)(8726.6) = 1221.7 Pa = 1221.7 N/mm2 Force on surface between shaft and bushing = (1221.7 N/mm2)(19729.2(10^-6)) = 24.1 N Torque T = 24.1 N x 125/2 mm = 1506.4 N-mm = 1.506 N-m,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the torque due to the viscosity of the lubricating oil that acts to resist the rotation of the shaft. We can use the concept of viscous shear and the formula for the torque in a cylindrical configuration.

### Given Parameters:
- Shaft diameter (\(d_1\)) = 125.0 mm
- Bushing inside diameter (\(d_2\)) = 125.6 mm
- Bushing length (\(L\)) = 50.0 mm
- Viscosity of oil (\(\mu\)) = 0.14 Pa·s
- Rotational speed of the shaft = 400 rev/min

### Conversions:
1. Convert diameters from mm to meters:
   - \(d_1 = 125.0 \, \text{mm} = 0.125 \, \text{m}\)
   - \(d_2 = 125.6 \, \text{mm} = 0.1256 \, \text{m}\)

2. Calculate the clearance (gap \(h\)) between the shaft and the bushing:

### Calculate Shear Stress:
The shear stress (\(\tau\)) due to viscosity in the oil film can be calculated using:
\[
\tau = \mu \times \frac{v}{h}
\]
where \(v\) is the tangential (linear) velocity of the shaft surface, given by:
\[
v = \omega \times \frac{d_1}{2} = \left(\frac{40\pi}{3}\right) \times \frac{0.125}{2}

Calculate \(v\):
\[
v = \frac{40\pi}{3} \times 0.0625 = \frac{40\pi \times 0.0625}{3} \approx 2.618 \, \text{m/s}

Calculate \(\tau\):
\[
\tau = 0.14 \, \text{Pa} \cdot \text{s} \times \frac{2.618}{0.0003} \approx 0.14 \times 8726.67 \approx 1222.67 \, \text{Pa}
\]

### Calculate Torque:
The torque (\(T\)) required to overcome this shear stress over the cylindrical surface area of the shaft is:
\[
T = \tau \times \text{Area} \times \frac{d_1}{2}
\]
where the cylindrical area is \(A = \pi \times d_1 \times L\).

Calculate the area:
\[
A = \pi \times 0.125 \times 0.050 \approx 0.01963495 \, \text{m}^2

Calculate the torque:
\[
T = 1222.67 \, \text{Pa} \times 0.01963495 \, \text{m}^2 \times \frac{0.125}{2}

However, I can guide you through the general process of solving such a problem using principles of thermal contraction if you provide the coefficient of linear thermal expansion for the shaft material.

Here's a general approach to solve this type of problem:

**Given:**
- Initial Diameter of Shaft \( d_i = 25.00 \) mm
- Final Diameter Required \( d_f = 24.98 \) mm
- Room Temperature \( T_i = 20^\circ C \)
- Coefficient of Linear Expansion of the material of the shaft \( \alpha \) (usually given in units per degree Celsius, such as \( \mu m/m \cdot ^\circ C \))

**Objective:**
Find the final temperature \( T_f \) where the shaft's diameter becomes \( 24.98 \) mm.

**Formula:**
The change in dimension due to temperature change can be given by the formula:
\[ \Delta L = \alpha \cdot L_i \cdot \Delta T \]

Where:
- \( \Delta L \) is the change in length (or diameter in this case),
- \( \alpha \) is the coefficient of linear expansion,
- \( L_i \) is the initial length (or diameter),
- \( \Delta T \) is the change in temperature.

1. **Calculate the change in diameter \(\Delta d\):**
   \[
   \Delta d = d_f - d_i = 24.98 \, \text{mm} - 25.00 \, \text{mm} = -0.02 \, \text{mm}
   \]

2. **Use the linear expansion formula:**
   \[
   \Delta d = \alpha \cdot d_i \cdot (T_f - T_i)
   \]

3. **Solve for the final temperature \( T_f \):**
   \[
   -0.02 \, \text{mm} = \alpha \cdot 25.00 \, \text{mm} \cdot (T_f - 20^\circ C)
   \]
   Rearrange the formula to solve for \( T_f \):
   \[
   T_f = 20^\circ C + \frac{-0.02 \, \text{mm}}{\alpha \cdot 25.00 \, \text{mm}}
   \]

4. **Substitute \(\alpha\):**
   You will need the value of \( \alpha \) to perform this calculation. Insert \(\alpha\) into the equation to find \(T_f\).

Once you substitute the coefficient of linear expansion value for \( \alpha \) in the material of the shaft, you can calculate the final temperature \( T_f \).

We will use the coefficient of thermal expansion to find the change in volume, and consequently, the change in density.

### Given Data:
- Initial density of aluminum at room temperature (20°C): 2.70 g/cm³
- Coefficient of linear thermal expansion of aluminum: \(\alpha = 23 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{°C}^{-1}\)
- Initial temperature: \(T_1 = 20 \, \text{°C}\)
- Final temperature: \(T_2 = 650 \, \text{°C}\)

### Steps:

1. **Calculate the Change in Temperature:**
   \[
   \Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = 650 \, \text{°C} - 20 \, \text{°C} = 630 \, \text{°C}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Change in Volume:**
   The volumetric thermal expansion coefficient (\(\beta\)) is approximately three times the linear expansion coefficient:
   \[
   \beta = 3 \alpha = 3 \times 23 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{°C}^{-1} = 69 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{°C}^{-1}
   \]
   The change in volume (\(\Delta V\)) is given by \(\Delta V/V_0 = \beta \Delta T\).

   \[
   \Delta V/V_0 = 69 \times 10^{-6} \times 630 = 0.04347
   \]

3. **Calculate the Final Volume:**
   Since the initial volume \(V_0\) is 1 cm³ for the original density:
   \[
   V_f = V_0 (1 + \Delta V/V_0) = 1 \times (1 + 0.04347) = 1.04347 \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

4. **Calculate the Final Density:**
   Density is inversely proportional to volume. Therefore, the final density (\(\rho_f\)) can be calculated as:
   \[
   \rho_f = \frac{\rho_0}{V_f/V_0} = \frac{2.70}{1.04347} \approx 2.59 \, \text{g/cm}^3

as an ore because of its higher Ti content. In recovery of the metal from its ores, the  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  is converted to titanium tetrachloride  $\mathrm{(TiCl_{4})}$  by reacting the compound with  chlorine gas. This is followed by a sequence of distillation steps to remove impurities.  The  highly concentrated  $\mathrm{TiCl_{4}}$  is then reduced to metallic titanium by reaction with  magnesium; this is known as the  Kroll process . Sodium can also be used as a reduc-  ing agent. In either case, an inert atmosphere must be maintained to prevent $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ , $\mathbf{N}_{2}$ ,  or $\mathrm{H}_{2}$  from contaminating the Ti, owing to its chemical affinity for these gases. The  resulting metal is used to cast ingots of titanium and its alloys.  

Properties of Titanium  Ti’s coefficient of thermal expansion is relatively low  among metals. It is stiffer and stronger than aluminum, and it retains good strength  at elevated temperatures. Pure titanium is reactive, which presents problems in  processing, especially in the molten state. However, at room temperature it forms  a thin adherent oxide coating $\left(\mathrm{TiO}_{2}\right)$  that provides excellent corrosion resistance.  

These properties give rise to two principal application areas for titanium: (1) in  the commercially pure state, Ti is used for corrosion resistant components, such as  marine components and prosthetic implants; and (2) titanium alloys are used as  high-strength components in temperatures ranging from ambient to above  $550^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ $(1000^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ), especially where its excellent strength-to-weight ratio is exploited. These  latter applications include aircraft and missile components. Some of the alloying  elements used with titanium include aluminum, manganese, tin, and vanadium.  Some compositions and mechanical properties for several alloys are presented in  Table 6.13.

Table 6.1(g) lists basic data on zinc. Its low melting point makes it attractive as a  casting metal. It also provides corrosion protection when coated onto steel or iron;  galvanized steel  is steel that has been coated with zinc. The following nine sections cover the nonferrous  metals that are the most commercially and technologically important.

Aluminum and magnesium are light metals, and they are often specified in engineer-  ing applications for this feature. Both elements are abundant on Earth, aluminum  on land and magnesium in the sea, although neither is easily extracted from their  natural states.  

Properties and other data on aluminum are listed in Table 6.1(b). Among the  major metals, it is a relative newcomer, dating only to the late 1800s (Historical  Note 6.2). The coverage in this section includes (1) a brief description of how alumi-  num  is produced and (2) a discussion of the properties and the designation system for  the metal and its alloys.

Aluminum Production  The principal aluminum ore is  bauxite , which consists  largely of hydrated aluminum oxide  $(\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}–\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O})$ ) and other oxides. Extraction of  the aluminum from bauxite can be summarized in three steps: (1) washing and  crushing the ore into fine powders; (2) the Bayer process, in which the bauxite is  converted to pure alumina  $\left(\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$ ; and (3) electrolysis, in which the alumina is  separated into aluminum and oxygen gas  $(\mathrm{O}_{2})$ . The  Bayer process , named after the  German chemist who developed it, involves solution of bauxite powders in aque-  ous caustic soda (NaOH) under pressure, followed by precipitation of pure $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ from solution. Alumina is commercially important in its own right as an engineering  ceramic (Chapter 7). These code letters  are listed in Table 6.9. The letters are followed by a two-digit number that indicates,  respectively, the amounts of the two alloying ingredients to the nearest percent.  Finally, the last symbol is a letter that indicates some variation in composition, or

# 6.3.3 COPPER AND ITS ALLOYS  

Copper  $(\mathrm{Cu})$  is one of the oldest metals known (Historical Note 6.3). Basic data on  the element copper are presented in Table 6.1(d).  

# Historical Note 6.3   Copper  

Copper was one of the first metals used by human later found that copper mixed with tin could be more cultures  (gold was the other). Discovery of the metal  readily cast and worked than the pure metal. This led was probably  around 6000  B . C . E . At that time, copper  to the widespread use of bronze and the subsequent was found in the  free metallic state.

ting the metal (cold forging). Pounding copper made it   harder (strain hardening); this and its attractive reddish  color made it valuable in early civilizations.  

Around 4000  B . C . E ., it was discovered that copper  

To the ancient Romans, the island of Cyprus was al-  most the only source of copper. They called the metal  aes cyprium  (ore of Cyprus). This was shortened to  Cyprium  and subsequently renamed  Cuprium . From  

Copper Production  In ancient times, copper was available in nature as a free  element. Today these natural deposits are more difficult to find, and copper is now  extracted from ores that are mostly sulfides, such as  chalcopyrite  $\left(\mathrm{CuFeS}_{2}\right)$ ). The ore  is crushed (Section 16.1.1), concentrated by flotation, and then  smelted  (melted or  fused, often with an associated chemical reaction to separate a metal from its ore).  The resulting copper is called  blister copper , which is between $98\%$  and $99\%$  pure.  Electrolysis is used to obtain higher purity levels suitable for commercial use.  

Properties and Designation Scheme  Pure copper has a distinctive reddish- pink  color, but its most distinguishing engineering property is its low electrical resistivity— one of the lowest of all elements. Because of this property, and its rela- tive abundance  in nature, commercially pure copper is widely used as an electrical conductor. (The  conductivity of copper decreases significantly as alloying elements are added.)  $\mathrm{Cu}$  is  also an excellent thermal conductor.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec12456.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec12456.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec12456.txt","0.8110961981233396, 0.8088083547868126, 0.8073535854497993",4.0,4.3
"With reference to Table 4.1, determine the increase in length of a steel bar whose length = 10.0 in, if the bar is heated from room temperature of 70F to 500F.",Solution: Increase = (6.7 x 10^-6 in/in/F)(10.0 in)(500F -70F) = 0.0288 in.,"To determine the increase in length of a steel bar when heated from room temperature (70°F) to 500°F, we use the formula for linear thermal expansion:

\[
\Delta L = a \cdot L_1 \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]

Where:
- \( \Delta L \) is the change in length.
- \( a \) is the coefficient of thermal expansion for steel.
- \( L_1 \) is the initial length of the bar.
- \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) are the initial and final temperatures, respectively.

**Given:**
- \( L_1 = 10.0 \) in.
- \( T_1 = 70^\circ \mathrm{F} \)
- \( T_2 = 500^\circ \mathrm{F} \)
- Coefficient of thermal expansion for steel, \( a = 6.5 \times 10^{-6} \) \( \mathrm{in/in^\circ F} \).

**Steps:**

1. Calculate the temperature change:  
   \[
   \Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = 500 - 70 = 430^\circ \mathrm{F}
   \]

2. Apply the formula for linear expansion:  
   \[
   \Delta L = (6.5 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot 10.0 \cdot 430
   \]

3. Perform the multiplication:  
   \[
   \Delta L = 6.5 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 4300 \approx 0.02795 \, \text{in.}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The increase in length of the steel bar is approximately \(0.028\) inches.","The change in  length corresponding to a given temperature change is given by:  

$$
L_{2}-L_{1}=a L_{1}\left(T_{2}-T_{1}\right)
$$  

where $a=$   coefficient of thermal expansion, $^{\circ}\mathbf{C}^{\cdot1}(^{\circ}\mathbf{F}^{\cdot1})$ ; and $L_{1}$  and $L_{2}$  are lengths,  mm (in), corresponding, respectively, to temperatures $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2},\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\ (^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ .  

Values of coefficient of thermal expansion given in Table 4.1 suggest that it has  a linear relationship with temperature. This is only an approximation. Not only is  length affected by temperature, but the thermal expansion coefficient itself is also  affected. For some materials it increases with temperature; for other materials it  decreases. These changes are usually not significant enough to be of much concern,  and values like those in the table are quite useful in design calculations for the range  of temperatures contemplated in service. Changes in the coefficient are more sub-  stantial when the metal undergoes a phase transformation, such as from solid to  liquid, or from one crystal structure to another.  

In manufacturing operations, thermal expansion is put to good use in shrink fit  and expansion fit assemblies (Section 31.3), in which a part is heated to increase its  size or cooled to decrease its size to permit insertion into some other part. When the  part returns to ambient temperature, a tightly fitted assembly is obtained. Thermal  expansion can be a problem in heat treatment (Chapter 26) and welding (Section  29.6) because of thermal stresses that develop in the material during these processes.  

# 4.1.3  MELTING  CHARACTERISTICS  

For a pure element, the  melting point $T_{m}$   is the temperature at which the mate- rial  transforms from solid to liquid state. The reverse transformation, from liquid to  solid,  occurs at the same temperature and is called the  freezing point . For crystalline  elements,  such as metals, the melting and freezing temperatures are the same. A cer- tain  amount of heat energy, called the  heat of fusion , is required at this temperature to  accomplish the transformation from solid to liquid.  

Melting of a metal element at a specific temperature assumes equilibrium condi-  tions. Exceptions occur in nature; for example, when a molten metal is cooled, it may  remain in the liquid state below its freezing point if nucleation of crystals does not  initiate immediately. When this happens, the liquid is said to be  supercooled .  

There are other variations in the melting process—differences in the way melt-  ing occurs in different materials. For example, unlike pure metals, most metal alloys  do not have a single melting point. Instead, melting begins at a certain temperature,   called the  solidus , and continues as   the temperature increases until finally convert-  ing completely to the liquid state at a temperature called the  liquidus . Between the  two temperatures, the alloy is a mixture of solid and molten metals, the amounts of  each being inversely proportional to their relative distances from the liquidus and  solidus. Although most alloys behave in this way, exceptions are eutectic alloys that  

FIGURE 4.1  Changes  in volume per unit  weight (1/density) as a  function of temperature  for a hypothetical pure  metal, alloy, and glass;  all exhibiting similar  thermal expansion and  melting  characteristics.

melt (and freeze) at a single temperature. These issues are examined in the discus-  sion of phase diagrams in Chapter 6.  

Another difference in melting occurs with noncrystalline materials (glasses). In  these materials, there is a gradual transition from solid to liquid states. The solid  material gradually softens as temperature increases, finally becoming liquid at the  melting point. During softening, the material has a consistency of increasing plasticity  (increasingly like a fluid) as it gets closer to the melting point.  

These differences in melting characteristics among pure metals, alloys, and glass  are portrayed in Figure 4.1. These assembly methods are used to ﬁ  t gears, pulleys, sleeves,  and other components onto solid and hollow shafts.  

Various methods are used to heat and/or cool the work parts. Heating equip- ment includes torches, furnaces, electric resistance heaters, and electric induction  heaters. Cooling methods include conventional refrigeration, packing in dry ice,  and immersion in cold liquids, including liquid nitrogen. The resulting change in  diameter depends on the coefﬁ  cient of thermal expansion and the temperature  difference that is applied to the part. If it is assumed that the heating or cooling  has produced a uniform temperature throughout the work, then the change in di- ameter is given by  

$$
D_{2}\!-\!D_{1}=\alpha\,D_{1}(T_{2}\!-\!T_{1})
$$  

where $\alpha=$  the coefﬁ  cient of linear thermal expansion, $\mathrm{mm/mm\cdot^{\circ}C}$  (in/in- $\mathrm{\cdot^{\circ}F}$ ) for the  material (see Table 4.1);  $T_{2}=$  the temperature to which the parts have been heated  or cooled, $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $\mathrm{(^{\circ}F)}$ ;  $T_{1}=$  starting ambient temperature;  $D_{2}=$  diameter of the part at  $T_{2},\mathrm{mm}$ $D_{\scriptscriptstyle1}=$  diameter of the part at  $T_{1}$ .  

Equations (31.5) through (31.9) for computing interference pressures and  effective stresses can be used to determine the corresponding values for shrink and  expansion ﬁ  ts.  

# Example 31.2  Expansion ﬁ  t  

An alloy steel shaft is to be inserted into a collar of the same metal using an  expansion ﬁ  t. At room temperature  $(20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ , the outer and inner diameters  of the collar $=50.00\:\mathrm{mm}$  and  $30.00\:\mathrm{mm}$ , respectively, and the shaft has a  diameter  $=30.015\:\mathrm{mm}$ . The shaft must be reduced in size for assembly into  the collar by cooling to a sufﬁ  ciently low temperature that there is a  clearance of  $0.03\;\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) the temperature to which the shaft  must be cooled for assembly, (b) the radial pressure at room temperature  after assembly, and (c) the maximum effective stress on the collar.

Solution:  (a) From Table 4.1, the coefﬁ  cient of thermal expansion for steel  $\alpha=12(10^{-6})\mathrm{\,^{\circ}C^{-1}}$ . Rearranging Equation 31.10 to solve for the cooling  temperature,  

$$
T_{2}={\frac{(D2-D_{1})}{\alpha\,D_{1}}}+\,T_{1}={\frac{(30.00-0.03)-30.015}{12(10^{-6})(30.015)}}+20=-124.9+20=-104.9^{\circ}{\bf C}

a second. When the power is turned off, the area, usually a narrow line as in the  ﬁ  gure, is quenched by heat transfer to the surrounding metal. Depth of the treated  area is around  $0.63\ \mathrm{mm}$  (0.025 in.); hardness depends on carbon content of the  steel and can range up to  $60\,\mathrm{HRC}$  [11].  

Electron beam  $(E B)$  heating  involves localized surface hardening of steel in  which the electron beam is focused onto a small area, resulting in rapid heat buildup.  Austenitizing temperatures can often be achieved in less than a second. When the  directed beam is removed, the heated area is immediately quenched and hardened  by heat transfer to the surrounding cold metal. A disadvantage of EB heating is  that best results are achieved when the process is performed in a vacuum. A special  vacuum chamber is needed, and time is required to draw the vacuum, thus slowing  production rates.  

Laser beam  $(L B)$  heating  uses a high-intensity beam of coherent light focused on a  small area. The beam is usually moved along a deﬁ  ned path on the work surface, caus- ing heating of the steel into the austenite region. When the beam is moved, the area  is immediately quenched by heat conduction to the surrounding metal.  Laser  is an  acronym for  l ight  a mpliﬁ  cation by  s timulated  e mission of  r adiation. The advantage of  LB over EB heating is that laser beams do not require a vacuum to achieve best results.  Energy density levels in EB and LB heating are lower than in cutting or welding.

#  Heating and Pouring  

To perform a casting operation, the metal must be heated to a temperature some- what above its melting point and then poured into the mold cavity to solidify. Several  aspects of these two steps are discussed in this section.  

# 10.2.1  HEATING THE METAL  

Heating furnaces of various kinds (Section 11.4.1) are used to heat the metal to a  molten temperature sufﬁ  cient for casting. The heat energy required is the sum of (1)  the heat to raise the temperature to the melting point, (2) the heat of fusion to con- vert it from solid to liquid, and (3) the heat to raise the molten metal to the desired  temperature for pouring. This can be expressed:  

$$
H=\rho\,V\{C_{s}\,(T_{m}-\,T_{o})+\,H_{f}+\,C_{l}\,(T_{p}\,-\,T_{m})\}
$$  

where  $H=$  total heat required to raise the temperature of the metal to the pour- ing temperature, J (Btu); $\rho=$  density,  $\mathrm{{g}/\mathrm{{cm}}^{3}}$   $\left(1\mathrm{b}\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{in}^{3}\right)$ ;  $C_{s}=$  weight speciﬁ  c heat for  the solid metal,  $\mathrm{J/g-C}$  (Btu/lbm-F);  $T_{m}=$  melting temperature of the metal, C (F);  $T_{o}=$  starting temperature—usually ambient,  $\mathrm{C}$  (F);  $H_{f}=$  heat of fusion,  $\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{g}$  ( $\mathrm{{'Bup/}}$ lbm);  $C_{1}=$  weight speciﬁ  c heat of the liquid metal, $\mathrm{J/g-C}$  (Btu/lbm-F);  $T_{p}=$  pouring  temperature, C (F); and  $V=$  volume of metal being heated, $\mathrm{cm}^{3}\left(\mathrm{in}^{3}\right)$ .  

# Example 10.1  Heating metal  for casting  

One cubic meter of a certain eutectic alloy is heated in a crucible from room  temperature to $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  above its melting point for casting. The alloy’s density $=$ $7.5\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , melting point $=800^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , speciﬁ  c heat $=0.33\;\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{g}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  in the solid state  and $0.29\,\mathrm{J/g^{\circ}C}$  in the liquid state; and heat of fusion $=160\,\mathrm{J/g}$ . How much heat  energy must be added to accomplish the heating, assuming no losses?  

Solution :  Assume ambient temperature in the foundry $=25^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and that the  density of the liquid and solid states of the metal are the same. Noting that one  $\mathsf{m}^{3}=10^{6}\,\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , and substituting the property values into Equation (10.1),  

$H=(7.5)\,(10^{6})\{0.33(800-25)+160+0.29\,(100)\}=3335(10^{6})\,\mathrm{J}$ The above equation is of conceptual value, but its computational value is limited,  

notwithstanding the calculation in Example 10.1. Use of Equation (10.1) is com- plicated by the following factors: (1) Speciﬁ  c heat and other thermal properties of  a solid metal vary with temperature, especially if the metal undergoes a change of  phase during heating. (2) A metal’s speciﬁ  c heat may be different in the solid and  liquid states. Noting that one  $\mathsf{m}^{3}=10^{6}\,\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , and substituting the property values into Equation (10.1),  

$H=(7.5)\,(10^{6})\{0.33(800-25)+160+0.29\,(100)\}=3335(10^{6})\,\mathrm{J}$ The above equation is of conceptual value, but its computational value is limited,  

notwithstanding the calculation in Example 10.1. Use of Equation (10.1) is com- plicated by the following factors: (1) Speciﬁ  c heat and other thermal properties of  a solid metal vary with temperature, especially if the metal undergoes a change of  phase during heating. (2) A metal’s speciﬁ  c heat may be different in the solid and  liquid states. (3) Most casting metals are alloys, and most alloys melt over a tem- perature range between a solidus and liquidus rather than at a single melting point;  thus, the heat of fusion cannot be applied so simply as indicated above. (4) The  property values required in the equation for a particular alloy are not readily avail- able in most cases. (5) There are signiﬁ  cant heat losses to the environment during  heating.  

# 10.2.2  POURING THE MOLTEN METAL  

After heating, the metal is ready for pouring. Introduction of molten metal into the  mold, including its ﬂ  ow through the gating system and into the cavity, is a critical  step in the casting process. For this step to be successful, the metal must ﬂ  ow into  all regions of the mold before solidifying. Factors affecting the pouring operation  include pouring temperature, pouring rate, and turbulence.  

The  pouring temperature  is the temperature of the molten metal as it is intro- duced into the mold. What is important here is the difference between the tempera- ture at pouring and the temperature at which freezing begins (the melting point for  a pure metal or the liquidus temperature for an alloy). This temperature difference is  sometimes referred to as the  superheat . This term is also used for the amount of heat  that must be removed from the molten metal between pouring and when solidiﬁ  ca- tion commences [7].  

Pouring rate  refers to the volumetric rate at which the molten metal is poured  into the mold. If the rate is too slow, the metal will chill and freeze before ﬁ  lling the  cavity. If the pouring rate is excessive, turbulence can become a serious problem.  Turbulence  in ﬂ  uid ﬂ  ow is characterized by erratic variations in the magnitude and  direction of the velocity throughout the ﬂ  uid. The ﬂ  ow is agitated and irregular  rather than smooth and streamlined, as in laminar ﬂ  ow. Turbulent ﬂ  ow should be  avoided during pouring for several reasons. It tends to accelerate the formation  of metal oxides that can become entrapped during solidiﬁ  cation, thus degrading  the quality of the casting. Turbulence also aggravates  mold erosion , the gradual  wearing away of the mold surfaces due to impact of the ﬂ  owing molten metal.  The densities of most molten metals are much higher than water and other ﬂ  uids  normally encountered. These molten metals are also much more chemically reac- tive than at room temperature. Consequently, the wear caused by the ﬂ  ow of these  metals in the mold is signiﬁ  cant, especially under turbulent conditions. Erosion is  especially serious when it occurs in the main cavity because the geometry of the  cast part is affected.  

# 10.2.3  ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF POURING  

There are several relationships that govern the ﬂ  ow of liquid metal through  the gating system and into the mold. An important relationship is  Bernoulli’s  theorem , which states that the sum of the energies (head, pressure, kinetic, and  friction) at any two points in a ﬂ  owing liquid are equal. # 28.3.2  HEAT BALANCE IN FUSION WELDING  

The quantity of heat required to melt a given volume of metal depends on (1) the  heat to raise the temperature of the solid metal to its melting point, which depends  on the metal’s volumetric speciﬁ  c heat, (2) the melting point of the metal, and (3)  the heat to transform the metal from solid to liquid phase at the melting point, which  depends on the metal’s heat of fusion. To a reasonable approximation, this quantity  of heat can be estimated by the following equation [5]:  

$$
U_{m}=K T_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}
$$  

where  $U_{m}=$  the unit energy for melting (i.e., the quantity of heat required to melt a  unit volume of metal starting from room temperature), $\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{mm}^{3}\left(\mathrm{Btu}/\mathrm{in}^{3}\right)$ ;  $T_{m}=$ melt- ing point of the metal on an absolute temperature scale, $^{\circ}\mathrm{K}\left(^{\circ}\mathrm{R}\right)$ ; and  $K=$  constant  whose value is $3.33\times10^{-6}$  when the Kelvin scale is used (and  $K=1.467\times10^{-5}$  for  the Rankine temperature scale). Absolute melting temperatures for selected metals  are presented in Table 28.2.  

Not all of the energy generated at the heat source is used to melt the weld metal.  There are two heat transfer mechanisms at work, both of which reduce the amount  of generated heat that is used by the welding process. The situation is depicted in  Figure 28.8. The ﬁ  rst mechanism involves the transfer of heat between the heat source  and the surface of the work. This process has a certain  heat transfer factor $f_{1}$ , deﬁ  ned as  the ratio of the actual heat received by the workpiece divided by the total heat gener- ated at the source. The second mechanism involves the conduction of heat away from  the weld area to be dissipated throughout the work metal, so that only a portion of the  heat transferred to the surface is available for melting. This  melting factor $f_{2}$  is the pro- portion of heat received at the work surface that can be used for melting. The combined  effect of these two factors is to reduce the heat energy available for welding as follows:  

$$
H_{w}=f_{1}f_{2}H
$$

where $H_{w}\!=$  net heat available for welding, J (Btu), $f_{1}=$  heat transfer factor, $f_{2}=$  the  melting factor, and $H=$  the total heat generated by the welding process, J (Btu).  

The factors $f_{1}$  and $f_{2}$  range in value between zero and one. It is appropriate to  separate $f_{1}$  and $f_{2}$  in concept, even though they act in concert during the welding  process. The heat transfer factor $f_{1}$  is determined largely by the welding process and  the capacity to convert the power source (e.g., electrical energy) into usable heat at  the work surface. Arc-welding processes are relatively efﬁ  cient in this regard, while  oxyfuel gas-welding processes are relatively inefﬁ  cient.  

The melting factor $f_{2}$  depends on the welding process, but it is also inﬂ  uenced  by the thermal properties of the metal, joint conﬁ  guration, and work thickness.  Metals with high thermal conductivity, such as aluminum and copper, present a  problem in welding because of the rapid dissipation of heat away from the heat  contact area. The problem is exacerbated by welding heat sources with low energy

What is the resistance R of a length of copper wire whose length = 10 m and whose diameter = 0.10 mm? Use Table 4.3 as a reference.,"Solution: R = rL/A, A = pi(0.1)^2/4 = 0.007854 mm2 = 0.007854(10^-6) m2 From Table 4.3, r = 1.7 x 10^-8 -m2/m  R = (1.7 x 10^-8  ohm-m2/m)(10 m)/( 0.007854(10^-6) m2) = 2164.5(10^-2) : = 21.65 ohm","To find the resistance \( R \) of a copper wire, we use the formula for electrical resistance:

\[
R = \frac{\rho L}{A}
\]

where:
- \( \rho \) is the resistivity of copper (typically \( 1.68 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \)).
- \( L \) is the length of the wire (10 meters).
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the wire.

First, calculate the cross-sectional area \( A \) of the wire. Since the wire is cylindrical, we use the formula for the area of a circle:

\[
A = \pi \left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^2
\]

Given:
- Diameter \( d = 0.10 \, \text{mm} = 0.0001 \, \text{m} \)

Now substitute the diameter into the area formula:

\[
A = \pi \left( \frac{0.0001}{2} \right)^2 = \pi \times (0.00005)^2 = \pi \times 2.5 \times 10^{-9} \approx 7.85 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}^2
\]

Next, substitute the values into the resistance formula:

\[
R = \frac{\rho L}{A} = \frac{1.68 \times 10^{-8} \times 10}{7.85 \times 10^{-9}}
\]

Calculate:

\[
R = \frac{1.68 \times 10^{-7}}{7.85 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 21.4 \, \Omega
\]

The resistance \( R \) of the length of copper wire is approximately \( 21.4 \, \Omega \).","This can be expressed  by the equation

FIGURE 29.12  Resistance welding  (RW), showing the  components in  spot welding, the  predominant process in  the RW group.  

The current used in resistance welding operations is very high (5000–20,000 A,  typically), although voltage is relatively low (usually below  $10\,\mathrm{V}$ ). The duration $t$  of  the current is short in most processes, perhaps lasting 0.1 to  $0.4~\mathrm{s}$  in a typical spot- welding operation.  

The reason why such a high current is used in RW is because (1) the squared term  in Equation (29.3) ampliﬁ  es the effect of current, and (2) the resistance is very low  (around  $0.0001\;\Omega$ ). Resistance in the welding circuit is the sum of (1) resistance of  the electrodes, (2) resistances of the work parts, (3) contact resistances between elec- trodes and work parts, and (4) contact resistance of the faying surfaces. Thus, heat  is generated in all of these regions of electrical resistance. The ideal situation is for  the faying surfaces to be the largest resistance in the sum, because this is the desired  location of the weld. The resistance of the electrodes is minimized by using metals  with very low resistivities, such as copper. Also, the electrodes are often water cooled  to dissipate the heat that is generated there. The work part resistances are a function  of the resistivities of the base metals and the part thicknesses. The contact resist- ances between the electrodes and the parts are determined by the contact areas (i.e.,  size and shape of the electrode) and the condition of the surfaces (e.g., cleanliness  of the work surfaces and scale on the electrode). Finally, the resistance at the faying  surfaces depends on surface ﬁ  nish, cleanliness, contact area, and pressure. No paint,  oil, dirt, or other contaminants should be present to separate the contacting surfaces.  

# Example 29.2  Resistance  welding  

A resistance spot-welding operation performed on two pieces of $2.5\mathrm{-mm}$ -thick  sheet steel uses 12,000 amps for a 0.20-s duration. The electrodes are  $6\,\mathrm{mm}$  in  diameter at the contacting surfaces. Resistance is assumed to be $0.0001\;\Omega$ , and  the resulting weld nugget $6\:\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter and averages $3\:\mathrm{mm}$  in thickness.  The unit melting energy for the metal  $U_{m}=12.0\:\mathrm{J/mm}^{3}$ . What portion of the  heat generated was used to form the weld nugget, and what portion was dis- sipated into the work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air?  

Solution:   The heat generated in the operation is given by Equation (29.3) as.  

$$
H=(12,\!000)^{2}(0.0001)(0.2)=2880\,\mathrm{J}
$$  

The volume of the weld nugget (assumed disc-shaped) is  $\nu=3.0\frac{\pi(6)^{2}}{4}=$ $84.8\;\mathrm{mm}^{3}$ .  

The heat required to melt this volume of metal is  $H w=84.8(12.0)=\mathbf{1018\,J}$ .   The remaining heat,  $\begin{array}{r}{2880{-}1018=1862\;\mathbf{J}}\end{array}$   $(64.7\%$  of the total), is lost into the  work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air. In effect, this loss represents  the combined effect of the heat transfer factor $f_{1}$  and melting factor $f_{2}$   (Section 28.3.2). The heat required to melt this volume of metal is  $H w=84.8(12.0)=\mathbf{1018\,J}$ .   The remaining heat,  $\begin{array}{r}{2880{-}1018=1862\;\mathbf{J}}\end{array}$   $(64.7\%$  of the total), is lost into the  work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air. In effect, this loss represents  the combined effect of the heat transfer factor $f_{1}$  and melting factor $f_{2}$   (Section 28.3.2).  

Success in resistance welding depends on pressure as well as heat. The principal  functions of pressure in RW are to (1) force contact between the electrodes and  the work parts and between the two work surfaces prior to applying current, and  (2) press the faying surfaces together to accomplish coalescence when the proper  welding temperature has been reached.  

General advantages of resistance welding include (1) no ﬁ  ller metal is re- quired, (2) high production rates are possible, (3) lends itself to mechanization and  automation, (4) operator skill level is lower than that required for arc welding, and  (5) good repeatability and reliability. Drawbacks are (1) equipment cost is high— usually much higher than most arc-welding operations, and (2) types of joints that  can be welded are limited to lap joints for most RW processes.  

# 29.2.2  RESISTANCE-WELDING PROCESSES  

The resistance-welding processes of most commercial importance are spot, seam,  and projection welding.  

Resistance Spot Welding  Resistance spot welding is by far the predominant  process in this group. It is widely used in mass production of automobiles, appliances,  metal furniture, and other products made of sheet metal. If one considers that a  typical car body has approximately 10,000 individual spot welds, and that the annual  production of automobiles throughout the world is measured in tens of millions of  units, the economic importance of resistance spot welding can be appreciated.  

Resistance spot welding  (RSW) is an RW process in which fusion of the faying  surfaces of a lap joint is achieved at one location by opposing electrodes. The process  is used to join sheet-metal parts of thickness  $3~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.125 in) or less, using a series  of spot welds, in situations where an airtight assembly is not required. The size and  shape of the weld spot is determined by the electrode tip, the most common elec- trode shape being round, but hexagonal, square, and other shapes are also used. The  resulting weld nugget is typically 5 to  $10\;\mathrm{mm}\;(0.2–0.4\;\mathrm{in})$  in diameter, with a heat- affected zone extending slightly beyond the nugget into the base metals. If the weld  is made properly, its strength will be comparable to that of the surrounding metal.  The steps in a spot welding cycle are depicted in Figure 29.13.  

![](images/3439fb98fe357a6b0093316099324f51525a4ebbc74db2c99922a6a8305f4da0.jpg)  
FIGURE 29.13  (a)  Steps in a resistance  spot-welding (RSW)  cycle, and (b) plot of  squeezing force and  current during cycle.  The sequence is: (1)  parts inserted between  open electrodes, (2)  electrodes close and  force is applied, (3)  weld time—current is  switched on, (4) cur- rent is turned off but  force is maintained or  increased (a reduced  current is sometimes  applied near the end of  this step for stress re- lief in the weld region),  and (5) electrodes are  opened, and the welded  assembly is removed.

Materials used for RSW electrodes consist of two main groups: (1) copper-based  alloys and (2) refractory metal compositions such as copper and tungsten combina- tions. The second group is noted for superior wear resistance. As in most manufactur- ing processes, the tooling in spot welding gradually wears out as it is used. The units of  $R_{H w}$  are watts (current multiplied by voltage), which equal  J/sec. This can be converted to Btu/sec by recalling that $1{\mathrm{~Bun}}=1055{\mathrm{~J}},$ , and thus 1  $\mathrm{Blu/sec}=1055$  watts.  

# Example 29.1  Power in arc  welding  

A gas tungsten arc welding operation is performed at a current of $300\,\mathrm{A}$  and  voltage of $20\,\mathrm{V}.$  The melting factor $f_{2}=0.5$ , and the unit melting energy for the  metal  $U_{m}=10\:\mathrm{J/mm^{3}}$ . Determine (a) power in the operation, (b) rate of heat  generation at the weld, and (c) volume rate of metal welded.  

Solution:   (a) The power in this arc-welding operation is  

$$
P=I E=(300\,\mathrm{A})(20\,\mathrm{V})=\mathbf{6000}\,\mathbf{W}
$$  

(b) From Table 29.1, the heat transfer factor $f_{1}=0.7$ . The rate of heat used for  welding is given by  

$$
R_{H w}=f_{1}\,f_{2}\,I\,E=(0.7)(0.5)(6000)=2100\,\mathrm{W}=2100\,\mathrm{J/s}
$$  

(c) The volume rate of metal welded is  

$R_{V W}=(2100\:\mathrm{J/s})/(10\:\mathrm{J/mm^{3}})=210\:\mathrm{mm^{3}/s}$  

# 29.1.2  AW PROCESSES—CONSUMABLE ELECTRODES  

A number of important arc-welding processes use consumable electrodes. These are  discussed in this section. Symbols for the welding processes are those used by the  American Welding Society.  

Shielded Metal Arc Welding   Shielded metal arc welding  (SMAW) is an AW  process that uses a consumable electrode consisting of a ﬁ  ller metal rod coated with  chemicals that provide ﬂ  ux and shielding. The process is illustrated in Figures 29.2  and 29.3. The welding stick (SMAW is sometimes called  stick welding ) is typically  225 to  $450\;\mathrm{mm}$  (9–18 in) long and 2.5 to  $9.5\;\mathrm{mm}$  (3/32–3/8 in) in diameter. The ﬁ  ller  metal used in the rod must be compatible with the metal to be welded, the com- position usually being very close to that of the base metal. The coating consists of  powdered cellulose (i.e., cotton and wood powders) mixed with oxides, carbonates,  and other ingredients, held together by a silicate binder. Metal powders are also  sometimes included in the coating to increase the amount of ﬁ  ller metal and to add  alloying elements. The heat of the welding process melts the coating to provide a  protective atmosphere and slag for the welding operation. It also helps to stabilize  the arc and regulate the rate at which the electrode melts.

During operation the bare metal end of the welding stick (opposite the welding  tip) is clamped in an electrode holder that is connected to the power source. The hold- er has an insulated handle so that it can be held and manipulated by a human welder.  Currents typically used in SMAW range between 30 and $300\,\mathrm{A}$  at voltages from 15 to  $45\,\mathrm{V}.$  Selection of the proper power parameters depends on the metals being welded,  electrode type and length, and depth of weld penetration required. Power supply,  connecting cables, and electrode holder can be bought for a few thousand dollars.

Since nickel is a metal, the resistivity would increase, causing the resistance to increase. This, in turn, would cause slightly more heat to be generated.","To solve this problem, we need to address two parts: calculating the resistance of the wire and understanding how temperature impacts resistance.
   
### Part (a): Calculate the Resistance of the Wire

**Step 1:** Determine the resistivity of nickel from a standard table of materials (like Table 4.3 mentioned, although not provided here, common resistivity values can be referenced). Nickel typically has a resistivity of approximately \( \rho = 6.84 \times 10^{-7} \ \Omega \cdot \text{m} \).

**Step 2:** Convert dimensions to consistent units.
- The diameter of the wire is given as 0.0508 inches. First, convert this to meters (since resistivity is in \(\Omega\cdot\text{m}\)):
  - \( 0.0508 \text{ in} \times \frac{0.0254 \text{ m}}{1 \text{ in}} = 0.00129032 \ \text{m} \)
  
- The length of the wire is given as 32.8 feet. Convert this to meters:
  - \( 32.8 \text{ ft} \times \frac{0.3048 \text{m}}{1 \text{ft}} = 9.99744 \ \text{m} \)

**Step 3:** Calculate the cross-sectional area \(A\) of the wire.
The wire is circular, so its cross-sectional area can be calculated using the formula:
\[ 
A = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 
\]
Substituting the wire’s diameter:
\[ 
A = \pi \left(\frac{0.00129032 \ \text{m}}{2}\right)^2 \approx 1.307 \times 10^{-6} \ \text{m}^2 
\]

**Step 4:** Apply the formula for resistance \(R\) using:
\[ 
R = \rho \cdot \frac{L}{A} 
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[ 
R = (6.84 \times 10^{-7} \ \Omega \cdot \text{m}) \cdot \frac{9.99744 \ \text{m}}{1.307 \times 10^{-6} \ \text{m}^2} 
\]

**Step 5:** Perform the calculation:
\[ 
R \approx \frac{6.84 \times 10^{-7} \cdot 9.99744}{1.307 \times 10^{-6}} 
\]
\[ 
R \approx 5.236 \times 10^{-3} \ \Omega 
\]

The resistance of the wire is approximately \( 5.236 \ \text{m}\Omega \) or \( 0.005236 \ \Omega \).

### Part (b): Effects of Temperature on Resistance

When the current flows through the wire, the wire heats up, causing an increase in temperature. For most conductors, resistance increases with temperature. This is due to increased thermal energy causing more vigorous atomic vibrations, which in turn, scatter the electrons more, leading to higher resistance.

This temperature dependency of resistance for metals is often characterized by the temperature coefficient of resistance, \(\alpha\). The resistance at a new temperature \(T\) can be calculated using:
\[ 
R_T = R_0 [1 + \alpha (T - T_0)]
\]
where:
- \(R_T\) is the resistance at temperature \(T\),
- \(R_0\) is the original resistance,
- \(T_0\) is the initial temperature,
- \(\alpha\) is the temperature coefficient for nickel (approximately \(0.006 \per{}^{\circ}\text{C}\)).

**Final Answer**: 
(a) The resistance of the wire is approximately \(0.005236 \ \Omega\).
(b) If a current is passed through the wire, its resistance will increase due to the rise in temperature.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,4.0,4.7

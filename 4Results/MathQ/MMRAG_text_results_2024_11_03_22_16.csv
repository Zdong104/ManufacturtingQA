" A tensile test uses a test specimen that has a gage length of 50 mm and an area = 200 mm2. During the test the specimen yields under a load of 98,000 N. The corresponding gage length = 50.23 mm. 
This is the 0.2 percent yield point. The maximum load of 168,000 N is reached at a gage length = 
64.2 mm. D. Determine (a) yield strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, and (c) tensile strength. ","Solution: (a) Y = 98,000/200 = 490 MPa. (b) s = E e Subtracting the 0.2% offset, e = (50.23 -50.0)/50.0 -0.002 = 0.0026 E = s/e = 490/0.0026 = 188.5 x 103 MPa.  (c) TS = 168,000/200 = 840 MPa.  ","To determine the yield strength, modulus of elasticity, and tensile strength from the given tensile test data, we'll follow these steps:

### Given Data:
- Initial gage length \( L_0 = 50 \, \text{mm} \)
- Area \( A = 200 \, \text{mm}^2 \)
- Load at yield point \( F_{\text{yield}} = 98,000 \, \text{N} \)
- Gage length at yield point \( L_{\text{yield}} = 50.23 \, \text{mm} \)
- Maximum load \( F_{\text{max}} = 168,000 \, \text{N} \)
- Gage length at maximum load \( L_{\text{max}} = 64.2 \, \text{mm} \)

### Required:
(a) Yield Strength \(\sigma_{\text{yield}}\)
(b) Modulus of Elasticity \(E\)
(c) Tensile Strength \(\sigma_{\text{tensile}}\)

### (a) Yield Strength \(\sigma_{\text{yield}}\)
The yield strength is the stress at which the material begins to deform plastically. It can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\sigma_{\text{yield}} = \frac{F_{\text{yield}}}{A}
\]

\[
\sigma_{\text{yield}} = \frac{98,000 \, \text{N}}{200 \, \text{mm}^2} = 490 \, \text{MPa}
\]

### (b) Modulus of Elasticity \(E\)
The modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus) is a measure of a material's stiffness and can be derived from the linear portion of the stress-strain curve. First, calculate the engineering strain at yield point:

1. Engineering Strain at Yield Point \(\epsilon_{\text{yield}}\):

\[
\epsilon_{\text{yield}} = \frac{L_{\text{yield}} - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{50.23 \, \text{mm} - 50 \, \text{mm}}{50 \, \text{mm}} = 0.0046
\]

2. Modulus of Elasticity \(E\):

Using Hooke's law for the elastic region:

\[
E = \frac{\sigma_{\text{yield}}}{\epsilon_{\text{yield}}}
\]

\[
E = \frac{490 \, \text{MPa}}{0.0046} \approx 106,522 \, \text{MPa}
\]

### (c) Tensile Strength \(\sigma_{\text{tensile}}\)
Tensile strength is the maximum stress that a material can withstand while being stretched. It can be calculated as:

\[
\sigma_{\text{tensile}} = \frac{F_{\text{max}}}{A}
\]

\[
\sigma_{\text{tensile}} = \frac{168,000 \, \text{N}}{200 \, \text{mm}^2} = 840 \, \text{MPa}
\]

### Conclusion:
- (a) Yield Strength \( \sigma_{\text{yield}} = 490 \, \text{MPa} \)
- (b) Modulus of Elasticity \( E \approx 106,522 \, \text{MPa} \)
- (c) Tensile Strength \( \sigma_{\text{tensile}} = 840 \, \text{MPa} \)",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.01
"A test specimen in a tensile test has a gage length of 2.0 in and an area = 0.5 in2. During the test the specimen yields under a load of 32,000 lb. The corresponding gage length = 2.0083 in. This is the 0.2 percent yield point. The maximum load of 60,000 lb is reached at a gage length = 2.60 in. Determine (a) yield strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, and (c) tensile strength. (d) If fracture occurs at a gage length of 2.92 in, determine the percent elongation. (e) If the specimen necked to an area = 0.25 in2, determine the percent reduction in area.","Solution: (a) Y = 32,000/0.5 = 64,000 lb/in2 (b) s = E e Subtracting the 0.2% offset, e = (2.0083 -2.0)/2.0 -0.002 = 0.00215 E = s/e = 64,000/0.00215 = 29.77 x 106 lb/in2  (c) TS = 60,000/0.5 = 120,000 lb/in2  (d) EL = (2.92 -2.0)/2.0 = 0.92/2.0 = 0.46 = 46%  (e) AR = (0.5 -0.25)/0.5 = 0.50 = 50%","To solve the given problems, we'll address each part separately:

### (a) Yield Strength
The yield strength (\(\sigma_y\)) is the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically. It is determined using the yield load divided by the original cross-sectional area:

\[ 
\sigma_y = \frac{F_y}{A_0} 
\]

where \(F_y = 32,000 \, \text{lb}\) is the yield load, and \(A_0 = 0.5 \, \text{in}^2\) is the original cross-sectional area.

\[
\sigma_y = \frac{32,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} = 64,000 \, \text{psi}
\]

### (b) Modulus of Elasticity
The modulus of elasticity (\(E\)) is the ratio of stress to strain within the elastic limit. Strain (\(\epsilon\)) is the change in length divided by the original length:

1. Calculate the strain at yield:

\[
\epsilon_y = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0} = \frac{2.0083 - 2.0}{2.0} = 0.00415
\]

2. Calculate \(E\) using the formula \(E = \frac{\sigma_y}{\epsilon_y}\):

\[
E = \frac{64,000 \, \text{psi}}{0.00415} = 15,421,686 \, \text{psi}
\]

### (c) Tensile Strength
Tensile strength (\(\sigma_u\)) is the maximum stress experienced by the material. It is determined by the maximum load divided by the original cross-sectional area:

\[
\sigma_u = \frac{F_{\text{max}}}{A_0} = \frac{60,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} = 120,000 \, \text{psi}
\]

### (d) Percent Elongation
Percent elongation is calculated using the formula:

\[
\%\text{ Elongation} = \left(\frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0}\right) \times 100
\]

where \(L_f = 2.92 \, \text{in}\).

\[
\%\text{ Elongation} = \left(\frac{2.92 - 2.0}{2.0}\right) \times 100 = 46\%
\]

### (e) Percent Reduction in Area
The percent reduction in area is determined by:

\[
\%\text{ Reduction in Area} = \left(\frac{A_0 - A_f}{A_0}\right) \times 100
\]

where \(A_f = 0.25 \, \text{in}^2\).

\[
\%\text{ Reduction in Area} = \left(\frac{0.5 - 0.25}{0.5}\right) \times 100 = 50\%

Below is a detailed step-by-step explanation and solution.

### Step 1: Calculate Engineering Stress and Strain

The engineering stress (\(\sigma\)) and engineering strain (\(\epsilon\)) are defined as:

- **Engineering Stress (\(\sigma\))**: \(\sigma = \frac{F}{A_0}\)
- **Engineering Strain (\(\epsilon\))**: \(\epsilon = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0}\)

where:
- \(F\) = applied force
- \(A_0\) = original cross-sectional area
- \(L_0\) = original gage length
- \(L\) = current gage length

Given:
- \(A_0 = 62.5 \, \text{mm}^2\)
- \(L_0 = 125.0 \, \text{mm}\)

Let's calculate the stress and strain for each data point.

#### Data Point Calculations:
1. \(F = 17,793 \, \text{N}\), \(L = 125.23 \, \text{mm}\)
   \[
   \sigma_1 = \frac{17,793}{62.5} = 284.69 \, \text{MPa}
   \]
   \[
   \epsilon_1 = \frac{125.23 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.00184
   \]

2. \(F = 23,042 \, \text{N}\), \(L = 131.25 \, \text{mm}\)
   \[
   \sigma_2 = \frac{23,042}{62.5} = 368.67 \, \text{MPa}
   \]
   \[
   \epsilon_2 = \frac{131.25 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.050
   \]

3. \(F = 27,579 \, \text{N}\), \(L = 140.05 \, \text{mm}\)
   \[
   \sigma_3 = \frac{27,579}{62.5} = 441.26 \, \text{MPa}
   \]
   \[
   \epsilon_3 = \frac{140.05 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.1204
   \]

4. \(F = 28,913 \, \text{N}\), \(L = 147.01 \, \text{mm}\)
   \[
   \sigma_4 = \frac{28,913}{62.5} = 462.61 \, \text{MPa}
   \]
   \[
   \epsilon_4 = \frac{147.01 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.1761
   \]

5. \(F = 27,578 \, \text{N}\), \(L = 153.00 \, \text{mm}\)
   \[
   \sigma_5 = \frac{27,578}{62.5} = 441.25 \, \text{MPa}
   \]
   \[
   \epsilon_5 = \frac{153.00 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.224
   \]

6. \(F = 20,462 \, \text{N}\), \(L = 160.10 \, \text{mm}\)
   \[
   \sigma_6 = \frac{20,462}{62.5} = 327.39 \, \text{MPa}
   \]
   \[
   \epsilon_6 = \frac{160.10 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.2808
   \]

### Step 2: Plot Engineering Stress-Strain Curve

Create a plot with the calculated stress values on the y-axis and strain values on the x-axis.

### Step 3: Determine Yield Strength

The yield strength is typically determined from the point where the stress-strain curve exhibits a noticeable deviation from linearity. If the yield point is not explicit, a 0.2% offset method is commonly used, drawing a line parallel to the initial linear portion of the curve at a 0.002 strain offset. Based on the data points' linear behavior, the yield strength can be approximated.

Here, using the initial linear behavior, approximate:
- For yield strength, visually inspect the plot for onset of non-linear behavior or use the 0.2% offset method on the graph.

### Step 4: Calculate Modulus of Elasticity (E)

The modulus of elasticity is the slope of the initial, linear portion of the stress-strain curve.

- Calculate \(E\) using points in the linear region.
\[
E = \frac{\sigma_2 - \sigma_1}{\epsilon_2 - \epsilon_1} = \frac{368.67 - 284.69}{0.050 - 0.00184} = \frac{83.98}{0.04816} = 1,744.72 \, \text{MPa}
\]

### Step 5: Determine Tensile Strength

Tensile strength is the maximum stress achieved on the stress-strain curve.

- From the data points, the tensile strength is given by the highest stress which is \(\sigma_4 = 462.61 \, \text{MPa}\).

Based on these calculations, you have:
- **Yield Strength**: Approximate from the onset of plastic deformation.
- **Modulus of Elasticity (E)**: 1,744.72 MPa
- **Tensile Strength**: 462.61 MPa",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.03
A tensile test for a certain metal provides flow curve parameters: strain-hardening exponent is 0.3 and strength coefficient is 600 MPa. Determine (a) the flow stress at a true strain = 1.0 and (b) true strain at a flow stress = 600 MPa.,Solution: (a) Yf = 600(1.0)^.3 = 600 MPa (b) H = (600/600)^(1/.3) = (1.0)^3.33 = 1.00,"To solve the problems given, we will use the flow curve equation \(\sigma = K \epsilon^n\), where:
- \(\sigma\) is the true stress,
- \(K\) is the strength coefficient,
- \(\epsilon\) is the true strain,
- \(n\) is the strain-hardening exponent.

Given:
- \(K = 600 \, \text{MPa}\)
- \(n = 0.3\)

### (a) Determine the flow stress at a true strain = 1.0

1. **Substitute values into the flow curve equation:**

   \[
   \sigma = 600 \times (1.0)^{0.3}
   \]

2. **Simplify the expression:**

   Since \( (1.0)^{0.3} = 1\),

   \[
   \sigma = 600 \, \text{MPa}
   \]

Thus, the flow stress at a true strain of 1.0 is **600 MPa**.

### (b) Determine the true strain at a flow stress = 600 MPa

1. **Substitute values into the flow curve equation:**

   \[
   600 = 600 \epsilon^{0.3}
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 600:**

   \[
   \epsilon^{0.3} = 1
   \]

3. **Solve for \(\epsilon\):**

   Raise both sides to the power of \(\frac{1}{0.3}\) to isolate \(\epsilon\):

   \[
   \epsilon = 1^{\frac{1}{0.3}} = 1
   \]

Thus, the true strain at a flow stress of 600 MPa is **1.0**.

These calculations show that at a flow stress of 600 MPa, the true strain is precisely 1.0, consistent with the properties of the material's flow curve.","Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.

FIGURE 3.5  True stress–strain  curve plotted on log–log scale.  

Because it is a straight line in this transformation of the data, the relationship  between true stress and true strain in the plastic region can be expressed as  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

This equation is called the  ﬂ  ow curve , and it provides a good approximation of the  behavior of metals in the plastic region, including their capacity for strain hardening.  The constant $K$  is called the  strength coefﬁ  cient , MPa  $(1{\mathrm{b}}/{\mathrm{in}}^{2}),$  and it equals the value  of true stress at a true strain value equal to one. The parameter  $n$  is called the  strain  hardening exponent , and it is the slope of the line in Figure 3.5. Its value is directly  related to a metal’s tendency to work harden. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for selected  metals are given in Table 3.4.

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine the strength coefﬁ  cient and  strain hardening exponent in the ﬂ  ow curve equation: $\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}$ .  

Solution:  We have two points on the ﬂ  ow curve from which the ﬂ  ow curve  parameters can be determined: (1) at the yield point and (2) at the maximum  load.  

(1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ . (1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ .  

Solving for $n$  and $K$ ,  

(1) $K=160/(0.001998)^{n}$  and (2) $K=375/(0.143)^{n}$   $160/(0.001998)^{n}=375/(0.143)^{n}$  

 $\ln(160)-n\ln(0.001998)=\ln(375)-n\ln(0.143$  ln(0.143)

 $5.0752-(-6.2156)n=5.9269-(-1.9449)n

$ $5.0752+6.2156n=5.9269+1.9449n

$ $(6.2156-1.9449)n=5.9269-5.0752

$ $4.2707n=0.8517$        $n=0.1994$ Substituting back into (1): $K=160/(0.001998)^{0.1994}=552.7$ .  

Check:  Using (2):  $K=375/(0.143)^{0.1994}=552.7.$  

The ﬂ  ow curve equation is $\sigma={\tt552.7}\epsilon^{\tt0.1994}$ .  

Necking in a tensile test and in metal forming operations that stretch the work  part is closely related to strain hardening. As the test specimen is elongated during  the initial part of the test (before necking begins), uniform straining occurs through- out the length because if any element in the specimen becomes strained more than  the surrounding metal, its strength increases by work hardening, thus making it  more resistant to additional strain until the surrounding metal has been strained  an equal amount. Finally, the strain becomes so large that uniform straining cannot  be sustained. A weak point in the length develops (from buildup of dislocations at  grain boundaries, impurities in the metal, or other factors), and necking is initiated,  leading to failure. Empirical evidence reveals that necking begins for a particular  metal when the true strain reaches a value equal to the strain-hardening exponent $n$ .  Therefore, a higher $n$  value means that the metal can be strained further before the  onset of necking during tensile loading.  

Types of Stress–Strain Relationships  Much information about elastic–plastic  behavior is provided by the true stress–strain curve. As indicated, Hooke’s law  ( $\mathit{(\sigma=E\epsilon)}$ ) governs the metal’s behavior in the elastic region, and the ﬂ  ow curve

"The flow curve for a certain metal has a strain-hardening exponent of 0.22 and strength coefficient of 54,000 lb/in2. Determine (a) the flow stress at a true strain = 0.45 and (b) the true strain at a flow stress = 40,000 lb/in2.","Solution: (a) Yf = 54,000(0.45)^.22 = 45,300 lb/in2 (b) H = (40,000/54,000)^(1/.22) = (0.7407)^4.545 = 0.256","To solve this problem, we need to use the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = K\epsilon^n
\]

where:
- \(\sigma\) is the true stress,
- \(K\) is the strength coefficient (\(54,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2\)),
- \(\epsilon\) is the true strain,
- \(n\) is the strain-hardening exponent (0.22).

Let's solve the two parts step by step:

### (a) Determine the flow stress at a true strain \(\epsilon = 0.45\).

1. **Substitute the known values into the flow curve equation**:
   \[
   \sigma = 54,000 \times (0.45)^{0.22}
   \]

2. **Calculate the exponent**:
   \[
   (0.45)^{0.22} \approx 0.741
   \]

3. **Calculate the flow stress**:
   \[
   \sigma = 54,000 \times 0.741 \approx 40,014 \, \text{lb/in}^2
   \]

Thus, the flow stress \(\sigma\) at a true strain of 0.45 is approximately \(40,014 \, \text{lb/in}^2\).

### (b) Determine the true strain when the flow stress \(\sigma = 40,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2\).

1. **Substitute the known values into the flow curve equation**:
   \[
   40,000 = 54,000 \epsilon^{0.22}
   \]

2. **Isolate \(\epsilon^{0.22}\)**:
   \[
   \epsilon^{0.22} = \frac{40,000}{54,000} \approx 0.7407
   \]

3. **Calculate \(\epsilon\) by taking the inverse of the exponent 0.22**:
   \[
   \epsilon = (0.7407)^{\frac{1}{0.22}} \approx 0.448
   \]

Thus, the true strain \(\epsilon\) when the flow stress is \(40,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2\) is approximately 0.448.

These calculations show how the flow curve equation is applied to determine the stress or strain state of a metal in the plastic region.","The typical stress–strain relationship for a metal exhibits elasticity below the  yield point and strain hardening above it. Figures 3.4 and 3.5 indicate this behavior  in linear and logarithmic axes. In the plastic region, the metal’s behavior is expressed  by the ﬂ  ow curve:  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

where $K=$  the strength coefﬁ  cient, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ; and $n$  is the strain hardening expo- nent. The stress  $\sigma$  and strain  $\epsilon$  in the ﬂ  ow curve are true stress and true strain. The  ﬂ  ow curve is generally valid as a relationship that deﬁ  nes a metal’s plastic behavior  in cold working. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for different metals at room temperature  are listed in Table 3.4.  

Flow Stress  The ﬂ  ow curve describes the stress–strain relationship in the region  in which metal forming takes place. It indicates the ﬂ  ow stress of the metal—the  strength property that determines forces and power required to accomplish a par- ticular forming operation. For most metals at room temperature, the stress–strain  plot of Figure 3.5 indicates that as the metal is deformed, its strength increases  due to strain hardening. The stress required to continue deformation must be  increased to match this increase in strength.  Flow stress  is deﬁ  ned as the instan- taneous value of stress required to continue deforming the material—to keep the  metal “ﬂ  owing.” It is the yield strength of the metal as a function of strain, which  can be expressed:  

$$
Y_{f}=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

where  $Y_{f}=$  ﬂ  ow stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ .  

In the individual forming operations discussed in the following two chapters, the  instantaneous ﬂ  ow stress can be used to analyze the process as it is occurring. For  example, in certain forging operations, the instantaneous force during compression  can be determined from the ﬂ  ow stress value. Maximum force can be calculated  based on the ﬂ  ow stress that results from the ﬁ  nal strain at the end of the forging  stroke.  

In other cases, the analysis is based on the average stresses and strains that occur  during deformation rather than instantaneous values. Extrusion represents this case,  Figure 17.2(c). As the billet is reduced in cross section to pass through the extrusion  die opening, the metal gradually strain hardens to reach a maximum value. Rather  than determine a sequence of instantaneous stress–strain values during the reduc- tion, which would be not only difﬁ  cult but also of limited interest, it is more useful to  analyze the process based on the average ﬂ  ow stress during deformation.  

Average Flow Stress  The average ﬂ  ow stress (also called the  mean ﬂ  ow stress ) is  the average value of stress over the stress–strain curve from the beginning of strain  to the ﬁ  nal (maximum) value that occurs during deformation. The value is illustrated  in the stress–strain plot of Figure 17.4. The average ﬂ  ow stress is determined by inte- grating the ﬂ  ow curve equation, Equation (17.1), between zero and the ﬁ  nal strain  value deﬁ  ning the range of interest. This yields the equation:  

$$
\overline{{Y}}_{f}=\frac{K\epsilon^{n}}{1+n}
$$

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.

FIGURE 3.5  True stress–strain  curve plotted on log–log scale.  

Because it is a straight line in this transformation of the data, the relationship  between true stress and true strain in the plastic region can be expressed as  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

This equation is called the  ﬂ  ow curve , and it provides a good approximation of the  behavior of metals in the plastic region, including their capacity for strain hardening.  The constant $K$  is called the  strength coefﬁ  cient , MPa  $(1{\mathrm{b}}/{\mathrm{in}}^{2}),$  and it equals the value  of true stress at a true strain value equal to one. The parameter  $n$  is called the  strain  hardening exponent , and it is the slope of the line in Figure 3.5. Its value is directly  related to a metal’s tendency to work harden. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for selected  metals are given in Table 3.4.

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine the strength coefﬁ  cient and  strain hardening exponent in the ﬂ  ow curve equation: $\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}$ .  

Solution:  We have two points on the ﬂ  ow curve from which the ﬂ  ow curve  parameters can be determined: (1) at the yield point and (2) at the maximum  load.

Then, we will apply these concepts to determine the final compressed length of the specimen for both engineering and true strain in compression.

### Step 1: Calculate Engineering Strain in Tension

**Engineering Strain (\( \epsilon \))** is defined as the change in length divided by the original length:

\[
\epsilon = \frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0}
\]

Where:
- \( L_f \) is the final length of the specimen.
- \( L_0 \) is the original length of the specimen.

Given that the specimen is elongated to twice its original length:

\[
L_f = 2L_0
\]

Substitute into the equation:

\[
\epsilon = \frac{2L_0 - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{L_0}{L_0} = 1
\]

### Step 2: Calculate True Strain in Tension

**True Strain (\( \epsilon_t \))** is the natural logarithm of the ratio of the final length to the original length:

\[
\epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{L_f}{L_0}\right)
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{2L_0}{L_0}\right) = \ln(2)
\]

The numerical value of \(\ln(2)\) is approximately 0.693.

### Step 3: Calculate Final Compressed Length for Engineering Strain in Compression

In compression, the engineering strain should equal -1 (the same magnitude but negative since it is compression):

For engineering strain:
\[
\epsilon = \frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0} = -1
\]

Rearrange to find \( L_f \):

\[
-1 = \frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0} \\
L_f - L_0 = -L_0 \\
L_f = 0
\]

This result indicates that the specimen would have to be compressed to a length of zero, which is impossible physically. This demonstrates the limitation of engineering strain for large deformations in compression.

### Step 4: Calculate Final Compressed Length for True Strain in Compression

For the true strain in compression to be -0.693 (same magnitude as in tension but negative), we use the true strain equation:

\[
\epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{L_f}{L_0}\right) = -0.693
\]

Solving for \( L_f \):

\[
\ln\left(\frac{L_f}{L_0}\right) = -0.693 \\
\frac{L_f}{L_0} = e^{-0.693} \\
L_f = L_0 \times e^{-0.693}
\]

The numerical value of \( e^{-0.693} \) is approximately 0.5:

\[
L_f = L_0 \times 0.5 = 0.5L_0
\]

Thus, the final compressed length that results in a true strain the same as in tension is \( 0.5L_0 \).

### Summary

- Engineering strain in tension: \(\epsilon = 1\)
- True strain in tension: \(\epsilon_t = 0.693\)
- Impossible compressed length for \(\epsilon = -1\): \( L_f = 0\)
- Compressed length for \(\epsilon_t = -0.693\): \( L_f = 0.5L_0 \)

"Derive an expression for true strain as a function of D and Do for a tensile test specimen of round cross section, where D = the instantaneous diameter of the specimen and Do is its original diameter.","Solution: Starting with the definition of true strain as H = ln(L/Lo) and assuming constant volume, we have V = AoLo = AL Therefore, L/Lo = Ao/A       A =pi D^2 and Ao =pi Do^2 and A0=piD^2        Ao/A = piDo^2/piD^2 = (Do/D)2 H = ln(Do/D)2 = 2ln(Do/D)","To derive the expression for true strain as a function of the instantaneous diameter \( D \) and the original diameter \( D_o \), we'll use the concept of volume constancy during plastic deformation for round specimens.

1. **Assume Volume Constancy:**

   For a round specimen undergoing plastic deformation, the volume remains constant. Initially, the volume is:

   \[
   V_o = A_o \times L_o = \left(\frac{\pi D_o^2}{4}\right) \times L_o
   \]

   At the deformed state:

   \[
   V = A \times L = \left(\frac{\pi D^2}{4}\right) \times L
   \]

   By volume constancy, \( V_o = V \):

   \[
   \left(\frac{\pi D_o^2}{4}\right) \times L_o = \left(\frac{\pi D^2}{4}\right) \times L
   \]

2. **Relate Lengths:**

   Canceling out the common terms and solving for \( L \):

   \[
   D_o^2 \times L_o = D^2 \times L
   \]

   \[
   L = \frac{D_o^2 \times L_o}{D^2}
   \]

3. **True Strain Calculation:**

   True strain \(\epsilon_t\) is defined as:

   \[
   \epsilon_t = \int_{L_o}^{L} \frac{dL}{L} = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_o}\right)
   \]

   Substitute \( L = \frac{D_o^2 \times L_o}{D^2} \):

   \[
   \epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{\frac{D_o^2 \times L_o}{D^2}}{L_o}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{D_o^2}{D^2}\right)
   \]

   \[
   \epsilon_t = 2 \ln\left(\frac{D_o}{D}\right)
   \]

This derivation demonstrates that true strain for a round tensile specimen, when expressed in terms of the original and instantaneous diameters, is given by:

\[
\epsilon_t = 2 \ln\left(\frac{D_o}{D}\right)
\]

This formula allows you to calculate the true strain during necking in tensile tests of round specimens using only diameter measurements.","To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

metallic test specimens and the associated nonuniform effect on elongation and area  reduction. Despite these difﬁ  culties, percent elongation and percent area reduction  are the most commonly used measures of ductility in engineering practice.

# Example 3.1  Engineering  stress and strain  

A tensile test specimen has a starting gage length $=50\:\mathrm{mm}$  and a cross-sectional  area $=200\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ . During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.

FIGURE 3.2  Typical  progress of a tensile  test: (1) beginning of  test, no load; (2) uniform  elongation and reduc- tion of cross-sectional  area; (3) continued  elongation, maximum  load reached; (4) neck- ing begins, load begins  to decrease; and (5)  fracture. If pieces are  put back together as in  (6), ﬁ  nal length can be  measured.  

The load and the change in length of the specimen are recorded as testing proceeds,  to provide the data required to determine the stress–strain relationship. There are  two different types of stress–strain curves: (1) engineering stress–strain and (2) true  stress–strain. The ﬁ  rst is more important in design, and the second is more important  in manufacturing.  

Engineering Stress–strain   The engineering stress and strain in a tensile test are  deﬁ  ned relative to the original area and length of the test specimen. These values are  of interest in design because the designer expects that the strains experienced by any  component of the product will not signiﬁ  cantly change its shape. The components  are designed to withstand the anticipated stresses encountered in service.  

A typical engineering stress–strain curve from a tensile test of a metallic speci- men is illustrated in Figure 3.3. The  engineering stress  at any point on the curve is  deﬁ  ned as the force divided by the original area:  

$$
s=\frac{F}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $s=$  engineering stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ );  $F=$  applied force in the test, $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A_{o}=$  original area of the test specimen,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}$   $(\mathrm{in}^{2}]$ ). The  engineering strain  at any  point in the test is given by  

$$
e=\frac{L-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $e\:=\:$  engineering strain,  $\mathrm{mm/mm~(in/in)}$ ;  $L=$ length at any point during the  elongation, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and $L_{o}=$  original gage length, mm (in). The units of engineer- ing strain are given as $\mathrm{mm/mm}$  (in/in), but think of it as representing elongation per  unit length, without units.  

The stress–strain relationship in Figure 3.3 has two regions, indicating two dis- tinct forms of behavior: (1) elastic and (2) plastic. In the elastic region, the relation- ship between stress and strain is linear, and the material exhibits elastic behavior by  

![](images/d0bec5dc14bfbf80832d78675a36196cfd2800b33ec74d7a6c30553b276140c2.jpg)  

returning to its original length when the load (stress) is released. The relationship is  deﬁ  ned by  Hooke’s law :  

$$
s=E e
$$  

where  $E=$   modulus of elasticity  (also known as  Young’s modulus ), MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ,  a measure of the inherent stiffness of a material. It is a constant of proportionality  whose value is different for different materials. Table 3.1 presents typical values for  several materials, metals and nonmetals.  

As stress increases, some point in the linear relationship is ﬁ  nally reached at  which the material begins to yield. This  yield point   $Y$ of the material can be identi- ﬁ  ed in the ﬁ  gure by the change in slope at the end of the linear region. Because the  start of yielding is usually difﬁ  cult to see in a plot of test data (it does not usually oc- cur as an abrupt change in slope), $Y$  is typically deﬁ  ned as the stress at which a strain  offset of  $0.2\%$  from the straight line has occurred.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt","0.8513078552142189, 0.8505190250803765",3.0,3.13

### Step 1: Define the Engineering Strain
Engineering strain \( e \) is defined as the change in length divided by the original length:
\[ 
e = \frac{\Delta L}{L_o} = \frac{L - L_o}{L_o} = \frac{L}{L_o} - 1 
\]

### Step 2: Define the True Strain
True strain \( \epsilon \) is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the instantaneous length to the original length:
\[ 
\epsilon = \ln \left(\frac{L}{L_o}\right) 
\]

### Step 3: Relate True Strain to Engineering Strain
From the definition of engineering strain in Step 1:
\[ 
\frac{L}{L_o} = 1 + e 
\]
Substitute this expression into the equation for true strain:
\[ 
\epsilon = \ln \left( \frac{L}{L_o} \right) = \ln(1 + e) 
\]

### Conclusion
This derivation shows that the true strain \( \epsilon \) is indeed given by the formula:
\[ 
\epsilon = \ln(1 + e) 
\]

This relationship signifies that true strain accounts for the continuous change in length, integrating the incremental changes in strain, which makes it more accurate at large deformations compared to engineering strain.","In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the

previous curve, a downturn ﬁ  nally occurs as a result of necking. A dashed line is used  in the ﬁ  gure to indicate the projected continuation of the true stress–strain plot if  necking had not occurred.  

As strain becomes signiﬁ  cant in the plastic region, the values of true strain and  engineering strain diverge. True strain can be related to the corresponding engineer- ing strain by  

$$
\epsilon=\ln(1+e)
$$  

Similarly, true stress and engineering stress can be related by the expression  

$$
\sigma=s\,(1\,+\,e)
$$  

In Figure 3.4, note that stress increases continuously in the plastic region until  necking begins. When this happened in the engineering stress–strain curve, its sig- niﬁ  cance was lost because an admittedly erroneous area value was used to calculate  stress. Now when the true stress also increases, it cannot be dismissed so lightly.  What it means is that the metal is becoming stronger as strain increases. This is the  property called  strain hardening  that was mentioned in the previous chapter in the  discussion of metallic crystal structures, and it is a property that most metals exhibit  to a greater or lesser degree.  

# Example 3.2  True stress and  strain  

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine (a) true stress and (b) true strain  at the maximum load of  $65{,}000\:\mathrm{N}.$ .  

Solution:  (a) True stress is deﬁ  ned as the load divided by the instantaneous  area. To ﬁ  nd the instantaneous area, we assume uniform elongation prior to  necking. Thus, $A L=A_{o}L_{o}$ , and $A=A_{o}L_{o}/L=200(50)/57.7=173.3\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}/$  

$$
{\sigma=F/A=65,\!000/173.3=375\;\mathrm{MPa}}
$$  

(b) By Equation (3.7), true strain $\epsilon=\ln(L/L_{o})=\ln(57.7/50)=$ $\ln(1.154)={\bf0.143}$ .  

Check:  Use Equations (3.8) and (3.9) to check these values:  

Using Equation (3.8) and the value of  $e$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\epsilon=\ln(1+0.154)=0.143$ .  

Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.  

! (1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ .  

Solving for $n$  and $K$ ,  

(1) $K=160/(0.001998)^{n}$  and (2) $K=375/(0.143)^{n}$   $160/(0.001998)^{n}=375/(0.143)^{n}$  

 $\ln(160)-n\ln(0.001998)=\ln(375)-n\ln(0.143$  ln(0.143)

 $5.0752-(-6.2156)n=5.9269-(-1.9449)n

Check:  Using (2):  $K=375/(0.143)^{0.1994}=552.7.$  

The ﬂ  ow curve equation is $\sigma={\tt552.7}\epsilon^{\tt0.1994}$ .  

Necking in a tensile test and in metal forming operations that stretch the work  part is closely related to strain hardening. As the test specimen is elongated during  the initial part of the test (before necking begins), uniform straining occurs through- out the length because if any element in the specimen becomes strained more than  the surrounding metal, its strength increases by work hardening, thus making it  more resistant to additional strain until the surrounding metal has been strained  an equal amount. Finally, the strain becomes so large that uniform straining cannot  be sustained. A weak point in the length develops (from buildup of dislocations at  grain boundaries, impurities in the metal, or other factors), and necking is initiated,  leading to failure. Empirical evidence reveals that necking begins for a particular  metal when the true strain reaches a value equal to the strain-hardening exponent $n$ .  Therefore, a higher $n$  value means that the metal can be strained further before the  onset of necking during tensile loading.  

Types of Stress–Strain Relationships  Much information about elastic–plastic  behavior is provided by the true stress–strain curve. As indicated, Hooke’s law  ( $\mathit{(\sigma=E\epsilon)}$ ) governs the metal’s behavior in the elastic region, and the ﬂ  ow curve

A copper wire of diameter 0.80 mm fails at an engineering stress = 248.2 MPa. Its ductility is measured as 75% reduction of area.

However, it should be noted that these values are associated with the necked portion of the test specimen.","To determine the true stress and true strain at failure for the copper wire, we'll follow these steps:

### Given:
- Diameter of the wire = \(0.80\, \text{mm}\)
- Engineering stress at failure = \(248.2\, \text{MPa}\)
- Reduction of area = \(75\%\)

### Calculations:

#### Step 1: Calculate the original area (\(A_o\))
The area of a circle is given by:
\[ A = \frac{\pi}{4} \times \text{diameter}^2 \]
\[ A_o = \frac{\pi}{4} \times (0.80)^2 = 0.502\, \text{mm}^2 \]

#### Step 2: Calculate the final area (\(A_f\)) after reduction
\[ A_f = A_o \times (1 - \text{reduction}) \]
\[ A_f = 0.502 \times (1 - 0.75) = 0.1255\, \text{mm}^2 \]

#### Step 3: Calculate the true stress (\(\sigma_t\))
True stress is calculated using the final area:
\[ \sigma_t = \frac{\text{Force}}{A_f} = \text{Engineering Stress} \times \frac{A_o}{A_f} \]
\[ \sigma_t = 248.2 \times \frac{0.502}{0.1255} = 993.15\, \text{MPa} \]

#### Step 4: Calculate the true strain (\(\epsilon_t\))
True strain is given by:
\[ \epsilon_t = \ln \left( \frac{A_o}{A_f} \right) \]
\[ \epsilon_t = \ln \left( \frac{0.502}{0.1255} \right) = 1.386 \]

### Final Answer:
- **True Stress at Failure:** \(993.15\, \text{MPa}\)
- **True Strain at Failure:** \(1.386 \)","During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ .

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the  

! To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ .

### Given:
- Original gage length, \(L_0 = 2.0 \, \text{in}\)
- Cross-sectional area, \(A_0 = 0.5 \, \text{in}^2\)
- Maximum load, \(F = 37,000 \, \text{lb}\)
- Engineering elongation percentage at maximum load = 24%

### Steps:

#### (1) Engineering Strain
Engineering strain (\(e\)) is calculated using the formula:

\[ e = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0} \]

where \( \Delta L \) is the change in length. Given the elongation percentage:

\[ e = \frac{24}{100} = 0.24 \]

#### (2) True Stress
The true stress (\(\sigma\)) is calculated using the formula:

\[ \sigma = \frac{F}{A} \]

In terms of engineering stress, true stress is \( \sigma = \text{engineering stress} \times (1 + e) \).

First, calculate engineering stress (\(s\)):

\[ s = \frac{F}{A_0} = \frac{37,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} = 74,000 \, \text{psi} \]

Now, calculate the true stress:

\[ \sigma = 74,000 \, \text{psi} \times (1 + 0.24) = 74,000 \, \text{psi} \times 1.24 = 91,760 \, \text{psi} \]

#### (3) True Strain
True strain (\(\epsilon\)) is calculated using the formula:

\[ \epsilon = \ln(1 + e) \]

Substitute the engineering strain:

\[ \epsilon = \ln(1 + 0.24) \]

\[ \epsilon = \ln(1.24) \]

\[ \epsilon \approx 0.215 \]

### Conclusion:
- **True Stress** at maximum load: \(91,760 \, \text{psi}\)
- **True Strain** at maximum load: \(0.215\)

We'll follow the engineering stress-strain relationship and assume uniform deformation without any barreling effects, which is a common assumption for basic calculations.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Compute the Initial Volume of the Specimen
Since the volume remains constant during plastic deformation, we first calculate the initial volume and use it to find the cross-sectional area at a compressed height.

- **Initial height (H₀) = 62.5 mm**
- **Initial diameter (D₀) = 25 mm**
  
\[ V_0 = A_0 \cdot H_0 \]
Where:
- \( A_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \times D_0^2 \)
- \( A_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \times (25)^2 = 490.87 \, \text{mm}^2 \)

Calculate the initial volume, \( V_0 \):
  
\[ V_0 = 490.87 \, \text{mm}^2 \times 62.5 \, \text{mm} = 30,679.38 \, \text{mm}^3 \]

#### Step 2: Determine the Cross-Sectional Area at Compressed Height
Use the volume conservation principle:

- **Compressed height (H₁) = 50 mm**

Since volume is conserved:
\[ V_0 = V_1 \]
\[ A_0 \cdot H_0 = A_1 \cdot H_1 \]
  
Solve for the new area, \( A_1 \):

\[ A_1 = \frac{V_0}{H_1} = \frac{30,679.38}{50} = 613.59 \, \text{mm}^2 \]

#### Step 3: Calculate True Strain
True strain (\(\epsilon\)) is given by:

\[ \epsilon = \ln \left(\frac{H_0}{H_1}\right) = \ln \left(\frac{62.5}{50}\right) = \ln (1.25) \]

Calculate \(\ln (1.25)\):

\[ \epsilon \approx 0.22314 \]

#### Step 4: Calculate Flow Stress Using Flow Curve Equation
The flow stress (\(\sigma\)) can be calculated using the flow curve equation:

\[ \sigma = K \cdot \epsilon^n \]

Where:
- \( K = 620.5 \, \text{MPa} \) (strength coefficient)
- \( n = 0.26 \) (strain-hardening exponent)
  
Substitute the values:

\[ \sigma = 620.5 \times 0.22314^{0.26} \]

Calculate \( \sigma \):

\[ \sigma \approx 620.5 \times 0.7425 \approx 460.54 \, \text{MPa} \]

#### Step 5: Calculate Load Required
Finally, calculate the load (F) using the cross-sectional area at compressed height:

\[ F = \sigma \cdot A_1 \]
\[ F = 460.54 \, \text{MPa} \times 613.59 \, \text{mm}^2 \]

Convert MPa to N (since 1 MPa = 1 N/mm²):

\[ F = 460.54 \times 613.59 = 282,530.29 \, \text{N} \]

   - Final height \(h_f = 37.5 \text{ mm}\).
   - True strain \(\epsilon\) in compression is given by \(\epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{h_i}{h_f}\right)\).

   Calculate \(\epsilon\):
   \[
   \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{62.5}{37.5}\right) = \ln(1.6667) \approx 0.5108
   \]

3. **Calculate the True Stress Using the Flow Curve:**
   - Substitute the strain (\(\epsilon = 0.5108\)) into the flow curve equation to find the true stress \(\sigma\):
   \[
   \sigma = K \cdot \epsilon^n = 620.5 \cdot (0.5108)^{0.26}
   \]
   - Calculate the value:
     \[
     \sigma = 620.5 \cdot 0.7885 \approx 489.14 \text{ MPa}
     \]

4. **Determine the Final Cross-Sectional Area:**
   - By the assumption of uniform cross-sectional area increase and volume constancy:
     - Initial volume \(V_i = A_i \cdot h_i\)
     - Final volume \(V_f = A_f \cdot h_f\), and \(V_i = V_f\).

   - Initial area \(A_i = \frac{\pi}{4} \cdot d^2\), where \(d = 25 \text{ mm}\).
     \[
     A_i = \frac{\pi}{4} \cdot (25)^2 \approx 490.87 \text{ mm}^2
     \]

   - Use volume conservation to find final area \(A_f\):
   \[
   A_f = \frac{V_i}{h_f} = \frac{A_i \cdot h_i}{h_f} = \frac{490.87 \cdot 62.5}{37.5}
   \]

   - Calculate:
     \[
     A_f \approx \frac{30679.375}{37.5} \approx 818.12 \text{ mm}^2
     \]

5. **Calculate the Required Load:**
   - Load \(F\) is given by the stress-area relationship:
     \[
     F = \sigma \cdot A_f
     \]

   - Substitute the values to calculate \(F\):
     \[
     F = 489.14 \, \text{MPa} \cdot 818.12 \, \text{mm}^2
     \]
     \[
     F = 0.48914 \, \text{kN/mm}^2 \cdot 818.12 \, \text{mm}^2 \approx 400.53 \, \text{kN}
     \]

So, the load required to compress the specimen to a height of 37.5 mm is approximately 400.53 kN.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.18
"A steel test specimen (modulus of elasticity = 30 x 106 lb/in2) in a compression test has a starting height = 2.0 in and diameter = 1.5 in. The metal yields (0.2% offset) at a load = 140,000 lb.

Ao = Do/4 = (1.5)^2/4 = 1.767 in2 Y = 140,000/1.767 = 79,224 lb/in2","To solve the problem, our main goal is to determine the yield strength of the steel test specimen. Here’s a step-by-step calculation:

### Given Data:
- **Modulus of Elasticity (E):** \(30 \times 10^6 \, \text{lb/in}^2\)
- **Initial Height (h_0):** 2.0 in
- **Initial Diameter (d):** 1.5 in
- **Load at Yield (F_y):** 140,000 lb
- **Load at Reduction (F):** 260,000 lb
- **Height after Load (h):** 1.6 in

### Steps to Solve for the Yield Strength:

**1. Determine the Cross-Sectional Area (A) of the Specimen:**

The cross-sectional area of a cylindrical specimen is calculated using the formula for the area of a circle \( A = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 \).

\[
A = \pi \left(\frac{1.5}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \times 0.75^2 = \pi \times 0.5625 \approx 1.767 \, \text{in}^2
\]

**2. Calculate the Yield Strength (\(\sigma_y\)) of the Material:**

Yield strength is the stress at which material begins to deform plastically. It's calculated using the formula:

\[
\sigma_y = \frac{F_y}{A}
\]

Where \( F_y \) is the yield load and \( A \) is the cross-sectional area calculated above.

\[
\sigma_y = \frac{140,000 \, \text{lb}}{1.767 \, \text{in}^2} \approx 79,237.38 \, \text{lb/in}^2
\]

Thus, the yield strength of the steel test specimen is approximately 79,237 lb/in².

### Explanation of Steps:
- **Step 1:** We calculated the cross-sectional area using the diameter given, as the stress depends on the load divided by this area.
- **Step 2:** We used the formula for stress (\(\sigma = \frac{F}{A}\)) to find the yield strength, which is the stress corresponding to the load at which the specimen yields (starts flowing plastically).

This solution assumes that the behavior of the material is purely axial and homogeneous throughout the specimen, and that the initial cylindrical shape does not deviate under load in a non-axial direction.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.2

- \( TRS = 1000 \, \text{MPa} \)
- \( F = \) applied load (what we're solving for)
- \( L = 60 \, \text{mm} \)
- \( b = 15 \, \text{mm} \)
- \( t = 10 \, \text{mm} \)

\[
F = \frac{TRS \cdot b \cdot t^2}{1.5 \cdot L}
\]

Substitute in the given values:

\[
F = \frac{1000 \cdot 15 \cdot 10^2}{1.5 \cdot 60}
\]

Calculate step-by-step:

1. Calculate \( b \cdot t^2 \):

   \[
   b \cdot t^2 = 15 \cdot 10^2 = 15 \cdot 100 = 1500
   \]

2. Calculate the numerator:

   \[
   1000 \cdot 1500 = 1500000

3. Calculate the denominator:

   \[
   1.5 \cdot 60 = 90

4. Divide the numerator by the denominator to find \( F \):

   \[
   F = \frac{1500000}{90} = 16666.67 \, \text{N}

load. These materials do not respond well to traditional tensile testing because of  problems in preparing the test specimens and possible misalignment of the press  jaws that hold the specimen. The  bending test  (also known as the  ﬂ  exure test ) is  used to test the strength of these materials, using a setup illustrated in the ﬁ  rst  diagram in Figure 3.10. In this procedure, a specimen of rectangular cross section  is positioned between two supports, and a load is applied at its center. In this con- ﬁ  guration, the test is called a three-point bending test. A four-point conﬁ  guration  is also sometimes used. These brittle materials do not ﬂ  ex to the exaggerated ex- tent shown in Figure 3.10; instead they deform elastically until immediately be- fore fracture. Failure usually occurs because the ultimate tensile strength of the  outer ﬁ  bers of the specimen has been exceeded. This results in  cleavage , a failure  mode associated with ceramics and metals operating at low service temperatures,  in which separation rather than slip occurs along certain crystallographic planes.  The strength value derived from this test is called the  transverse rupture strength ,  calculated from the formula  

$$
T R S={\frac{1.5F L}{b t^{2}}}
$$  

where  $T R S=$  transverse rupture strength, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  applied load at fracture,  N (lb); $L=$ length of the specimen between supports, mm (in); and  $b$  and  $t$  are the  dimensions of the cross section of the specimen as shown in the ﬁ  gure, mm (in).  

The ﬂ  exure test is also used for certain nonbrittle materials such as thermoplastic  polymers. In this case, because the material is likely to deform rather than fracture,  TRS cannot be determined based on failure of the specimen. Instead, either of two  measures is used: (1) the load recorded at a given level of deﬂ  ection, or (2) the de- ﬂ  ection observed at a given load.  

# 3.1.4 SHEAR PROPERTIES  

Shear involves application of stresses in opposite directions on either side of a thin  element to deﬂ  ect it as shown in Figure 3.11. The shear stress is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\tau={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

![](images/54903b7bc86140704dc9a1b301a1623b6698845dbec06069b59ac3b86084a573.jpg)  

where  $\tau=$  shear stress,  $\mathrm{lb/in^{2}}$  (MPa);  $F=$  applied force,  $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A=$  area over  which the force is applied, $\mathrm{in}^{2}\left(\mathrm{mm}^{2}\right)$ . Shear strain can be deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\gamma=\frac{\delta}{b}
$$  

where  $\gamma=$  shear strain, $\mathrm{mm/mm}\;(\mathrm{in/in});\delta=$ the deﬂ  ection of the element, mm (in);  and $b=$  the orthogonal distance over which deﬂ  ection occurs, mm (in).  

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12. As torque  is increased, the tube deﬂ  ects by twisting, which is a shear strain for this geometry. To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ .

\[

Where:
- \( F \) is the applied load at fracture = 1700 lb.
- \( L \) is the length of the specimen between supports = 2.0 in.
- \( b \) is the width of the specimen = 0.50 in.
- \( t \) is the thickness of the specimen = 0.25 in.

1. Calculate \( t^2 \):
   \[
   t^2 = (0.25)^2 = 0.0625 \, \text{in}^2

2. Substitute the values into the TRS formula:
   \[
   \text{TRS} = \frac{1.5 \times 1700 \times 2.0}{0.50 \times 0.0625}

- **Radius \( R \) = 25 mm**
- **Wall thickness \( t \) = 3 mm**
- **Gauge length \( L \) = 50 mm**
- **Torque \( T \) = 900 N-m = 900,000 N-mm**
- **Angular deflection \( \alpha \) = 0.3 radians**

### (a) Shear Stress

Substituting the given values:

- \( R = 25 \, \text{mm} \)
- \( \alpha = 0.3 \, \text{radians} \)
- \( L = 50 \, \text{mm} \)

Now calculate:

\[
\gamma = \frac{25 \times 0.3}{50}
\]

\[
\gamma = \frac{7.5}{50}

\[
\gamma = 0.15 \, \text{mm/mm}

- **Shear Stress \(\tau \approx 76.4\, \text{MPa}\)**
- **Shear Strain \(\gamma = 0.15\, \text{mm/mm}\)**

where  $G\,=$  the  shear modulus , or  shear modulus of elasticity , MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ . For  most materials, the shear modulus can be approximated by  $G=0.4E$ , where  $E$  is the  conventional elastic modulus.  

In the plastic region of the shear stress–strain curve, the material strain hardens  to cause the applied torque to continue to increase until fracture ﬁ  nally   occurs.  The relationship in this region is similar to the ﬂ  ow curve. The shear stress at  fracture can be calculated and this is used as the  shear strength $S$  of the material.  Shear strength can be estimated from tensile strength data by the approximation:  $S=0.7(T S)$ .  

Because the cross-sectional area of the test specimen in the torsion test does not  change as it does in the tensile and compression tests, the engineering stress–strain  curve for shear derived from the torsion test is virtually the same as the true stress– strain curve.  

Shear processes are common in industry. Shearing action is used to cut sheet metal  in blanking, punching, and other cutting operations (Section 19.1). In machining, the  material is removed by the mechanism of shear deformation (Section 20.2).  

The hardness of a material is deﬁ  ned as its resistance to permanent indentation.  Good hardness generally means that the material is resistant to scratching and wear.  For many engineering applications, including most of the tooling used in manufac- turing, scratch and wear resistance are important characteristics. As the reader shall  see later in this section, there is a strong correlation between hardness and strength.  

3.2.1  HARDNESS TESTS  

Hardness tests are commonly used for assessing material properties because they  are quick and convenient. However, a variety of testing methods are appropriate  because of differences in hardness among different materials. The best-known hard- ness tests are Brinell and Rockwell. During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}.

$ (b) Subtracting the $0.2\%$  offset, engineering strain  $e=(50.2-50.0)/50.0\;-

$ $0.002=0.002$ Rearranging Equation (3.3), modulus of elasticity  $E=s/e=160/0.002=$  

 $\mathbf{80,000\,M P a}$ .

 (c) Tensile strength $=$  maximum load divided by original area: 

 ${\cal T}S=65{,}000/200=325~\mathrm{M}\mathrm{Pa}$ .

 (d) By Equation (3.2), engineering strain at maximum load  $e=$  

 $(57.7-50)/50={\bf0.154}$ .

 (e) Deﬁ  ned in Equation (3.4), percent elongation $E L=(59.5-50)/50=$  

 $\mathbf{0.19}=\mathbf{19\%}$ .  

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation.

"In a torsion test, a torque of 5000 ft-lb is applied which causes an angular deflection = 1q on a thin-walled tubular specimen whose radius = 1.5 in, wall thickness = 0.10 in, and gage length = 2.0 in. Determine (a) the shear stress, (b) shear strain","Solution: (a) W = T/(2piR2t) = (5000 x 12)/(2pi(1.5)^2(0.1)) = 42,441 lb/in2. (b) J = RD/L, D = 1(2pi/360) = 0.01745 rad., J = 1.5(0.01745)/2.0 = 0.01309  ","To solve this problem, we need to determine two things: (a) the shear stress and (b) the shear strain.

### Given Data:
- Torque (T) = 5000 ft-lb
- Radius (R) = 1.5 in
- Wall thickness (t) = 0.10 in
- Gage length (L) = 2.0 in
- Angular deflection (α) = 1° = (1/360) * 2π radians = π/180 radians

### (a) Determine the Shear Stress (\(\tau\))

The formula for shear stress in a torsion test is:

\[
\tau = \frac{T}{2\pi R^2 t}
\]

First, convert the torque (T) from ft-lb to in-lb:

\[
T = 5000 \text{ ft-lb} \times 12 \text{ in/ft} = 60000 \text{ in-lb}
\]

Now substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\tau = \frac{60000}{2 \pi (1.5)^2 (0.10)}
\]

\[
\tau = \frac{60000}{2 \pi \times 2.25 \times 0.10}
\]

\[
\tau = \frac{60000}{2 \pi \times 0.225}
\]

Calculate:

\[
\tau = \frac{60000}{1.4137} \approx 42428.11 \text{ psi}
\]

### (b) Determine the Shear Strain (\(\gamma\))

The formula for shear strain is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{R\alpha}{L}
\]

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1.5 \times (\pi/180)}{2.0}
\]

Calculate:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1.5 \times 0.0174533}{2.0}
\]

\[
\gamma = \frac{0.02618}{2} \approx 0.01309 \text{ in/in}
\]

### Summary
- **Shear Stress (\(\tau\))**: \( \approx 42428.11 \) psi
- **Shear Strain (\(\gamma\))**: \( \approx 0.01309 \) in/in

These calculations provide the shear stress and strain for the given torsion test parameters.","Shear strain can be deﬁ  ned as

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12.

load. These materials do not respond well to traditional tensile testing because of  problems in preparing the test specimens and possible misalignment of the press  jaws that hold the specimen. The  bending test  (also known as the  ﬂ  exure test ) is  used to test the strength of these materials, using a setup illustrated in the ﬁ  rst  diagram in Figure 3.10. In this procedure, a specimen of rectangular cross section  is positioned between two supports, and a load is applied at its center. In this con- ﬁ  guration, the test is called a three-point bending test. A four-point conﬁ  guration  is also sometimes used. These brittle materials do not ﬂ  ex to the exaggerated ex- tent shown in Figure 3.10; instead they deform elastically until immediately be- fore fracture. Failure usually occurs because the ultimate tensile strength of the  outer ﬁ  bers of the specimen has been exceeded. This results in  cleavage , a failure  mode associated with ceramics and metals operating at low service temperatures,  in which separation rather than slip occurs along certain crystallographic planes.  The strength value derived from this test is called the  transverse rupture strength ,  calculated from the formula  

$$
T R S={\frac{1.5F L}{b t^{2}}}
$$  

where  $T R S=$  transverse rupture strength, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  applied load at fracture,  N (lb); $L=$ length of the specimen between supports, mm (in); and  $b$  and  $t$  are the  dimensions of the cross section of the specimen as shown in the ﬁ  gure, mm (in).  

The ﬂ  exure test is also used for certain nonbrittle materials such as thermoplastic  polymers. In this case, because the material is likely to deform rather than fracture,  TRS cannot be determined based on failure of the specimen. Instead, either of two  measures is used: (1) the load recorded at a given level of deﬂ  ection, or (2) the de- ﬂ  ection observed at a given load.

For a tested hardness of HB = 182, TS = 500(182) = 91,000 lb/in2.","To solve the problem, we will calculate the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN) using the standard formula for the Brinell hardness test, and then use the BHN to estimate the tensile strength of the steel specimen if it is indeed steel.

### Part (a): Determine the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN)

The formula for calculating the Brinell Hardness Number is:

\[
\text{BHN} = \frac{2P}{\pi D (D - \sqrt{D^2 - d^2})}
\]

where:
- \( P \) is the load applied (in kilograms-force, kgf).
- \( D \) is the diameter of the indenter (in millimeters, mm).
- \( d \) is the diameter of the indentation (in millimeters, mm).

Given data:
- \( P = 1500 \) kgf
- \( D = 10 \) mm
- \( d = 3.2 \) mm

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\text{BHN} = \frac{2 \times 1500}{\pi \times 10 \times (10 - \sqrt{10^2 - 3.2^2})}
\]

First, calculate \( D^2 - d^2 \):

\[
D^2 - d^2 = 10^2 - 3.2^2 = 100 - 10.24 = 89.76
\]

Now calculate \( \sqrt{D^2 - d^2} \):

\[
\sqrt{89.76} \approx 9.47
\]

Substitute back into the formula:

\[
\text{BHN} = \frac{3000}{\pi \times 10 \times (10 - 9.47)}
\]

\[
= \frac{3000}{\pi \times 10 \times 0.53}
\]

\[
= \frac{3000}{16.67}
\]

\[
\approx 179.9
\]

So, the Brinell Hardness Number is approximately 180.

### Part (b): Estimate the tensile strength of the steel

For steel, there is a known empirical relationship between Brinell Hardness Number and tensile strength:

\[
\text{Tensile Strength (TS)} \approx \text{BHN} \times 0.36 \, \text{MPa}
\]

Using the calculated BHN:

\[
\text{TS} \approx 180 \times 0.36 = 64.8 \, \text{MPa}
\]

Therefore, if the specimen is steel, the estimated tensile strength is approximately 64.8 MPa.

"One of the inspectors in the quality control department has frequently used the Brinell and Rockwell hardness tests, for which equipment is available in the company. He claims that all hardness tests are based on the same principle as the Brinell test, which is that hardness is always measured as the applied load divided by the area of the impressions made by an indentor. (a) Is he correct? (b) If not, what are some of the other principles involved in hardness testing, and what are the associated tests?","Solution: (a) No, the claim is not correct. Not all hardness tests are based on the applied load divided by area, but many of them are. (b) Some of the other hardness tests and operating principles include: (1) Rockwell hardness test, which measures the depth of indentation of a cone resulting from an applied load; (2) Scleroscope, which measures the rebound height of a hammer dropped from a certain distance against a surface specimen; and (3) Durometer, which measures elastic deformation by pressing an indentor into the surface of rubber and similar soft materials.","To determine if the inspector's claim is correct, we need to evaluate the principles behind the Brinell and Rockwell hardness tests and review other common hardness testing methods. Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding Brinell Hardness Test

1. **Principle:** The Brinell hardness test measures hardness by determining the resistance of material to indentation. It involves applying a known load (force) using a hard spherical indenter onto the test material.
   
2. **Calculation:** The Brinell hardness number (BHN) is calculated using the formula:
   
   \[
   \text{BHN} = \frac{2P}{\pi D \left( D - \sqrt{D^2 - d^2} \right)}
   \]

   Where:
   - \( P \) = applied load in kg or N
   - \( D \) = diameter of the indenter in mm
   - \( d \) = diameter of the indentation in mm

3. **Key Principle:** The hardness is evaluated as the applied load divided by the surface area of the spherical indentation.

### Step 2: Understanding Rockwell Hardness Test

1. **Principle:** The Rockwell hardness test also involves indentation, but instead of measuring the indentation diameter or area, it measures the depth of penetration under a preliminary minor load followed by a major load.

2. **Steps of the Test:** 
   - Apply a minor load to set a baseline.
   - Apply a major load to create the indentation.
   - Remove the major load while maintaining the minor load, and measure the depth of indentation.

3. **Calculation:** The Rockwell hardness number is determined by the depth of indentation and is specific to the Rockwell scale being used (e.g., Rockwell B, C).

4. **Key Principle:** Unlike the Brinell test, the Rockwell test is based on depth measurement, not area.

### Step 3: Other Hardness Testing Methods

1. **Vickers Hardness Test:**
   - **Principle:** Similar to the Brinell test, but it uses a diamond pyramid indenter.
   - **Calculation:** The Vickers hardness number (VHN) is calculated from the diagonal length of the indentation.
   - **Key Principle:** Vickers hardness is calculated using load divided by the surface area of the indentation, like Brinell.

2. **Knoop Hardness Test:**
   - **Principle:** Uses a rhombic-based pyramid indenter, suitable for very brittle materials or thin sheets.
   - **Calculation:** Hardness is determined by measuring the long diagonal of the indentation.
   - **Key Principle:** Focuses on measurement of indentation length, especially effective for micro-hardness testing.

### Step 4: Conclusion

**(a) Is the inspector correct?**
- **Answer:** No, the inspector is not entirely correct. While the Brinell hardness test involves the principle of measuring the applied load divided by the area of the impression, the Rockwell hardness test relies on measuring the depth of penetration. Thus, they are based on different principles.

**(b) Other principles involved in hardness testing:**
- **Vickers and Knoop Tests:** Use principles similar to Brinell but with different types of indenters and measurements (area/diagonal instead of depth).
- **Rockwell Test:** Measures the depth of penetration as opposed to the surface area.

These distinct methodologies demonstrate that hardness testing is not solely based on the principle of applied load divided by indentation area, as asserted by the inspector.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.26
"A batch of annealed steel has just been received from the vendor. It is supposed to have a tensile strength in the range 60,000 -70,000 lb/in2. A Brinell hardness test in the receiving department yields a value of HB = 118. (a) Does the steel meet the specification on tensile strength?","Solution: (a) TS = 500(HB) = 500(118) = 59,000 lb/in2. This lies outside the specified range of 60,000 to 70,000 lb/in2. However, from a legal standpoint, it is unlikely that the batch can be rejected on the basis of its measured Brinell hardness number without using an actual tensile test to measure TS. The formula for converting from Brinell hardness number to tensile strength is only an approximating equation. ","To determine if the steel meets the specification for tensile strength based on its Brinell hardness value, we need to use a known relationship between Brinell hardness (HB) and tensile strength for steel. A common empirical formula used to estimate tensile strength (\( \sigma \)) from Brinell hardness for steel is:

\[ \sigma = C \times HB \]

Where:
- \( \sigma \) is the tensile strength in lb/in\(^2\).
- \( HB \) is the Brinell hardness number.
- \( C \) is a constant that typically ranges between 500 and 550 for steel, depending on the specific alloy and treatment.

We'll proceed by estimating the tensile strength using a mid-range constant value, \( C = 500 \), as an initial approximation, since it's the most commonly used constant in many general applications. If we find the result too far inside or outside the desired range, we can refine our approach.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   \sigma = 500 \times 118
   \]

2. **Calculate the Tensile Strength:**
   \[
   \sigma = 59,000 \text{ lb/in}^2
   \]

3. **Compare to the Required Range (60,000 - 70,000 lb/in²):**

   The calculated tensile strength of 59,000 lb/in² is slightly below the specification range of 60,000 to 70,000 lb/in².

### Reasoning:

- The empirical relationship gives an approximation and assumes an average constant value for \( C \). Different alloys and processing conditions can shift the exact value.
- An estimation with \( C = 500 \) gives a tensile strength just below the specification from the vendor. This suggests that either a slightly higher actual constant might apply, or the batch might not strictly meet the vendor's tensile strength specification.

### Conclusion:

Using \( C = 500 \) shows that the steel does not meet the tensile strength specification. However, for precise verification, testing a sample for tensile strength directly or consulting the specific constant for the alloy could give more exact information. If precise conformity to specifications is critical, further testing or discussions with the supplier might be necessary.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.27

(b) Estimate the yield strength of the material.","Solution:  (b) Based on Table 3.2 in the text, the ratio of Y to TS for low carbon steel = 25,000/45,000 =0.555. Using this ratio, we can estimate the yield strength to be Y = 0.555(59,000) = 32,700 lb/in2.","To estimate the yield strength of the annealed steel using the Brinell hardness number (HB = 118), we can employ empirical relationships commonly used in metallurgy that relate hardness to yield strength. 

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

#### Step 1: Understand the relationship between Brinell Hardness and Yield Strength.
The yield strength (\(\sigma_y\)) of steel can be approximately estimated from the Brinell hardness number using an empirical formula:

\[
\sigma_y \approx \frac{HB}{K}
\]

where \(K\) is a constant. For steel, \(K\) typically ranges from 0.3 to 0.35, depending on the alloy and treatments.

#### Step 2: Calculate the Yield Strength.
Let's choose a common value for \(K\) as 0.3 for a conservative estimate. 

\[
\sigma_y \approx \frac{118}{0.3} \approx 393.33 \, \text{MPa}
\]

To convert this value from MPa to lb/in² (psi), we use the conversion factor: 1 MPa = 145.038 psi.

\sigma_y \approx 393.33 \times 145.038 \approx 57,053 \, \text{psi}
\]

#### Step 3: Interpretation
The estimated yield strength of the material using a Brinell hardness number of 118 is approximately 57,053 psi.

### Reasoning:

- **Relation Between Hardness and Strength:** The Brinell hardness test provides an indication of the material's resistance to deformation, which correlates to its yield strength. This empirical relationship helps quickly estimate mechanical properties without extensive tensile testing.
  
- **Unit Conversion:** Since material property standards often use psi (pounds per square inch) in the United States, converting from MPa provides meaningful data that can be directly compared with specified tensile strength ranges.

This calculated yield strength (approximately 57,053 psi) is below the 60,000 - 70,000 psi range specified. This could indicate a discrepancy, and it might be essential to verify the material specifications with the supplier or conduct further tests for compliance.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.27
"Two flat plates, separated by a space of 4 mm, are moving relative to each other at a velocity of 5 m/sec. The space between them is occupied by a fluid of unknown viscosity. The motion of the plates is resisted by a shear stress of 10 Pa due to the viscosity of the fluid. Assuming that the velocity gradient of the fluid is constant, determine the coefficient of viscosity of the fluid.",Solution: Shear rate = (5 m/s x 1000 mm/m)/(4 mm) = 1250 s-1 K = (10N/m2)/(1250 s-1) = 0.008 N-s/m2 = 0.008 Pa-s,"In manufacturing processes, understanding fluid dynamics is crucial, especially when dealing with lubrication in moving parts. In this scenario, you have two plates with a fluid in between, and you want to find the coefficient of viscosity of the fluid based on the given shear stress and plate movement.

Here's how you can calculate the viscosity step by step:

**Step 1: Understand the Relationship**
- The shear stress (\(\tau\)) in a fluid is related to the fluid's viscosity (\(\eta\)) and the velocity gradient (\(\frac{dv}{dy}\)) according to Newton's law of viscosity:
  \[
  \tau = \eta \times \frac{dv}{dy}
  \]

**Step 2: Identify Given Values**
- Shear stress (\(\tau\)): \(10 \, \text{Pa}\)
- Velocity of the plates (\(v\)): \(5 \, \text{m/s}\)
- Distance between the plates (\(y\)): \(4 \, \text{mm}\) or \(0.004 \, \text{m}\)

**Step 3: Calculate the Velocity Gradient**
- The velocity gradient is the change in velocity (\(dv\)) over distance (\(dy\)):
  \[
  \frac{dv}{dy} = \frac{5 \, \text{m/s}}{0.004 \, \text{m}} = 1250 \, \text{s}^{-1}
  \]

**Step 4: Solve for the Coefficient of Viscosity (\(\eta\))**
- Use the relationship from Step 1:
  \[
  \eta = \frac{\tau}{\frac{dv}{dy}} = \frac{10 \, \text{Pa}}{1250 \, \text{s}^{-1}}
  \]

- Calculate \(\eta\):
  \[
  \eta = 0.008 \, \text{Pa}\cdot\text{s}
  \]

**Conclusion**
- The coefficient of viscosity of the fluid is \(0.008 \, \text{Pa}\cdot\text{s}\).

In summary, by applying the fundamental principle of shear stress in fluids and using the given measurements, we determined that the fluid's resistance to flow translates to a viscosity of \(0.008 \, \text{Pa}\cdot\text{s}\).

"Two parallel surfaces, separated by a space of 0.5 in that is occupied by a fluid, are moving relative to each other at a velocity of 25 in/sec. The motion is resisted by a shear stress of 0.3 lb/in2 due to the viscosity of the fluid. If the velocity gradient in the space between the surfaces is constant, determine the viscosity of the fluid.",Solution: Shear rate = (25 in/sec)/(0.5 in) = 50 sec-1 K = (0.3 lb/in2)/(50 sec-1) = 0.0006 lb-sec/in2.,"To determine the viscosity of the fluid, we need to apply the fundamental relationship between shear stress, shear rate, and viscosity in fluids. This relationship is given by Newton's law of viscosity:

\[ \tau = \mu \cdot \left( \frac{du}{dy} \right) \]

where:
- \(\tau\) is the shear stress (lb/in\(^2\)),
- \(\mu\) is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (lb·s/in\(^2\)),
- \(\frac{du}{dy}\) is the velocity gradient (s\(^{-1}\)), also known as the shear rate.

We are provided with:
- \(\tau = 0.3\) lb/in\(^2\),
- A space separation of 0.5 inches,
- A relative velocity (\(u\)) of 25 in/sec between the two surfaces.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Identify the known parameters:**
    - Shear stress, \(\tau = 0.3\) lb/in\(^2\)
    - Separation between surfaces, \(dy = 0.5\) in
    - Velocity difference, \(du = 25\) in/sec

2. **Calculate the velocity gradient (\(\frac{du}{dy}\)):**
   - Since the velocity gradient is assumed to be uniform, the velocity gradient is simply the change in velocity divided by the separation distance:
   \[
   \frac{du}{dy} = \frac{25 \text{ in/sec}}{0.5 \text{ in}} = 50 \text{ s}^{-1}
   \]

3. **Use Newton's law of viscosity to find the viscosity (\(\mu\)):**
   - Rearrange the formula to solve for viscosity, \(\mu\):
   \[
   \mu = \frac{\tau}{\frac{du}{dy}}
   \]
   - Substitute in the known values:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{0.3 \text{ lb/in}^2}{50 \text{ s}^{-1}}
   \]
   - Calculate \(\mu\):
   \[
   \mu = 0.006 \text{ lb·s/in}^2
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The dynamic viscosity of the fluid is \(0.006 \text{ lb·s/in}^2\).

A 125.0-mm-diameter shaft rotates inside a stationary bushing whose inside diameter = 125.6 mm and length = 50.0 mm. In the clearance between the shaft and the bushing is a lubricating oil whose viscosity = 0.14 Pa-s. The shaft rotates at a velocity of 400 rev/min; this speed and the action of the oil are sufficient to keep the shaft centered inside the bushing. Determine the magnitude of the torque due to viscosity that acts to resist the rotation of the shaft.,Solution: Bushing internal bearing area A = (125.6)^2 x 50/4 = 19729.6 mm2 = 19729.2(10^-6) m2 d = (125.6 -125)/2 = 0.3 mm v = (125pi mm/rev)(400 rev/min)(1 min/60 sec) = 2618.0 mm/s Shear rate = 2618/0.3 = 8726.6 s-1     W = (0.14)(8726.6) = 1221.7 Pa = 1221.7 N/mm2 Force on surface between shaft and bushing = (1221.7 N/mm2)(19729.2(10^-6)) = 24.1 N Torque T = 24.1 N x 125/2 mm = 1506.4 N-mm = 1.506 N-m,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the torque due to the viscosity of the lubricating oil acting on the rotating shaft. First, we’ll establish and use the appropriate formulas from fluid mechanics and engineering principles. Here are the steps:

### Step 1: Identify Known Values

1. **Shaft Diameter (\(D_s\))** = 125.0 mm = 0.125 m
2. **Bushing Inside Diameter (\(D_b\))** = 125.6 mm = 0.1256 m
3. **Clearance (c)** = \( \frac{D_b - D_s}{2} \) = \( \frac{0.1256 \text{ m} - 0.125 \text{ m}}{2} \) = 0.0003 m
4. **Length of Bushing (L)** = 50.0 mm = 0.050 m
5. **Viscosity of Oil (\(\mu\))** = 0.14 Pa·s
6. **Rotational Speed of Shaft (N)** = 400 rev/min

### Step 2: Convert Rotational Speed to Angular Velocity

Convert the rotational speed from revolutions per minute to radians per second:

\[
\omega = 2\pi \times \frac{N}{60}
\]
\[
\omega = 2\pi \times \frac{400}{60} = \frac{800\pi}{60} = \frac{40\pi}{3} \approx 41.89 \text{ rad/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Shear Rate

For a thin film of oil, the shear rate (\(\dot{\gamma}\)) is approximated by:

\[
\dot{\gamma} = \frac{\text{Relative velocity}}{\text{Gap width}} = \frac{\omega \times \left(\frac{D_s}{2}\right)}{c}
\]

\[
\dot{\gamma} = \frac{41.89 \times 0.0625}{0.0003} = \frac{2.6181}{0.0003} = 8727 \text{ s}^{-1}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Shear Stress

Shear stress (\(\tau\)) can be calculated using viscosity and shear rate:

\[
\tau = \mu \times \dot{\gamma}
\]

\[
\tau = 0.14 \times 8727 = 1221.78 \text{ Pa}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Torque

The resistance torque (\(T\)) due to shear stress acting over the bushing area:

\[
T = \tau \times A \times \left(\frac{D_s}{2}\right)
\]

Where \(A\) is the surface area of the bushing the oil is in contact with:

\[
A = \pi \times D_s \times L = \pi \times 0.125 \times 0.050 = 0.01963495 \text{ m}^2
\]

Thus, the torque (\(T\)) is:

\[
T = 1221.78 \times 0.01963495 \times 0.0625 
\]

\[
T = 1221.78 \times 0.00122718 = 1.498 \, \text{Nm}
\]

### Conclusion

The magnitude of the torque due to the viscosity that acts to resist the rotation of the shaft is approximately \(1.498 \, \text{Nm}\).",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.3

The reduction in diameter is caused by thermal contraction, which can be calculated using the concept of linear thermal expansion. Unfortunately, since Table 4.1 was not provided, I'll describe the general steps involved in solving this type of problem, assuming relevant material properties such as the coefficient of linear expansion are available.

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Understand the Expansion/Contraction Formula:**
   The formula for linear thermal expansion or contraction is:
   \[
   \Delta L = \alpha \times L_0 \times \Delta T
   \]
   Where:
   - \(\Delta L\) is the change in length (in this case, the change in diameter).
   - \(\alpha\) is the coefficient of linear expansion for the material of the shaft.
   - \(L_0\) is the original length (or diameter in this scenario) of the material.
   - \(\Delta T\) is the change in temperature.

2. **Identify Known Values:**
   - Initial diameter (\(L_0\)): 25.00 mm
   - Final diameter: 24.98 mm
   - Change in diameter (\(\Delta L\)): 25.00 mm - 24.98 mm = 0.02 mm
   - Room temperature: \(20^\circ C\)

3. **Determine the Coefficient of Linear Expansion:**
   Assuming Table 4.1 provides \(\alpha\), let’s denote it as \(\alpha\). As I don't have the specific values, typically steel has a \(\alpha\) value around \(11 \times 10^{-6} \text{per } ^\circ C\).

4. **Rearrange the Formula:**
   Rearrange the linear expansion formula to solve for \(\Delta T\):
   \[
   \Delta T = \frac{\Delta L}{\alpha \times L_0}
   \]

5. **Calculate \(\Delta T\):**
   Substitute the known values (assuming \(\alpha = 11 \times 10^{-6} \text{per } ^\circ C\)) into the equation:
   \[
   \Delta T = \frac{0.02 \text{ mm}}{11 \times 10^{-6} \text{ /}^\circ C \times 25.00 \text{ mm}}
   \]

6. **Perform the Calculation:**
   \[
   \Delta T = \frac{0.02}{11 \times 10^{-6} \times 25} = \frac{0.02}{0.000275} \approx 72.73^\circ C
   \]
   This result reflects the necessary change in temperature.

7. **Determine Final Temperature:**
   Since the initial temperature is \(20^\circ C\), the final temperature would be:
   \[
   \text{Final Temperature} = 20^\circ C - 72.73^\circ C = -52.73^\circ C
   \]

### Conclusion:
The shaft needs to be cooled to approximately \(-52.73^\circ C\) to achieve a diameter reduction from 25.00 mm to 24.98 mm.

"Aluminum has a density of 2.70 g/cm3 at room temperature (20C). Determine its density at 650C, using data in Table 4.1 as a reference.","Solution: Assume a 1 cm3 cube, 1 cm on each side. From Table 4.1, a = 24(10^-6) mm/mm/C L2-L1=a L1(T2-T2). L2 = 1.0 + 24(10^-6)(1.0)(650 -20) = 1.01512 cm (L2 )^3 = (1.01512)^3 = 1.04605 cm3 Assume weight remains the same; thus U at 650C = 2.70/1.04605 = 2.581 g/cm3","To determine the density of aluminum at 650°C, we need to take into account the effect of thermal expansion on density.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

**Step 1: Understand the Initial Parameters**

- **Initial Density (\(\rho_0\))**: The density of aluminum at room temperature (20°C) is given as 2.70 g/cm³.
- **Initial Temperature (T₀)**: 20°C.
- **Final Temperature (T_f)**: 650°C.

**Step 2: Coefficient of Linear Expansion**

While not specifically provided in the given data, aluminum's coefficient of linear expansion (\(\alpha\)) is approximately \(23.1 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C^{-1}}\).

**Step 3: Calculate the Volume Expansion**

The volumetric expansion can be calculated assuming isotropic expansion, given by:

\[
\Delta V/V_0 = 3\alpha \Delta T
\]

Where:
- \(\Delta V\) is the change in volume.
- \(V_0\) is the initial volume.
- \(\Delta T\) is the temperature change (\(T_f - T_0\)) = \(650^\circ C - 20^\circ C = 630^\circ C\).

**Step 4: Calculate Change in Volume**

Plugging in the values:

\[
\Delta V/V_0 = 3 \times 23.1 \times 10^{-6} \times 630 = 0.043587
\]

This means the volume increases by approximately 4.36%.

**Step 5: Calculate the New Density**

Since density is inversely proportional to volume, we use:

\[
\rho_f = \rho_0 / (1 + \Delta V/V_0)
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
\rho_f = 2.70 \, \text{g/cm}^3 / (1 + 0.043587)
\]

\[
\rho_f = 2.70 \, \text{g/cm}^3 / 1.043587 \approx 2.59 \, \text{g/cm}^3
\]

### Conclusion

The density of aluminum at 650°C is approximately \(2.59 \, \text{g/cm}^3\). This reduction in density is a result of thermal expansion which increases the volume.","# TABLE  •  6.1   (continued): (f) Titanium.

as an ore because of its higher Ti content. In recovery of the metal from its ores, the  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  is converted to titanium tetrachloride  $\mathrm{(TiCl_{4})}$  by reacting the compound with  chlorine gas. This is followed by a sequence of distillation steps to remove impurities.  The  highly concentrated  $\mathrm{TiCl_{4}}$  is then reduced to metallic titanium by reaction with  magnesium; this is known as the  Kroll process . Sodium can also be used as a reduc-  ing agent. In either case, an inert atmosphere must be maintained to prevent $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ , $\mathbf{N}_{2}$ ,  or $\mathrm{H}_{2}$  from contaminating the Ti, owing to its chemical affinity for these gases. The  resulting metal is used to cast ingots of titanium and its alloys.  

Properties of Titanium  Ti’s coefficient of thermal expansion is relatively low  among metals. It is stiffer and stronger than aluminum, and it retains good strength  at elevated temperatures. Pure titanium is reactive, which presents problems in  processing, especially in the molten state. However, at room temperature it forms  a thin adherent oxide coating $\left(\mathrm{TiO}_{2}\right)$  that provides excellent corrosion resistance.  

These properties give rise to two principal application areas for titanium: (1) in  the commercially pure state, Ti is used for corrosion resistant components, such as  marine components and prosthetic implants; and (2) titanium alloys are used as  high-strength components in temperatures ranging from ambient to above  $550^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ $(1000^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ), especially where its excellent strength-to-weight ratio is exploited.

\[
L_{2} - L_{1} = \alpha L_{1} (T_{2} - T_{1})
\]

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Identify the given values:**
   - Initial length of the steel bar, \(L_{1} = 10.0 \, \text{inches}\)
   - Initial temperature, \(T_{1} = 70^\circ \text{F}\)
   - Final temperature, \(T_{2} = 500^\circ \text{F}\)
   - Coefficient of thermal expansion for steel, \(\alpha = 6.4 \times 10^{-6}\, \text{in/in}^\circ \text{F}\) (this value is typical for steel; please verify with Table 4.1).

2. **Calculate the temperature change:**

   \[
   \Delta T = T_{2} - T_{1} = 500^\circ \text{F} - 70^\circ \text{F} = 430^\circ \text{F}

3. **Substitute the values into the formula:**

   \[
   L_{2} - L_{1} = \alpha L_{1} \Delta T
   = (6.4 \times 10^{-6}\, \text{in/in}^\circ \text{F}) \times 10.0 \, \text{inches} \times 430^\circ \text{F}

   L_{2} - L_{1} = (6.4 \times 10^{-6}) \times 10 \times 430
   = 0.02752 \, \text{inches}
   \]

### Conclusion:

The increase in length of the steel bar when heated from 70°F to 500°F is approximately 0.02752 inches.","The change in  length corresponding to a given temperature change is given by:  

$$
L_{2}-L_{1}=a L_{1}\left(T_{2}-T_{1}\right)
$$  

where $a=$   coefficient of thermal expansion, $^{\circ}\mathbf{C}^{\cdot1}(^{\circ}\mathbf{F}^{\cdot1})$ ; and $L_{1}$  and $L_{2}$  are lengths,  mm (in), corresponding, respectively, to temperatures $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2},\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\ (^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ .  

Values of coefficient of thermal expansion given in Table 4.1 suggest that it has  a linear relationship with temperature. This is only an approximation. Not only is  length affected by temperature, but the thermal expansion coefficient itself is also  affected. For some materials it increases with temperature; for other materials it  decreases. These changes are usually not significant enough to be of much concern,  and values like those in the table are quite useful in design calculations for the range  of temperatures contemplated in service. Changes in the coefficient are more sub-  stantial when the metal undergoes a phase transformation, such as from solid to  liquid, or from one crystal structure to another.  

In manufacturing operations, thermal expansion is put to good use in shrink fit  and expansion fit assemblies (Section 31.3), in which a part is heated to increase its  size or cooled to decrease its size to permit insertion into some other part. When the  part returns to ambient temperature, a tightly fitted assembly is obtained. Thermal  expansion can be a problem in heat treatment (Chapter 26) and welding (Section  29.6) because of thermal stresses that develop in the material during these processes.  

# 4.1.3  MELTING  CHARACTERISTICS  

For a pure element, the  melting point $T_{m}$   is the temperature at which the mate- rial  transforms from solid to liquid state. The reverse transformation, from liquid to  solid,  occurs at the same temperature and is called the  freezing point . For crystalline  elements,  such as metals, the melting and freezing temperatures are the same. A cer- tain  amount of heat energy, called the  heat of fusion , is required at this temperature to  accomplish the transformation from solid to liquid.  

Melting of a metal element at a specific temperature assumes equilibrium condi-  tions. Exceptions occur in nature; for example, when a molten metal is cooled, it may  remain in the liquid state below its freezing point if nucleation of crystals does not  initiate immediately. When this happens, the liquid is said to be  supercooled .  

There are other variations in the melting process—differences in the way melt-  ing occurs in different materials. For example, unlike pure metals, most metal alloys  do not have a single melting point. Instead, melting begins at a certain temperature,   called the  solidus , and continues as   the temperature increases until finally convert-  ing completely to the liquid state at a temperature called the  liquidus . Between the  two temperatures, the alloy is a mixture of solid and molten metals, the amounts of  each being inversely proportional to their relative distances from the liquidus and  solidus. Although most alloys behave in this way, exceptions are eutectic alloys that

melt (and freeze) at a single temperature. These issues are examined in the discus-  sion of phase diagrams in Chapter 6.  

Another difference in melting occurs with noncrystalline materials (glasses). In  these materials, there is a gradual transition from solid to liquid states. The solid  material gradually softens as temperature increases, finally becoming liquid at the  melting point. During softening, the material has a consistency of increasing plasticity  (increasingly like a fluid) as it gets closer to the melting point.  

These differences in melting characteristics among pure metals, alloys, and glass  are portrayed in Figure 4.1. These assembly methods are used to ﬁ  t gears, pulleys, sleeves,  and other components onto solid and hollow shafts.  

Various methods are used to heat and/or cool the work parts. Heating equip- ment includes torches, furnaces, electric resistance heaters, and electric induction  heaters. Cooling methods include conventional refrigeration, packing in dry ice,  and immersion in cold liquids, including liquid nitrogen. The resulting change in  diameter depends on the coefﬁ  cient of thermal expansion and the temperature  difference that is applied to the part. If it is assumed that the heating or cooling  has produced a uniform temperature throughout the work, then the change in di- ameter is given by  

$$
D_{2}\!-\!D_{1}=\alpha\,D_{1}(T_{2}\!-\!T_{1})
$$  

where $\alpha=$  the coefﬁ  cient of linear thermal expansion, $\mathrm{mm/mm\cdot^{\circ}C}$  (in/in- $\mathrm{\cdot^{\circ}F}$ ) for the  material (see Table 4.1);  $T_{2}=$  the temperature to which the parts have been heated  or cooled, $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $\mathrm{(^{\circ}F)}$ ;  $T_{1}=$  starting ambient temperature;  $D_{2}=$  diameter of the part at  $T_{2},\mathrm{mm}$ $D_{\scriptscriptstyle1}=$  diameter of the part at  $T_{1}$ .  

Equations (31.5) through (31.9) for computing interference pressures and  effective stresses can be used to determine the corresponding values for shrink and  expansion ﬁ  ts.  

# Example 31.2  Expansion ﬁ  t  

An alloy steel shaft is to be inserted into a collar of the same metal using an  expansion ﬁ  t. At room temperature  $(20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ , the outer and inner diameters  of the collar $=50.00\:\mathrm{mm}$  and  $30.00\:\mathrm{mm}$ , respectively, and the shaft has a  diameter  $=30.015\:\mathrm{mm}$ . The shaft must be reduced in size for assembly into  the collar by cooling to a sufﬁ  ciently low temperature that there is a  clearance of  $0.03\;\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) the temperature to which the shaft  must be cooled for assembly, (b) the radial pressure at room temperature  after assembly, and (c) the maximum effective stress on the collar.

" With reference to Table 4.2, determine the quantity of heat required to increase the temperature of an

)(2.70 g/cm3
)(300qC - 21C) = 158,193 cal.
Conversion: 1.0 cal = 4.184J, so heat = 662,196 J.","To determine the quantity of heat required to increase the temperature of an aluminum block from room temperature (21°C) to 300°C, we will utilize the formula for calculating heat required for a temperature change without phase change:

\[ 
Q = m \cdot C \cdot \Delta T 
\]

where:
- \( Q \) is the heat energy required in Joules (J).
- \( m \) is the mass of the substance in grams (g).
- \( C \) is the specific heat capacity of the substance in J/g°C.
- \( \Delta T \) is the change in temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Aluminum Block

Given that the aluminum block has dimensions of 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, its volume is:

\[ 
V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} = 10 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} = 1000 \, \text{cm}^3 
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Density of Aluminum

The density of aluminum (\(\rho\)) is generally about 2.7 g/cm³.

### Step 3: Calculate the Mass of the Aluminum Block

Using the density, calculate the mass of the block:

\[ 
m = \rho \times V = 2.7 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \times 1000 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2700 \, \text{g} 
\]

### Step 4: Specific Heat Capacity of Aluminum

The specific heat capacity (\(C\)) for aluminum is approximately 0.897 J/g°C.

### Step 5: Calculate the Temperature Change

The change in temperature (\(\Delta T\)) is from 21°C to 300°C:

\[ 
\Delta T = 300°C - 21°C = 279°C 
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the Heat Energy Required

Now substitute the values into the formula:

\[ 
Q = m \cdot C \cdot \Delta T = 2700 \, \text{g} \times 0.897 \, \text{J/g°C} \times 279°C 
\]

Performing the multiplication:

\[ 
Q = 2700 \times 0.897 \times 279 \approx 676,389.9 \, \text{J} 
\]

Thus, the quantity of heat required to increase the temperature of the aluminum block from 21°C to 300°C is approximately 676,389.9 Joules.","In permanent metal molds, small vent holes are drilled into the mold or  machined into the parting line to permit removal of air and gases.  

#  Heating and Pouring  

To perform a casting operation, the metal must be heated to a temperature some- what above its melting point and then poured into the mold cavity to solidify. Several  aspects of these two steps are discussed in this section.  

# 10.2.1  HEATING THE METAL  

Heating furnaces of various kinds (Section 11.4.1) are used to heat the metal to a  molten temperature sufﬁ  cient for casting. The heat energy required is the sum of (1)  the heat to raise the temperature to the melting point, (2) the heat of fusion to con- vert it from solid to liquid, and (3) the heat to raise the molten metal to the desired  temperature for pouring. This can be expressed:  

$$
H=\rho\,V\{C_{s}\,(T_{m}-\,T_{o})+\,H_{f}+\,C_{l}\,(T_{p}\,-\,T_{m})\}
$$  

where  $H=$  total heat required to raise the temperature of the metal to the pour- ing temperature, J (Btu); $\rho=$  density,  $\mathrm{{g}/\mathrm{{cm}}^{3}}$   $\left(1\mathrm{b}\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{in}^{3}\right)$ ;  $C_{s}=$  weight speciﬁ  c heat for  the solid metal,  $\mathrm{J/g-C}$  (Btu/lbm-F);  $T_{m}=$  melting temperature of the metal, C (F);  $T_{o}=$  starting temperature—usually ambient,  $\mathrm{C}$  (F);  $H_{f}=$  heat of fusion,  $\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{g}$  ( $\mathrm{{'Bup/}}$ lbm);  $C_{1}=$  weight speciﬁ  c heat of the liquid metal, $\mathrm{J/g-C}$  (Btu/lbm-F);  $T_{p}=$  pouring  temperature, C (F); and  $V=$  volume of metal being heated, $\mathrm{cm}^{3}\left(\mathrm{in}^{3}\right)$ .  

# Example 10.1  Heating metal  for casting  

One cubic meter of a certain eutectic alloy is heated in a crucible from room  temperature to $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  above its melting point for casting. The alloy’s density $=$ $7.5\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , melting point $=800^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , speciﬁ  c heat $=0.33\;\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{g}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  in the solid state  and $0.29\,\mathrm{J/g^{\circ}C}$  in the liquid state; and heat of fusion $=160\,\mathrm{J/g}$ . How much heat  energy must be added to accomplish the heating, assuming no losses?  

Solution :  Assume ambient temperature in the foundry $=25^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and that the  density of the liquid and solid states of the metal are the same. Noting that one  $\mathsf{m}^{3}=10^{6}\,\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , and substituting the property values into Equation (10.1),  

$H=(7.5)\,(10^{6})\{0.33(800-25)+160+0.29\,(100)\}=3335(10^{6})\,\mathrm{J}$ The above equation is of conceptual value, but its computational value is limited,  

notwithstanding the calculation in Example 10.1. Use of Equation (10.1) is com- plicated by the following factors: (1) Speciﬁ  c heat and other thermal properties of  a solid metal vary with temperature, especially if the metal undergoes a change of  phase during heating. (2) A metal’s speciﬁ  c heat may be different in the solid and  liquid states. Noting that one  $\mathsf{m}^{3}=10^{6}\,\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , and substituting the property values into Equation (10.1),  

$H=(7.5)\,(10^{6})\{0.33(800-25)+160+0.29\,(100)\}=3335(10^{6})\,\mathrm{J}$ The above equation is of conceptual value, but its computational value is limited,  

notwithstanding the calculation in Example 10.1. Use of Equation (10.1) is com- plicated by the following factors: (1) Speciﬁ  c heat and other thermal properties of  a solid metal vary with temperature, especially if the metal undergoes a change of  phase during heating. (2) A metal’s speciﬁ  c heat may be different in the solid and  liquid states. (3) Most casting metals are alloys, and most alloys melt over a tem- perature range between a solidus and liquidus rather than at a single melting point;  thus, the heat of fusion cannot be applied so simply as indicated above. (4) The  property values required in the equation for a particular alloy are not readily avail- able in most cases. (5) There are signiﬁ  cant heat losses to the environment during  heating.  

# 10.2.2  POURING THE MOLTEN METAL  

After heating, the metal is ready for pouring. Introduction of molten metal into the  mold, including its ﬂ  ow through the gating system and into the cavity, is a critical  step in the casting process. For this step to be successful, the metal must ﬂ  ow into  all regions of the mold before solidifying. Factors affecting the pouring operation  include pouring temperature, pouring rate, and turbulence.  

The  pouring temperature  is the temperature of the molten metal as it is intro- duced into the mold. What is important here is the difference between the tempera- ture at pouring and the temperature at which freezing begins (the melting point for  a pure metal or the liquidus temperature for an alloy). This temperature difference is  sometimes referred to as the  superheat . This term is also used for the amount of heat  that must be removed from the molten metal between pouring and when solidiﬁ  ca- tion commences [7].  

Pouring rate  refers to the volumetric rate at which the molten metal is poured  into the mold. If the rate is too slow, the metal will chill and freeze before ﬁ  lling the  cavity. If the pouring rate is excessive, turbulence can become a serious problem.  Turbulence  in ﬂ  uid ﬂ  ow is characterized by erratic variations in the magnitude and  direction of the velocity throughout the ﬂ  uid. The ﬂ  ow is agitated and irregular  rather than smooth and streamlined, as in laminar ﬂ  ow. Turbulent ﬂ  ow should be  avoided during pouring for several reasons. It tends to accelerate the formation  of metal oxides that can become entrapped during solidiﬁ  cation, thus degrading  the quality of the casting. Turbulence also aggravates  mold erosion , the gradual  wearing away of the mold surfaces due to impact of the ﬂ  owing molten metal.  The densities of most molten metals are much higher than water and other ﬂ  uids  normally encountered. These molten metals are also much more chemically reac- tive than at room temperature. Consequently, the wear caused by the ﬂ  ow of these  metals in the mold is signiﬁ  cant, especially under turbulent conditions. Erosion is  especially serious when it occurs in the main cavity because the geometry of the  cast part is affected.  

# 10.2.3  ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF POURING  

There are several relationships that govern the ﬂ  ow of liquid metal through  the gating system and into the mold. An important relationship is  Bernoulli’s  theorem , which states that the sum of the energies (head, pressure, kinetic, and  friction) at any two points in a ﬂ  owing liquid are equal.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec10.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec10.txt","0.826610740453086, 0.8223013203894685",4.0,4.5
What is the resistance R of a length of copper wire whose length = 10 m and whose diameter = 0.10 mm? Use Table 4.3 as a reference.,"Solution: R = rL/A, A = pi(0.1)^2/4 = 0.007854 mm2 = 0.007854(10^-6) m2 From Table 4.3, r = 1.7 x 10^-8 -m2/m  R = (1.7 x 10^-8  ohm-m2/m)(10 m)/( 0.007854(10^-6) m2) = 2164.5(10^-2) : = 21.65 ohm","To find the resistance \( R \) of a length of copper wire, we use the formula for resistance:

\[
R = \frac{\rho L}{A}
\]

where:
- \( R \) is the resistance,
- \( \rho \) is the resistivity of copper (from Table 4.3, typically \(1.68 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \)),
- \( L \) is the length of the wire,
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the wire.

### Step 1: Calculate the Cross-Sectional Area

The wire is cylindrical, so its cross-sectional area \( A \) can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle:

\[
A = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2
\]

where \( d \) is the diameter of the wire.

Given: \( d = 0.10 \, \text{mm} = 0.10 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \),

\[
A = \pi \left(\frac{0.10 \times 10^{-3}}{2}\right)^2
\]

\[
A = \pi \left(0.05 \times 10^{-3}\right)^2
\]

\[
A = \pi \times 0.0025 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2
\]

\[
A = 7.85 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Resistance

Using the resistance formula:

Given: \( \rho = 1.68 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \), \( L = 10 \, \text{m} \),

\[
R = \frac{(1.68 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m}) \times 10 \, \text{m}}{7.85 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}^2}
\]

\[
R = \frac{1.68 \times 10^{-7} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m}^2}{7.85 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}^2}
\]

\[
R = 21.4 \, \Omega
\]

Thus, the resistance of the 10 m length of copper wire with a diameter of 0.10 mm is \( 21.4 \, \Omega \).","This can be expressed  by the equation

FIGURE 29.12  Resistance welding  (RW), showing the  components in  spot welding, the  predominant process in  the RW group.  

The current used in resistance welding operations is very high (5000–20,000 A,  typically), although voltage is relatively low (usually below  $10\,\mathrm{V}$ ). The duration $t$  of  the current is short in most processes, perhaps lasting 0.1 to  $0.4~\mathrm{s}$  in a typical spot- welding operation.  

The reason why such a high current is used in RW is because (1) the squared term  in Equation (29.3) ampliﬁ  es the effect of current, and (2) the resistance is very low  (around  $0.0001\;\Omega$ ). Resistance in the welding circuit is the sum of (1) resistance of  the electrodes, (2) resistances of the work parts, (3) contact resistances between elec- trodes and work parts, and (4) contact resistance of the faying surfaces. Thus, heat  is generated in all of these regions of electrical resistance. The ideal situation is for  the faying surfaces to be the largest resistance in the sum, because this is the desired  location of the weld. The resistance of the electrodes is minimized by using metals  with very low resistivities, such as copper. Also, the electrodes are often water cooled  to dissipate the heat that is generated there. The work part resistances are a function  of the resistivities of the base metals and the part thicknesses. The contact resist- ances between the electrodes and the parts are determined by the contact areas (i.e.,  size and shape of the electrode) and the condition of the surfaces (e.g., cleanliness  of the work surfaces and scale on the electrode). Finally, the resistance at the faying  surfaces depends on surface ﬁ  nish, cleanliness, contact area, and pressure. No paint,  oil, dirt, or other contaminants should be present to separate the contacting surfaces.  

# Example 29.2  Resistance  welding  

A resistance spot-welding operation performed on two pieces of $2.5\mathrm{-mm}$ -thick  sheet steel uses 12,000 amps for a 0.20-s duration. The electrodes are  $6\,\mathrm{mm}$  in  diameter at the contacting surfaces. Resistance is assumed to be $0.0001\;\Omega$ , and  the resulting weld nugget $6\:\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter and averages $3\:\mathrm{mm}$  in thickness.  The unit melting energy for the metal  $U_{m}=12.0\:\mathrm{J/mm}^{3}$ . What portion of the  heat generated was used to form the weld nugget, and what portion was dis- sipated into the work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air?  

Solution:   The heat generated in the operation is given by Equation (29.3) as.  

$$
H=(12,\!000)^{2}(0.0001)(0.2)=2880\,\mathrm{J}
$$  

The volume of the weld nugget (assumed disc-shaped) is  $\nu=3.0\frac{\pi(6)^{2}}{4}=$ $84.8\;\mathrm{mm}^{3}$ .  

The heat required to melt this volume of metal is  $H w=84.8(12.0)=\mathbf{1018\,J}$ .   The remaining heat,  $\begin{array}{r}{2880{-}1018=1862\;\mathbf{J}}\end{array}$   $(64.7\%$  of the total), is lost into the  work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air. In effect, this loss represents  the combined effect of the heat transfer factor $f_{1}$  and melting factor $f_{2}$   (Section 28.3.2). The heat required to melt this volume of metal is  $H w=84.8(12.0)=\mathbf{1018\,J}$ .   The remaining heat,  $\begin{array}{r}{2880{-}1018=1862\;\mathbf{J}}\end{array}$   $(64.7\%$  of the total), is lost into the  work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air. In effect, this loss represents  the combined effect of the heat transfer factor $f_{1}$  and melting factor $f_{2}$   (Section 28.3.2).  

Success in resistance welding depends on pressure as well as heat. The principal  functions of pressure in RW are to (1) force contact between the electrodes and  the work parts and between the two work surfaces prior to applying current, and  (2) press the faying surfaces together to accomplish coalescence when the proper  welding temperature has been reached.  

General advantages of resistance welding include (1) no ﬁ  ller metal is re- quired, (2) high production rates are possible, (3) lends itself to mechanization and  automation, (4) operator skill level is lower than that required for arc welding, and  (5) good repeatability and reliability. Drawbacks are (1) equipment cost is high— usually much higher than most arc-welding operations, and (2) types of joints that  can be welded are limited to lap joints for most RW processes.  

# 29.2.2  RESISTANCE-WELDING PROCESSES  

The resistance-welding processes of most commercial importance are spot, seam,  and projection welding.  

Resistance Spot Welding  Resistance spot welding is by far the predominant  process in this group. It is widely used in mass production of automobiles, appliances,  metal furniture, and other products made of sheet metal. If one considers that a  typical car body has approximately 10,000 individual spot welds, and that the annual  production of automobiles throughout the world is measured in tens of millions of  units, the economic importance of resistance spot welding can be appreciated.  

Resistance spot welding  (RSW) is an RW process in which fusion of the faying  surfaces of a lap joint is achieved at one location by opposing electrodes. The process  is used to join sheet-metal parts of thickness  $3~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.125 in) or less, using a series  of spot welds, in situations where an airtight assembly is not required. The size and  shape of the weld spot is determined by the electrode tip, the most common elec- trode shape being round, but hexagonal, square, and other shapes are also used. The  resulting weld nugget is typically 5 to  $10\;\mathrm{mm}\;(0.2–0.4\;\mathrm{in})$  in diameter, with a heat- affected zone extending slightly beyond the nugget into the base metals. If the weld  is made properly, its strength will be comparable to that of the surrounding metal.  The steps in a spot welding cycle are depicted in Figure 29.13.

FIGURE 29.13  (a)  Steps in a resistance  spot-welding (RSW)  cycle, and (b) plot of  squeezing force and  current during cycle.  The sequence is: (1)  parts inserted between  open electrodes, (2)  electrodes close and  force is applied, (3)  weld time—current is  switched on, (4) cur- rent is turned off but  force is maintained or  increased (a reduced  current is sometimes  applied near the end of  this step for stress re- lief in the weld region),  and (5) electrodes are  opened, and the welded  assembly is removed.

Materials used for RSW electrodes consist of two main groups: (1) copper-based  alloys and (2) refractory metal compositions such as copper and tungsten combina- tions. The second group is noted for superior wear resistance. As in most manufactur- ing processes, the tooling in spot welding gradually wears out as it is used.","/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec29.txt, /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec29.txt","0.8188030926666459, 0.7989380025653887",4.0,4.6

1. **Determining the Material's Resistivity:**
   Unfortunately, the exact resistivity (_ρ_) value for nickel isn't given here. Let's assume you have access to a typical table that includes this information. Nickel generally has a resistivity of about \( ρ = 6.99 \times 10^{-8} \) ohm-meters at 20°C.

2. **Convert Units:**
   - Wire length (L) is given in feet, which should be converted to meters for consistency with the resistivity units:
     \[
     32.8 \, \text{ft} \times 0.3048 \, \text{m/ft} = 9.99744 \, \text{m}
     \]

3. **Calculate Cross-Sectional Area (A):**
   - The diameter of the wire is given in inches. Convert this to meters:
     \[
     0.0508 \, \text{in} \times 0.0254 \, \text{m/in} = 0.00129032 \, \text{m}
     \]
   - Calculate the cross-sectional area (A) of the wire using the formula for the area of a circle (\(A = \pi r^2\)):
     \[
     r = \frac{0.00129032 \, \text{m}}{2} = 0.00064516 \, \text{m}
     \]
     \[
     A = \pi \times (0.00064516 \, \text{m})^2 \approx 1.30873 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2
     \]

4. **Calculate Resistance (R):**
   - Use the resistance formula \( R = \frac{\rho L}{A} \).
     \[
     R = \frac{6.99 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \times 9.99744 \, \text{m}}{1.30873 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2}
     \]
     \[
     R \approx 0.533 \, \Omega
     \]

### Part (b): Effect of Heating on Resistance

1. **Understanding Temperature Effects:**
   - As the wire heats up due to the current flow, its resistance will change. In metals like nickel, resistance generally increases with temperature.

2. **Temperature Coefficient of Resistance:**
   - Metals have a positive temperature coefficient of resistance, meaning the resistance \( R \) of a wire at temperature \( T \) compared to its initial temperature \( T_0 \) can be found using:
     \[
     R_T = R_0 \times (1 + \alpha \times (T - T_0))
     \]
   - The temperature coefficient (\( \alpha \)) for nickel is typically around \( 0.006 \, \_/^\circ C \).

3. **Impact on Resistance:**
   - If the temperature of the wire rises beyond the reference (often 20°C), the resistance increases linearly with temperature.

The conclusions are that the initial resistance of the wire is approximately 0.533 ohms at 20°C, and this resistance increases if the wire heats up due to current flow, which affects performance and efficiency in electrical applications.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,4.0,4.7

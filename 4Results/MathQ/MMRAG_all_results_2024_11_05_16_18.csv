" A tensile test uses a test specimen that has a gage length of 50 mm and an area = 200 mm2. During the test the specimen yields under a load of 98,000 N. The corresponding gage length = 50.23 mm. 
This is the 0.2 percent yield point. The maximum load of 168,000 N is reached at a gage length = 
64.2 mm. D. Determine (a) yield strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, and (c) tensile strength. ","Solution: (a) Y = 98,000/200 = 490 MPa. (b) s = E e Subtracting the 0.2% offset, e = (50.23 -50.0)/50.0 -0.002 = 0.0026 E = s/e = 490/0.0026 = 188.5 x 103 MPa.  (c) TS = 168,000/200 = 840 MPa.  ","To solve the given problem, we need to find three different mechanical properties from the tensile test data: yield strength, modulus of elasticity, and tensile strength. Let's break down each of these:

### (a) Yield Strength

Yield strength is the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically. For the given problem, it is mentioned that the specimen yields under a load of 98,000 N. To find the yield strength (σᵧ), we use the formula for stress:

\[ \sigma = \frac{F}{A} \]

Where:
- \( \sigma \) is the stress in N/mm² (or MPa).
- \( F \) is the force in Newtons.
- \( A \) is the original cross-sectional area in mm².

Given:
- \( F = 98,000 \, \text{N} \)
- \( A = 200 \, \text{mm}^2 \)

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ \sigma_y = \frac{98,000 \, \text{N}}{200 \, \text{mm}^2} \]
\[ \sigma_y = 490 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \]
\[ \sigma_y = 490 \, \text{MPa} \]

### (b) Modulus of Elasticity

The modulus of elasticity (E) is a measure of the stiffness of a material. It is calculated using the ratio of stress to strain in the elastic region. Since this is the yield point (0.2% or offset yield point), the small change in length can be used to determine the strain, and then E can be calculated.

The formula for strain (ε) is:

\[ \varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0} \]

Where:
- \( \Delta L \) is the change in length = 50.23 mm - 50 mm = 0.23 mm
- \( L_0 \) = original gage length = 50 mm

Substituting these values gives:

\[ \varepsilon = \frac{0.23}{50} \]
\[ \varepsilon = 0.0046 \]

Now, use Hooke's Law to find the modulus of elasticity:

\[ E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon} \]

Using the yield stress \( \sigma_y = 490 \, \text{MPa} \):

\[ E = \frac{490 \, \text{MPa}}{0.0046} \]
\[ E \approx 106,522 \, \text{MPa} \]

### (c) Tensile Strength

Tensile strength (also known as ultimate tensile strength, UTS) is the maximum stress that a material can withstand while being stretched before necking. It is determined at the maximum load.

To find the tensile strength (\( \sigma_u \)), use the load at the maximum:

Given:
- Maximum Load = 168,000 N

Substituting into the stress formula:

\[ \sigma_u = \frac{168,000 \, \text{N}}{200 \, \text{mm}^2} \]
\[ \sigma_u = 840 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \]
\[ \sigma_u = 840 \, \text{MPa} \]

### Final Results

- **Yield Strength** (\( \sigma_y \)): 490 MPa
- **Modulus of Elasticity** (E): 106,522 MPa
- **Tensile Strength** (\( \sigma_u \)): 840 MPa

"A test specimen in a tensile test has a gage length of 2.0 in and an area = 0.5 in2. During the test the specimen yields under a load of 32,000 lb. The corresponding gage length = 2.0083 in. This is the 0.2 percent yield point. The maximum load of 60,000 lb is reached at a gage length = 2.60 in. Determine (a) yield strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, and (c) tensile strength. (d) If fracture occurs at a gage length of 2.92 in, determine the percent elongation. (e) If the specimen necked to an area = 0.25 in2, determine the percent reduction in area.","Solution: (a) Y = 32,000/0.5 = 64,000 lb/in2 (b) s = E e Subtracting the 0.2% offset, e = (2.0083 -2.0)/2.0 -0.002 = 0.00215 E = s/e = 64,000/0.00215 = 29.77 x 106 lb/in2  (c) TS = 60,000/0.5 = 120,000 lb/in2  (d) EL = (2.92 -2.0)/2.0 = 0.92/2.0 = 0.46 = 46%  (e) AR = (0.5 -0.25)/0.5 = 0.50 = 50%","To solve this problem, we need to calculate several key mechanical properties from the tensile test data provided. Let's break this down step-by-step.

### (a) Yield Strength
Yield strength is calculated based on the yield load and the original cross-sectional area of the test specimen. The yield point load is given as 32,000 lb, and the original cross-sectional area is 0.5 in².

\[ \text{Yield Strength} = \frac{\text{Yield Load}}{\text{Original Area}} \]

\[ \text{Yield Strength} = \frac{32,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} = 64,000 \, \text{psi} \]

### (b) Modulus of Elasticity
The modulus of elasticity, or Young's modulus, is the ratio of stress to strain in the elastic deformation region. To find this, we calculate the strain at the 0.2% yield point:

1. Calculate the elastic strain up to the yield point:

\[ \text{Strain at Yield Point} = \frac{\text{Change in Length at Yield Point}}{\text{Original Gage Length}} = \frac{2.0083 \, \text{in} - 2.0 \, \text{in}}{2.0 \, \text{in}} = 0.00415 \]

2. Using the stress at the yield point, which equals the yield strength:

\[ \text{Modulus of Elasticity} = \frac{\text{Yield Strength}}{\text{Strain at Yield Point}} \]

\[ \text{Modulus of Elasticity} = \frac{64,000 \, \text{psi}}{0.00415} = 15,421,686.75 \, \text{psi} \]

### (c) Tensile Strength
Tensile strength is calculated using the maximum load and the original cross-sectional area. The maximum load is given as 60,000 lb.

\[ \text{Tensile Strength} = \frac{\text{Maximum Load}}{\text{Original Area}} \]

\[ \text{Tensile Strength} = \frac{60,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} = 120,000 \, \text{psi} \]

### (d) Percent Elongation
Percent elongation is calculated from the change in gage length at fracture compared to the original gage length.

\[ \text{Percent Elongation} = \left( \frac{\text{Final Gage Length} - \text{Original Gage Length}}{\text{Original Gage Length}} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percent Elongation} = \left( \frac{2.92 \, \text{in} - 2.0 \, \text{in}}{2.0 \, \text{in}} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percent Elongation} = \left( \frac{0.92}{2.0} \right) \times 100\% = 46\% \]

### (e) Percent Reduction in Area
Percent reduction in area is calculated from the change in cross-sectional area at fracture compared to the original cross-sectional area.

\[ \text{Percent Reduction in Area} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Area} - \text{Final Area}}{\text{Original Area}} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percent Reduction in Area} = \left( \frac{0.5 \, \text{in}^2 - 0.25 \, \text{in}^2}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percent Reduction in Area} = \left( \frac{0.25}{0.5} \right) \times 100\% = 50\% \]

In summary, the answers are:
- (a) Yield Strength = 64,000 psi
- (b) Modulus of Elasticity = 15,421,686.75 psi
- (c) Tensile Strength = 120,000 psi

The given problem requires us to find the engineering stress and strain, determine the yield strength, modulus of elasticity, and tensile strength based on the collected data.

Let’s solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate Engineering Stress and Strain

**Engineering Stress \(\sigma\)** is calculated using the formula:
\[ \sigma = \frac{F}{A} \]
where \( F \) is the force and \( A \) is the original cross-sectional area (62.5 mm²).

**Engineering Strain \(\varepsilon\)** is calculated using the formula:
\[ \varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0} = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0} \]
where \( L \) is the current gage length and \( L_0 \) is the original gage length (125.0 mm).

Let's compute these values for each data point:

1. **Point 1:**
   - Force, \(F = 17,793 \, \text{N}\)
   - Gage length, \(L = 125.23 \, \text{mm}\)
   - Stress: 
     \[ \sigma = \frac{17,793}{62.5} = 284.688 \, \text{MPa} \]
   - Strain:
     \[ \varepsilon = \frac{125.23 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.00184 \]

2. **Point 2:**
   - Force, \(F = 23,042 \, \text{N}\)
   - Gage length, \(L = 131.25 \, \text{mm}\)
   - Stress: 
     \[ \sigma = \frac{23,042}{62.5} = 368.672 \, \text{MPa} \]
   - Strain:
     \[ \varepsilon = \frac{131.25 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.0500 \]

3. **Point 3:**
   - Force, \(F = 27,579 \, \text{N}\)
   - Gage length, \(L = 140.05 \, \text{mm}\)
   - Stress: 
     \[ \sigma = \frac{27,579}{62.5} = 441.264 \, \text{MPa} \]
   - Strain:
     \[ \varepsilon = \frac{140.05 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.1204 \]

4. **Point 4:**
   - Force, \(F = 28,913 \, \text{N}\)
   - Gage length, \(L = 147.01 \, \text{mm}\)
   - Stress: 
     \[ \sigma = \frac{28,913}{62.5} = 462.608 \, \text{MPa} \]
   - Strain:
     \[ \varepsilon = \frac{147.01 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.1761 \]

5. **Point 5:**
   - Force, \(F = 27,578 \, \text{N}\)
   - Gage length, \(L = 153.00 \, \text{mm}\)
   - Stress: 
     \[ \sigma = \frac{27,578}{62.5} = 441.248 \, \text{MPa} \]
   - Strain:
     \[ \varepsilon = \frac{153.00 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.224 \]

6. **Point 6:**
   - Force, \(F = 20,462 \, \text{N}\)
   - Gage length, \(L = 160.10 \, \text{mm}\)
   - Stress: 
     \[ \sigma = \frac{20,462}{62.5} = 327.392 \, \text{MPa} \]
   - Strain:
     \[ \varepsilon = \frac{160.10 - 125.0}{125.0} = .281 \]

### Step 2: Plot Engineering Stress-Strain Curve

Plotting the stress-strain values on a graph provides the engineering stress-strain curve. Key features of the curve will help us determine material properties such as yield strength, modulus of elasticity, and tensile strength.

### Step 3: Determine Yield Strength

Yield strength is determined at the point where the material begins to deform plastically. This is often taken at the proportional limit, where the curve first deviates from linearity. It might be necessary to interpolate between data points if needed.

Based on our data, the yield point is hard to pinpoint with precision without additional data or a clearer curve. From point 1 to point 2, the behavior is mostly linear, with plastic deformation presumably starting somewhere between points 2 and 3. A precise method like the 0.2% offset method (if more data was available) can be useful.

### Step 4: Compute Modulus of Elasticity

The modulus of elasticity (E) is the slope of the linear portion of the curve. Use the first two points to approximate:

\[ E \approx \frac{\Delta \sigma}{\Delta \varepsilon} \]
\[ E \approx \frac{368.672 - 284.688}{0.0500 - 0.00184} \]
\[ E \approx \frac{83.984}{0.04816} \]
\[ E \approx 1744.84 \, \text{MPa} \]

### Step 5: Find Tensile Strength

Tensile strength (or ultimate strength) is the highest point on the stress-strain curve. From the data, this is at point 4:

\[ \text{Tensile Strength} = 462.608 \, \text{MPa} \]

### Conclusion:

- **Yield Strength:** You’d need interpolation for a precise value.
- **Modulus of Elasticity:** Approximately \( 1744.84 \, \text{MPa} \).
- **Tensile Strength:** \( 462.608 \, \text{MPa} \).

A tensile test for a certain metal provides flow curve parameters: strain-hardening exponent is 0.3 and strength coefficient is 600 MPa. Determine (a) the flow stress at a true strain = 1.0 and (b) true strain at a flow stress = 600 MPa.,Solution: (a) Yf = 600(1.0)^.3 = 600 MPa (b) H = (600/600)^(1/.3) = (1.0)^3.33 = 1.00,"To solve the problem, we'll use the flow curve equation, which describes the relationship between true stress (\(\sigma\)) and true strain (\(\epsilon\)) in the plastic region:

\[
\sigma = K \epsilon^n
\]

where:
- \(K\) is the strength coefficient.
- \(n\) is the strain-hardening exponent.

### Given
- \(K = 600 \, \text{MPa}\)
- \(n = 0.3\)

### (a) Flow stress at a true strain = 1.0

Substitute \(\epsilon = 1.0\) into the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = 600 \cdot (1.0)^{0.3}
\]

Since any number to the power of 0.3 when that number is 1.0 remains 1:

\[
\sigma = 600 \cdot 1 = 600 \, \text{MPa}
\]

Thus, the flow stress at a true strain of 1.0 is **600 MPa**.

### (b) True strain at a flow stress = 600 MPa

We have:
\[
600 = 600 \cdot \epsilon^{0.3}
\]

Divide both sides by 600:

\[
1 = \epsilon^{0.3}
\]

To solve for \(\epsilon\), raise both sides to the power of \(\frac{1}{0.3}\):

\[
\epsilon = 1^{\frac{1}{0.3}} = 1
\]

Thus, the true strain at a flow stress of 600 MPa is **1.0**.

### Conclusion
For \(K = 600 \, \text{MPa}\) and \(n = 0.3\):
- (a) The flow stress at a true strain of 1.0 is **600 MPa**.
- (b) The true strain at a flow stress of 600 MPa is **1.0**.","Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.

FIGURE 3.5  True stress–strain  curve plotted on log–log scale.  

Because it is a straight line in this transformation of the data, the relationship  between true stress and true strain in the plastic region can be expressed as  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

This equation is called the  ﬂ  ow curve , and it provides a good approximation of the  behavior of metals in the plastic region, including their capacity for strain hardening.  The constant $K$  is called the  strength coefﬁ  cient , MPa  $(1{\mathrm{b}}/{\mathrm{in}}^{2}),$  and it equals the value  of true stress at a true strain value equal to one. The parameter  $n$  is called the  strain  hardening exponent , and it is the slope of the line in Figure 3.5. Its value is directly  related to a metal’s tendency to work harden. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for selected  metals are given in Table 3.4.

Solution:  We have two points on the ﬂ  ow curve from which the ﬂ  ow curve  parameters can be determined: (1) at the yield point and (2) at the maximum  load.  

(1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$

### (a) Determine the flow stress at a true strain of \(0.45\).

**Step 1:** Plug in the known values into the flow curve equation.

**Step 2:** Calculate the power of the strain.

### (b) Determine the true strain at a flow stress of \(40,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2\).

**Step 1:** Use the flow curve equation and solve for \(\epsilon\).

\[

\]

**Step 2:** Divide both sides by \(54,000\).

\[
\frac{40,000}{54,000} = \epsilon^{0.22}
\]

\[
0.7407 \approx \epsilon^{0.22}
\]

**Step 3:** Solve for \(\epsilon\) by raising both sides to the power of \(\frac{1}{0.22}\).

\[
\epsilon \approx 0.7407^{\frac{1}{0.22}} \approx 0.457

(a) The flow stress at a true strain of \(0.45\) is approximately \(39,169 \, \text{lb/in}^2\).

(b) The true strain at a flow stress of \(40,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2\) is approximately \(0.457\).","The typical stress–strain relationship for a metal exhibits elasticity below the  yield point and strain hardening above it. Figures 3.4 and 3.5 indicate this behavior  in linear and logarithmic axes. In the plastic region, the metal’s behavior is expressed  by the ﬂ  ow curve:  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

where $K=$  the strength coefﬁ  cient, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ; and $n$  is the strain hardening expo- nent. The stress  $\sigma$  and strain  $\epsilon$  in the ﬂ  ow curve are true stress and true strain. The  ﬂ  ow curve is generally valid as a relationship that deﬁ  nes a metal’s plastic behavior  in cold working. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for different metals at room temperature  are listed in Table 3.4.  

Flow Stress  The ﬂ  ow curve describes the stress–strain relationship in the region  in which metal forming takes place. It indicates the ﬂ  ow stress of the metal—the  strength property that determines forces and power required to accomplish a par- ticular forming operation. For most metals at room temperature, the stress–strain  plot of Figure 3.5 indicates that as the metal is deformed, its strength increases  due to strain hardening. The stress required to continue deformation must be  increased to match this increase in strength.  Flow stress  is deﬁ  ned as the instan- taneous value of stress required to continue deforming the material—to keep the  metal “ﬂ  owing.” It is the yield strength of the metal as a function of strain, which  can be expressed:  

$$
Y_{f}=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

where  $Y_{f}=$  ﬂ  ow stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ .  

In the individual forming operations discussed in the following two chapters, the  instantaneous ﬂ  ow stress can be used to analyze the process as it is occurring. For  example, in certain forging operations, the instantaneous force during compression  can be determined from the ﬂ  ow stress value. Maximum force can be calculated  based on the ﬂ  ow stress that results from the ﬁ  nal strain at the end of the forging  stroke.  

In other cases, the analysis is based on the average stresses and strains that occur  during deformation rather than instantaneous values. Extrusion represents this case,  Figure 17.2(c). As the billet is reduced in cross section to pass through the extrusion  die opening, the metal gradually strain hardens to reach a maximum value. Rather  than determine a sequence of instantaneous stress–strain values during the reduc- tion, which would be not only difﬁ  cult but also of limited interest, it is more useful to  analyze the process based on the average ﬂ  ow stress during deformation.  

Average Flow Stress  The average ﬂ  ow stress (also called the  mean ﬂ  ow stress ) is  the average value of stress over the stress–strain curve from the beginning of strain  to the ﬁ  nal (maximum) value that occurs during deformation. The value is illustrated  in the stress–strain plot of Figure 17.4. The average ﬂ  ow stress is determined by inte- grating the ﬂ  ow curve equation, Equation (17.1), between zero and the ﬁ  nal strain  value deﬁ  ning the range of interest. This yields the equation:

"A tensile specimen is elongated to twice its original length. Determine the engineering strain and true strain for this test. If the metal had been strained in compression, determine the final compressed length of the specimen such that (a) the engineering strain is equal to the same value as in tension (it will be negative value because of compression), and (b) the true strain would be equal to the same value as in tension (again, it will be negative value because of compression). Note that the answer to part (a) is an impossible result. True strain is therefore a better measure of strain during plastic deformation.","Solution: Engineering strain e = (2.0 -1.0)/1.0 = 1.0 True strain H = ln(2.0/1.0) = ln(2.0) = 0.693 (a) To be compressed to the same engineering strain (e = -1.0) the final height of the compression specimen would have to be zero, which is impossible.  (b) To be compressed to the same true strain value (e = -0.693) the final height of the compression specimen can be determined as follows: H = -.693 = ln(Lf/Lo) Lf/Lo = exp.(-0.693) = 0.500 Therefore, Lf = 0.5 Lo","To solve the question, we need to understand the concepts of engineering strain and true strain:

1. **Engineering Strain (ε):** This is defined as the change in length divided by the original length. For tensile strain, it is given by:
   \[
   ε = \frac{L_{\text{final}} - L_{\text{initial}}}{L_{\text{initial}}}
   \]

2. **True Strain (ε_t):** True strain considers the continuous change in length and is defined as:
   \[
   ε_t = \ln\left(\frac{L_{\text{final}}}{L_{\text{initial}}}\right)
   \]

### Given:

- **Original Length (L_initial):** Assume it is \( L \)
- **Final Length (L_final) in Tension:** Twice its original length, so \( L_{\text{final}} = 2L \)

### Part 1: Calculate Engineering and True Strain in Tension

**Engineering Strain in Tension:**
\[
ε = \frac{L_{\text{final}} - L_{\text{initial}}}{L_{\text{initial}}} = \frac{2L - L}{L} = \frac{L}{L} = 1
\]

**True Strain in Tension:**
\[
ε_t = \ln\left(\frac{L_{\text{final}}}{L_{\text{initial}}}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{2L}{L}\right) = \ln(2) \approx 0.693
\]

### Part 2: Compressive Strain with the Same Engineering (negative) and True Strain

The strain values will be negative due to compression.

**(a) Compressed Engineering Strain:**
For engineering strain in compression to equal -1,
\[
ε_{\text{compression}} = \frac{L_{\text{final, compression}} - L_{\text{initial}}}{L_{\text{initial}}} = -1
\]
\[
\frac{L_{\text{final, compression}} - L}{L} = -1 \Rightarrow L_{\text{final, compression}} - L = -L \Rightarrow L_{\text{final, compression}} = 0
\]

This result means the specimen would need to be compressed to a length of zero, which is physically impossible, hence why this result is noted as impossible.

**(b) Compressed True Strain:**
To find the compressed length with the same true strain value:

\[
ε_{t, \text{compression}} = \ln\left(\frac{L_{\text{final, compression}}}{L_{\text{initial}}}\right) = -0.693
\]
\[
-0.693 = \ln\left(\frac{L_{\text{final, compression}}}{L}\right)
\]

Solving for \( L_{\text{final, compression}} \):
\[
e^{-0.693} = \frac{L_{\text{final, compression}}}{L} \Rightarrow L_{\text{final, compression}} = L \cdot e^{-0.693} \approx 0.5L
\]

### Conclusion:
- **Engineering strain in tension is \( 1 \); in compression, achieving -1 would imply zero length, which is impossible.**
- **True strain in tension is \( \approx 0.693 \); in compression, achieving \(-0.693\) requires final compressed length of approximately \( 0.5L \).**

"Derive an expression for true strain as a function of D and Do for a tensile test specimen of round cross section, where D = the instantaneous diameter of the specimen and Do is its original diameter.","Solution: Starting with the definition of true strain as H = ln(L/Lo) and assuming constant volume, we have V = AoLo = AL Therefore, L/Lo = Ao/A       A =pi D^2 and Ao =pi Do^2 and A0=piD^2        Ao/A = piDo^2/piD^2 = (Do/D)2 H = ln(Do/D)2 = 2ln(Do/D)","To derive an expression for true strain as a function of \( D \) and \( D_o \) for a tensile test specimen of round cross section, we start by understanding what true strain is. True strain (\( \epsilon_t \)) is defined by the natural logarithm of the ratio of the final dimension to the initial dimension.

In the context of diameter for a round specimen, true strain is expressed as:

\[
\epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{A_o}{A}\right)
\]

Because the area of a round cross section is related to the square of its diameter \((A = \frac{\pi}{4} D^2)\), we can substitute area in terms of diameter:

\[
A_o = \frac{\pi}{4} D_o^2, \quad A = \frac{\pi}{4} D^2
\]

Substitute these into the true strain formula:

\[
\epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{\frac{\pi}{4} D_o^2}{\frac{\pi}{4} D^2}\right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{D_o^2}{D^2}\right)
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of the ratio:

\[
\epsilon_t = 2\ln\left(\frac{D_o}{D}\right)
\]

Thus, the true strain as a function of the initial and instantaneous diameters for a round cross section is:

\[
\epsilon_t = 2 \ln\left(\frac{D_o}{D}\right)
\] 

This formula reflects how the material deforms locally during necking, which is critical in understanding material behavior in processes that involve significant plastic deformation.","To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

### Definitions

1. **Engineering Strain (\(e\))**:
   \[
   e = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0}
   \]
   where \(L\) is the final length and \(L_0\) is the original length.

2. **True Strain (\(\epsilon\))**:
   \[
   \epsilon = \int_{L_0}^{L} \frac{dL}{L} = \ln \left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right)
   \]

### Derivation

To connect true strain and engineering strain, we start with the relationship between final and initial lengths in terms of engineering strain:

\[
L = L_0(1 + e)
\]

Substitute this into the equation for true strain:

\[
\epsilon = \ln \left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right) = \ln \left(\frac{L_0(1 + e)}{L_0}\right) = \ln(1 + e)
\]

Thus, we have shown:

\[
\epsilon = \ln(1 + e)
\]

### Explanation

- **Engineering Strain \( e \)** represents the average increase in length per unit length.
- **True Strain \( \epsilon \)** accounts for the continuous change in the specimen's length and is more accurate for large deformations.

### Application

This relationship is crucial in understanding material behavior in the plastic region, especially when designing manufacturing processes like metal forming, where strain hardening occurs.","In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the

previous curve, a downturn ﬁ  nally occurs as a result of necking. A dashed line is used  in the ﬁ  gure to indicate the projected continuation of the true stress–strain plot if  necking had not occurred.  

As strain becomes signiﬁ  cant in the plastic region, the values of true strain and  engineering strain diverge. True strain can be related to the corresponding engineer- ing strain by  

$$
\epsilon=\ln(1+e)
$$  

Similarly, true stress and engineering stress can be related by the expression  

$$
\sigma=s\,(1\,+\,e)
$$  

In Figure 3.4, note that stress increases continuously in the plastic region until  necking begins. When this happened in the engineering stress–strain curve, its sig- niﬁ  cance was lost because an admittedly erroneous area value was used to calculate  stress. Now when the true stress also increases, it cannot be dismissed so lightly.  What it means is that the metal is becoming stronger as strain increases. This is the  property called  strain hardening  that was mentioned in the previous chapter in the  discussion of metallic crystal structures, and it is a property that most metals exhibit  to a greater or lesser degree.  

# Example 3.2  True stress and  strain  

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine (a) true stress and (b) true strain  at the maximum load of  $65{,}000\:\mathrm{N}.$ .  

Solution:  (a) True stress is deﬁ  ned as the load divided by the instantaneous  area. To ﬁ  nd the instantaneous area, we assume uniform elongation prior to  necking. Thus, $A L=A_{o}L_{o}$ , and $A=A_{o}L_{o}/L=200(50)/57.7=173.3\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}/$  

$$
{\sigma=F/A=65,\!000/173.3=375\;\mathrm{MPa}}
$$  

(b) By Equation (3.7), true strain $\epsilon=\ln(L/L_{o})=\ln(57.7/50)=$ $\ln(1.154)={\bf0.143}$ .  

Check:  Use Equations (3.8) and (3.9) to check these values:  

Using Equation (3.8) and the value of  $e$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\epsilon=\ln(1+0.154)=0.143$ .  

Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.

However, it should be noted that these values are associated with the necked portion of the test specimen.","To solve this problem, we need to determine the true stress and true strain at failure for a copper wire with the given data. 

### True Stress at Failure

**True stress (\(\sigma_t\))** is calculated using the relationship:
\[
\sigma_t = \sigma (1 + \epsilon)
\]
where \(\sigma\) is the engineering stress and \(\epsilon\) is the engineering strain.

We know that the engineering stress at failure is 248.2 MPa.

**Ductility** is given as a 75% reduction in the area, which means:
\[
\text{Final Area} = \text{Original Area} \times (1 - 0.75) = 0.25 \times \text{Original Area}
\]

The engineering strain \(\epsilon\) at failure can be calculated using the reduction in area:
\[
\epsilon = \frac{\Delta A}{A_0} = \frac{A_0 - A_f}{A_0} = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75
\]

Substituting these into the true stress formula:
\[
\sigma_t = 248.2 \times (1 + 0.75) = 248.2 \times 1.75 = 434.35 \, \text{MPa}
\]

### True Strain at Failure

**True strain (\(\epsilon_t\))** can be calculated using:
\[
\epsilon_t = \ln \left( \frac{L_f}{L_0} \right)
\]

The true strain formula can also be approximated based on the relationship with the engineering strain:
\[
\epsilon_t = \ln(1 + \epsilon)
\]
Plugging in the values:
\[
\epsilon_t = \ln(1 + 0.75) = \ln(1.75) \approx 0.5596
\]

Therefore, the true stress at failure is **434.35 MPa**, and the true strain at failure is approximately **0.5596**.","During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ .

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4.

- Cross-sectional area (\(A_0\)): 0.5 in²
- Maximum load (\(F\)): 37,000 lb
- Elongation at this point: 24%

Let's calculate:

### True Stress (\(\sigma\)):

True stress is calculated using the actual (instantaneous) cross-sectional area. However, at the point of maximum load before necking begins, we often use the original cross-sectional area for an approximate calculation.

\[
\sigma = \frac{F}{A_0} = \frac{37,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} = 74,000 \, \text{psi}
\]

### True Strain (\(\epsilon\)):

True strain is calculated using the relationship:

\[
\epsilon = \ln \left( \frac{L}{L_0} \right)
\]

Since the elongation is 24%, the final length (\(L\)) is:

\[
L = L_0 + 0.24 \times L_0 = 2.0 \, \text{in} + 0.48 \, \text{in} = 2.48 \, \text{in}
\]

Now calculate the true strain:

\[
\epsilon = \ln \left( \frac{2.48}{2.0} \right) = \ln(1.24) \approx 0.216
\]

The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation.

In material science, the flow curve, described by the equation \( \sigma = K \cdot \epsilon^n \), relates the true stress (\(\sigma\)) to the true strain (\(\epsilon\)), where \( K \) is the strength coefficient and \( n \) is the strain-hardening exponent.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Determine Initial and Final Volumes
The initial and final volumes of the specimen must remain constant because the material is incompressible during deformation.

- **Initial Volume (\(V_i\))**:
  \[
  V_i = \text{Initial Height} \times \text{Cross-sectional Area}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Initial Cross-Sectional Area }(A_i) = \pi \left(\frac{\text{Initial Diameter}}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \left(\frac{25}{2}\right)^2 = 490.875 \, \text{mm}^2
  \]
  \[
  V_i = 62.5 \times 490.875 = 30679.69 \, \text{mm}^3
  \]

- **Final Volume (\(V_f = V_i\))**:
  \[
  V_f = \text{Final Height} \times \text{Final Cross-sectional Area} = 50 \times A_f
  \]
  \[
  A_f = \frac{V_i}{\text{Final Height}} = \frac{30679.69}{50} = 613.59 \, \text{mm}^2
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the True Strain
- **True Strain (\(\epsilon\))**:
  \[
  \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{\text{Initial Height}}{\text{Final Height}}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{62.5}{50}\right) = \ln(1.25) \approx 0.2231
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate True Stress
Using the flow curve equation:
- \( K = 620.5 \, \text{MPa} \)
- \( n = 0.26 \)

\[
\sigma = K \cdot \epsilon^n = 620.5 \cdot (0.2231)^{0.26} \approx 620.5 \cdot 0.6519 \approx 404.27 \, \text{MPa}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Load
The force (or load) required is the product of the true stress and the final cross-sectional area:

\[
\text{Load} (F) = \sigma \cdot A_f
\]
\[
F = 404.27 \, \text{MPa} \times 613.59 \, \text{mm}^2 = 404.27 \times 10^6 \, \text{Pa} \times 613.59 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2 \approx 248187 \, \text{N}

We will use the given flow curve parameters along with the initial dimensions of the specimen. The flow curve relationship typically describes how stress (σ) is related to strain (ε) in plastic deformation, which is useful for understanding the material's behavior under compressive forces.

### Given:

- **Strength coefficient (K)** = 620.5 MPa
- **Strain-hardening exponent (n)** = 0.26
- **Initial height (h₀)** = 62.5 mm
- **Initial diameter (d₀)** = 25 mm
- **Final height (h₁)** = 37.5 mm

### Definitions and equations:

1. **True Strain (εᵗ)**: In compression, true strain can be defined as:
   \[
   \varepsilon^t = \ln\left(\frac{h_0}{h_1}\right)
   \]
2. **True Stress (σᵗ)**: Using the flow equation:
   \[
   \sigma^t = K \cdot (\varepsilon^t)^n

   \[
   \text{Initial Volume} = \text{Final Volume}
   \]
   \[
   \pi \cdot \left(\frac{d_0}{2}\right)^2 \cdot h_0 = \pi \cdot \left(\frac{d_1}{2}\right)^2 \cdot h_1

   \[
   d_1 = d_0 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{h_0}{h_1}}
   \]

4. **Load (P)**: Calculate using area (Aᵢ) and stress (σᵗ):
   \[
   P = \sigma^t \cdot A_1
   \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the true strain (εᵗ)**:
   \[
   \varepsilon^t = \ln\left(\frac{62.5}{37.5}\right) = \ln(1.6667) \approx 0.5108

2. **Calculate the true stress (σᵗ)**:
   \[
   \sigma^t = 620.5 \times (0.5108)^{0.26}

   \[
   \sigma^t \approx 620.5 \times 0.7692 \approx 477.19 \text{ MPa}

   \[
   d_1 = 25 \times \sqrt{\frac{62.5}{37.5}} = 25 \times \sqrt{1.6667} \approx 25 \times 1.29099 \approx 32.27 \text{ mm}

4. **Calculate the final cross-sectional area (A₁)**:
   \[
   A_1 = \pi \times \left(\frac{32.27}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \times (16.135)^2 \approx 819.59 \text{ mm}^2

   \[
   P = 477.19 \times 819.59 \approx 390956 \text{ N} \approx 391 \text{ kN}

The yield strength is the amount of stress at which a material begins to deform plastically. For metals, it's commonly determined using the 0.2% offset method.

**Given:**
- Modulus of elasticity (E) = 30 x 10^6 lb/in²
- Initial height (h₀) = 2.0 in
- Diameter (d) = 1.5 in
- Load at yield point = 140,000 lb
- Load at a shortened height of 1.6 in = 260,000 lb

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Initial Cross-Sectional Area (A₀):**

   The cross-sectional area of a cylinder is given by the formula:
   \[
   A₀ = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}
   \]

   Plugging in the diameter:
   \[
   A₀ = \frac{\pi (1.5)^2}{4} = \frac{\pi \times 2.25}{4} = \frac{2.25\pi}{4} \approx 1.7671 \, \text{in}^2
   \]

2. **Calculate the Yield Strength (σᵧ):**

   Yield strength is defined as the stress at the yield load. Using the formula for stress (σ), which is force (F) divided by area (A):
   \[
   \sigma = \frac{F}{A}
   \]

   For the yield load:
   \[
   \sigmaᵧ = \frac{140,000 \, \text{lb}}{1.7671 \, \text{in}^2} \approx 79,222 \, \text{lb/in}^2

Hardness tests are commonly used for assessing material properties because they  are quick and convenient. However, a variety of testing methods are appropriate  because of differences in hardness among different materials. The best-known hard- ness tests are Brinell and Rockwell.

"In a torsion test, a torque of 5000 ft-lb is applied which causes an angular deflection = 1q on a thin-walled tubular specimen whose radius = 1.5 in, wall thickness = 0.10 in, and gage length = 2.0 in.

(b) J = RD/L, D = 1(2pi/360) = 0.01745 rad., J = 1.5(0.01745)/2.0 = 0.01309  ","To solve this problem, we need to compute the shear stress and shear strain for the given torsion test parameters. Let's break it down step by step.

### Given Data:
- Torque (\(T\)) = 5000 ft-lb
- Radius (\(R\)) = 1.5 in
- Wall thickness (\(t\)) = 0.10 in
- Gage length (\(L\)) = 2.0 in
- Angular deflection (\(\alpha\)) = 1° = \(\frac{\pi}{180}\) radians (since 1° = \(\frac{\pi}{180}\) rad)

### Part (a): Calculate Shear Stress (\(\tau\))
The shear stress in a thin-walled tubular member is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{T}{2\pi R^2 t}
\]

1. **Convert torque to consistent units**:
   - Since the radius is in inches, convert torque from ft-lb to in-lb:
   - \(5000 \, \text{ft-lb} = 5000 \times 12 \, \text{in-lb} = 60000 \, \text{in-lb}\)

2. **Plug in the values**:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{60000}{2 \pi (1.5)^2 (0.10)}
   \]

3. **Calculate**:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{60000}{2\pi \times 2.25 \times 0.10} = \frac{60000}{1.4137} \approx 42428.64 \, \text{psi}
   \]

### Part (b): Calculate Shear Strain (\(\gamma\))
The shear strain for the angular deflection is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{R\alpha}{L}
\]

1. **Plug in the values**:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1.5 \times \frac{\pi}{180}}{2.0}
   \]

2. **Calculate**:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1.5 \times 0.01745}{2.0} = \frac{0.026175}{2.0} = 0.0130875 \, \text{in/in}
   \]

### Results:
- Shear Stress (\(\tau\)) = 42428.64 psi
- Shear Strain (\(\gamma\)) = 0.0130875 in/in

These calculations provide you with the shear stress and strain for the specified conditions of the torsion test.","Shear strain can be deﬁ  ned as  

$$

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12. As torque  is increased, the tube deﬂ  ects by twisting, which is a shear strain for this geometry. The shear stress can be determined in the test by the equation  

$$

For a tested hardness of HB = 182, TS = 500(182) = 91,000 lb/in2.","To solve this problem, we'll calculate the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN) using the provided data. The Brinell hardness test involves pressing a hard ball into the material under a specific load and measuring the diameter of the indentation. 

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### (a) Determine the Brinell hardness number for the metal.

1. **Given:**
   - Load (F) = 1500 kg
   - Diameter of indenter (D) = 10 mm
   - Diameter of indentation (d) = 3.2 mm
   
2. **Convert Load to Newtons:**
   - Since Brinell hardness involves using the force in Newtons, we convert the weight from kg to Newtons: 
   \[
   F = 1500 \text{ kg} \times 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2 = 14715 \text{ N}
   \]

3. **Brinell Hardness Number Formula:**
   - The formula to calculate the Brinell hardness number (BHN) is:
   \[
   \text{BHN} = \frac{2F}{\pi D \left(D - \sqrt{D^2 - d^2}\right)}
   \]
   
4. **Plug in the known values:**
   - Here, \( F = 14715 \text{ N} \), \( D = 10 \text{ mm} \), \( d = 3.2 \text{ mm} \).
   - First, calculate \( D^2 - d^2 \):
     \[
     D^2 = 10^2 = 100 \text{ mm}^2
     \]
     \[
     d^2 = 3.2^2 = 10.24 \text{ mm}^2
     \]
     \[
     D^2 - d^2 = 100 - 10.24 = 89.76 \text{ mm}^2
     \]
     
   - Now, calculate the following term:
     \[
     D - \sqrt{D^2 - d^2} = 10 - \sqrt{89.76}
     \]
     \[
     \sqrt{89.76} \approx 9.47
     \]
     \[
     D - \sqrt{D^2 - d^2} = 10 - 9.47 = 0.53
     \]

   - Now, substitute these back into the BHN formula:
     \[
     \text{BHN} = \frac{2 \times 14715}{\pi \times 10 \times 0.53}
     \]
     \[
     \text{BHN} = \frac{29430}{16.66} \approx 1766.97
     \]

Thus, the **Brinell hardness number (BHN) for the metal is approximately 177**.

#### (b) If the specimen is steel, estimate the tensile strength of the steel.

For steels, there is a common empirical correlation between BHN and tensile strength (TS). One typical approximation is:

   \[
   \text{TS (MPa)} \approx \text{BHN} \times 3.5
   \]

- Applying this approximation:

  \[
  \text{TS} \approx 177 \times 3.5 \approx 619.5 \text{ MPa}
  \]

Therefore, the **tensile strength of the steel is estimated to be approximately 620 MPa**.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.25
"One of the inspectors in the quality control department has frequently used the Brinell and Rockwell hardness tests, for which equipment is available in the company. He claims that all hardness tests are based on the same principle as the Brinell test, which is that hardness is always measured as the applied load divided by the area of the impressions made by an indentor. (a) Is he correct? (b) If not, what are some of the other principles involved in hardness testing, and what are the associated tests?","Solution: (a) No, the claim is not correct. Not all hardness tests are based on the applied load divided by area, but many of them are. (b) Some of the other hardness tests and operating principles include: (1) Rockwell hardness test, which measures the depth of indentation of a cone resulting from an applied load; (2) Scleroscope, which measures the rebound height of a hammer dropped from a certain distance against a surface specimen; and (3) Durometer, which measures elastic deformation by pressing an indentor into the surface of rubber and similar soft materials.","To address the inspector's claim and answer the provided questions, let's explore the principles of hardness testing and the differences among various methods.

### (a) Is the inspector correct?

The inspector's claim that all hardness tests are based on the principle of the applied load divided by the area of the impressions is not entirely correct. This principle specifically describes the Brinell hardness test, which calculates hardness using a spherical indenter pressed into the material under a specified load. The Brinell hardness number (BHN) is determined by dividing the load by the surface area of the indentation. The calculation is as follows:

\[ \text{BHN} = \frac{2P}{\pi D (D - \sqrt{D^2 - d^2})} \]

Where:
- \( P \) = applied load
- \( D \) = diameter of the indenter
- \( d \) = diameter of the impression

However, not all hardness tests use the same principle as the Brinell test.

### (b) If not, what are some of the other principles involved in hardness testing, and what are the associated tests?

There are several other hardness testing methods that utilize different principles:

1. **Rockwell Hardness Test:**
   - The principle behind the Rockwell test involves measuring the depth of penetration of an indenter under a large load compared to the penetration made by a preload.
   - The Rockwell scale provides a hardness number directly, which is derived from the depth of indentation.
   - The test uses either a conical diamond or a hard steel ball as the indenter, depending on the material being tested. The number is displayed on a dial gauge attached to the machine.

2. **Vickers Hardness Test:**
   - This test also involves dividing the load by the area of the indentation created, but it uses a diamond pyramid indenter which forms a square indent.
   - The formula for Vickers hardness (HV) is:
     \[ \text{HV} = \frac{1.8544 \times P}{d^2} \]
   - Here, the impression's diagonal length, \( d \), is used to calculate the area.

3. **Knoop Hardness Test:**
   - Similar to the Vickers test, but uses an elongated diamond-shaped indenter.
   - It is particularly useful for brittle materials and thin sections.

4. **Shore Scleroscope Test:**
   - This test measures the height of the rebound of a diamond-tipped hammer dropped from a fixed height onto the surface.
   - The hardness is quantified by the rebound height; higher rebound indicates higher hardness.

5. **Leeb Rebound Hardness Test:**
   - This is a portable test where an impact body with a spherical test tip strikes the sample and rebounds.
   - The ratio of rebound velocity to impact velocity is used to calculate hardness.

### Conclusion

Different hardness tests are based on various principles and methodologies tailored to accommodate the physical nature of materials and specific testing requirements. While the Brinell test uses a straightforward calculation of force over the area, others, like Rockwell, Vickers, or Knoop, use distinct principles such as depth of penetration or diagonal measurements of impressions.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.26
"A batch of annealed steel has just been received from the vendor. It is supposed to have a tensile strength in the range 60,000 -70,000 lb/in2. A Brinell hardness test in the receiving department yields a value of HB = 118. (a) Does the steel meet the specification on tensile strength?","Solution: (a) TS = 500(HB) = 500(118) = 59,000 lb/in2. This lies outside the specified range of 60,000 to 70,000 lb/in2. However, from a legal standpoint, it is unlikely that the batch can be rejected on the basis of its measured Brinell hardness number without using an actual tensile test to measure TS. The formula for converting from Brinell hardness number to tensile strength is only an approximating equation. ","To determine if the received batch of annealed steel meets the specified tensile strength range of 60,000 - 70,000 lb/in², we can use the relationship between Brinell hardness number (HB) and tensile strength (\( \sigma_t \)) in steels. This relationship is typically expressed as an empirical correlation:

\[
\sigma_t = C \times HB
\]

where:
- \( \sigma_t \) is the tensile strength in psi.
- \( HB \) is the Brinell hardness number.
- \( C \) is an empirical constant that varies depending on the material, often given as approximately 500 for steel.

Let's calculate the tensile strength using the given Brinell hardness number:

1. **Identify the given Brinell hardness number**: HB = 118.
2. **Use the empirical constant** for steel \( C = 500 \) (a typical value for low carbon steel).

   \[
   \sigma_t = 500 \times 118 = 59,000 \text{ psi}
   \]

3. **Compare the calculated tensile strength** to the specified range:

   - The calculated tensile strength is 59,000 psi.
   - The specified tensile strength range is 60,000 to 70,000 psi.

4. **Determine if the steel meets the specifications**:

   - Since 59,000 psi is less than the lower limit of 60,000 psi, the steel does not meet the specified tensile strength requirement.

**Conclusion**: Based on the Brinell hardness test yielding a value of HB = 118, the tensile strength calculated for this batch of steel is 59,000 psi, which is below the specified range of 60,000 - 70,000 psi.

(b) Estimate the yield strength of the material.","Solution:  (b) Based on Table 3.2 in the text, the ratio of Y to TS for low carbon steel = 25,000/45,000 =0.555. Using this ratio, we can estimate the yield strength to be Y = 0.555(59,000) = 32,700 lb/in2.","To estimate the yield strength of the annealed steel using the Brinell hardness number (HB), we need to use established correlations between hardness and tensile properties of materials. One commonly used empirical relationship is the correlation between the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN) and the yield strength (\( \sigma_y \)).

The yield strength can be estimated by:

\[
\sigma_y \approx \frac{\text{BHN}}{C}
\]

Where:
- \( \sigma_y \) is the yield strength in MPa.
- BHN refers to the Brinell hardness number.
- \( C \) is a factor that depends on the material type, generally taken around 3.0 to 3.5 for steels.

Given:
- Brinell Hardness Number (HB) = 118
- We will use \( C = 3.5 \) for steels (as a common approximation).

Step-by-step calculation:

1. Apply the relationship:

   \[
   \sigma_y \approx \frac{118}{3.5}
   \]

2. Calculate the yield strength:

   \[
   \sigma_y \approx \frac{118}{3.5} \approx 33.71 \text{ MPa}
   \]

However, yield strength is often reported in ksi (thousand pounds per square inch) or lb/in², especially in the context of the tensile strength range given (60,000 - 70,000 lb/in²). So, we need to convert the units:

1 MPa = 145.038 lb/in²

Therefore, 

\[
\sigma_y \approx 33.71 \times 145.038 \approx 4889.56 \text{ lb/in²}
\]

This yield strength is significantly low compared to the typical tensile strength range provided (60,000 - 70,000 lb/in²), suggesting that either the calculation needs revisiting or there may be a contextual error in measurement or material expectation.

In practice, if the calculated yield strength is far from expected, it might necessitate:
- Reviewing the factors used in calculations.
- Verification of hardness testing procedures.
- Checking if there’s a specific material property that should be applied.

"Two flat plates, separated by a space of 4 mm, are moving relative to each other at a velocity of 5 m/sec. The space between them is occupied by a fluid of unknown viscosity. The motion of the plates is resisted by a shear stress of 10 Pa due to the viscosity of the fluid. Assuming that the velocity gradient of the fluid is constant, determine the coefficient of viscosity of the fluid.",Solution: Shear rate = (5 m/s x 1000 mm/m)/(4 mm) = 1250 s-1 K = (10N/m2)/(1250 s-1) = 0.008 N-s/m2 = 0.008 Pa-s,"To determine the coefficient of viscosity of the fluid between the two plates, we can use Newton's law of viscosity. This law expresses the relationship between shear stress (\(\tau\)), velocity gradient (\(\frac{du}{dy}\)), and viscosity (\(\mu\)) as:

\[
\tau = \mu \times \left(\frac{du}{dy}\right)
\]

Where:
- \(\tau\) is the shear stress acting on the fluid, given as 10 Pa.
- \(\frac{du}{dy}\) is the velocity gradient, which is the change in velocity (\(u\)) per unit distance (\(y\)) perpendicular to the direction of flow.
- \(\mu\) is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, which we are trying to find.

### Step 1: Determine the Velocity Gradient (\(\frac{du}{dy}\))

The velocity gradient is assumed to be constant, and it's calculated as the relative velocity of the plates divided by the distance separating them. Given:
- Velocity of the moving plate is 5 m/s,
- The separation distance between the plates is 4 mm, which is equal to 0.004 meters.

Thus, the velocity gradient is:

\[
\frac{du}{dy} = \frac{u}{y} = \frac{5 \, \text{m/s}}{0.004 \, \text{m}}
\]

Calculating the above expression gives:

\[
\frac{du}{dy} = 1250 \, \text{s}^{-1}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Coefficient of Viscosity (\(\mu\))

Now, we rearrange the formula to solve for the viscosity:

\[
\mu = \frac{\tau}{\frac{du}{dy}}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\mu = \frac{10 \, \text{Pa}}{1250 \, \text{s}^{-1}}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\mu = 0.008 \, \text{Pa s}
\]

Thus, the coefficient of viscosity of the fluid is \(0.008 \, \text{Pa s}\). This means the fluid has a viscosity of 0.008 pascal-seconds.

If the velocity gradient in the space between the surfaces is constant, determine the viscosity of the fluid.",Solution: Shear rate = (25 in/sec)/(0.5 in) = 50 sec-1 K = (0.3 lb/in2)/(50 sec-1) = 0.0006 lb-sec/in2.,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between shear stress, viscosity, and velocity gradient in the context of fluid dynamics. The scenario described involves two parallel surfaces with a fluid in between them, which is a classic case for applying Newton's Law of Viscosity.

**Newton's Law of Viscosity** is given by:

\[ \tau = \mu \left( \frac{du}{dy} \right) \]

Where:
- \( \tau \) is the shear stress applied by the fluid (lb/in\(^2\)).
- \( \mu \) is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (lb⋅s/in\(^2\)).
- \( \frac{du}{dy} \) is the velocity gradient perpendicular to the direction of flow (in/sec per in).

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. **Identify Given Values:**
   - Shear Stress (\( \tau \)): 0.3 lb/in\(^2\)
   - Velocity of moving plate (\( u \)): 25 in/sec
   - Separation between the surfaces (\( y \)): 0.5 in

2. **Assume the Relationship:**
   Since we're assuming a constant velocity gradient, the velocity changes linearly across the layer of fluid. Thus, the velocity gradient \( \frac{du}{dy} \) can be defined as:

   \[ \frac{du}{dy} = \frac{\Delta u}{\Delta y} \]

   Here,
   - \(\Delta u = 25\) in/sec (since one plate is moving at 25 in/sec and the other is stationary),

A 125.0-mm-diameter shaft rotates inside a stationary bushing whose inside diameter = 125.6 mm and length = 50.0 mm.

The shaft rotates at a velocity of 400 rev/min; this speed and the action of the oil are sufficient to keep the shaft centered inside the bushing.

We'll apply the formula for viscous torque in a concentric cylindrical system (shaft and bushing), considering the fluid between them. Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem

We have a shaft with a diameter of 125.0 mm rotating inside a bushing with an inside diameter of 125.6 mm. This sets up a lubrication film between the shaft and the bushing. The length of the bushing is 50.0 mm, and the viscosity of the lubricating oil is 0.14 Pa·s. The shaft rotates at 400 revolutions per minute (rev/min).

### Step 2: Convert Units

1. **Convert diameters to meters:**
   - Shaft diameter = 125.0 mm = 0.125 m
   - Bushing inside diameter = 125.6 mm = 0.1256 m

2. **Calculate the radial clearance:**
   \[
   \text{Clearance} (\delta) = \text{bushing diameter} - \text{shaft diameter} = 0.1256 \, \text{m} - 0.125 \, \text{m} = 0.0006 \, \text{m}
   \]

3. **Convert rotational speed to radians per second:**
   \[
   \text{Rotational speed} = 400 \, \text{rev/min} = 400 \times \frac{2\pi \, \text{rad}}{60 \, \text{s}} = \frac{400 \times 2\pi}{60} \, \text{rad/s} \approx 41.89 \, \text{rad/s}
   \]

### Step 3: Determine the Viscous Torque

The torque due to viscosity (\( T \)) in a concentric cylindrical arrangement can be calculated using the formula:
\[
T = \frac{2\pi \cdot L \cdot R^3 \cdot \omega \cdot \mu}{\delta}
\]
where:
- \( L \) is the length of the bushing (0.050 m),
- \( R \) is the average radius of the shaft, calculated as the radius of the shaft,
- \(\omega\) is the angular velocity in rad/s,
- \( \mu \) is the dynamic viscosity (0.14 Pa·s),
- \( \delta \) is the radial clearance.

First, calculate the radius of the shaft:
\[ 
R = \frac{\text{Diameter of the shaft}}{2} = \frac{0.125 \, \text{m}}{2} = 0.0625 \, \text{m}
\]

Now, substitute the given values into the torque formula:
\[
T = \frac{2\pi \times 0.050 \cdot (0.0625)^3 \cdot 41.89 \cdot 0.14}{0.0006}
\]

### Step 4: Perform the Calculation

Calculate \( R^3 \):
\[
R^3 = (0.0625)^3 = 0.000244140625 \, \text{m}^3
\]

Substitute and compute:
\[
T = \frac{2\pi \times 0.050 \times 0.000244140625 \times 41.89 \times 0.14}{0.0006}
\]

\[
T \approx \frac{0.0043290045}{0.0006} = 7.2150075 \, \text{N·m}
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion

The magnitude of the torque due to viscosity that resists the rotation of the shaft is approximately **7.22 N·m**.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,3.0,3.3
"The starting diameter of a shaft is 25.00 mm. This shaft is to be inserted into a hole in an expansion fit assembly operation.

This is typically quantified using the concept of thermal expansion (or contraction, in this case). We'll need to determine how much we need to cool the shaft to achieve the desired reduction in diameter.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Understand the Reduction Needed:**

   - Initial diameter of the shaft: \( D_i = 25.00 \, \text{mm} \)
   - Final desired diameter: \( D_f = 24.98 \, \text{mm} \)
   - Needed reduction in diameter: \( \Delta D = D_i - D_f = 25.00 \, \text{mm} - 24.98 \, \text{mm} = 0.02 \, \text{mm} \)

2. **Thermal Contraction Formula:**

   The change in dimension due to temperature change can be calculated using the linear thermal expansion formula:
   \[
   \Delta D = D_i \times \alpha \times \Delta T
   \]
   Where:
   - \(\Delta D\) = change in diameter required
   - \(D_i\) = original diameter
   - \(\alpha\) = coefficient of linear thermal expansion (material-specific value)
   - \(\Delta T\) = change in temperature 

   Rearrange the formula to solve for \(\Delta T\):
   \[
   \Delta T = \frac{\Delta D}{D_i \times \alpha}
   \]

3. **Material Expansion Coefficient:**

   Since the context does not provide specific values, assume the material of the shaft is steel. A typical value for the linear thermal expansion coefficient \(\alpha\) for steel is approximately \(11 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C}^{-1}\).

4. **Calculation of Temperature Change (\(\Delta T\)):**

   Substitute the known values into the rearranged formula:
   \[
   \Delta T = \frac{0.02 \, \text{mm}}{25.00 \, \text{mm} \times 11 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C}^{-1}}
   \]

   \[
   \Delta T = \frac{0.02}{25.00 \times 11 \times 10^{-6}}
   \]

   \[
   \Delta T = \frac{0.02}{0.000275}
   \]

   \[
   \Delta T \approx 72.73 \, \text{C}
   \]

5. **Final Shaft Temperature:**

   To find the temperature the shaft must be reduced to, subtract \(\Delta T\) from the room temperature:
   \[
   T_f = 20 \, \text{C} - 72.73 \, \text{C}
   \]

   \[
   T_f \approx -52.73 \, \text{C}
   \]

### Conclusion:

The shaft must be cooled to approximately \(-52.73^\circ \text{C}\) to reduce its diameter from 25.00 mm to 24.98 mm.

The formula to use is:

\[
\rho_T = \frac{\rho_0}{1 + \beta (T - T_0)}
\]

Where:
- \(\rho_T\) is the density at temperature \(T\).
- \(\rho_0 = 2.70 \, \text{g/cm}^3\) is the initial density at room temperature (20°C).
- \(\beta\) is the coefficient of linear expansion (for aluminum, approximately \(23 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{°C}^{-1}\)).
- \(T\) is the final temperature (650°C).
- \(T_0\) is the initial temperature (20°C).

1. **Calculate the change in temperature:**

   \[
   \Delta T = 650°C - 20°C = 630°C

2. **Use the formula to calculate the new density:**

   \[
   \rho_{650} = \frac{2.70 \, \text{g/cm}^3}{1 + 23 \times 10^{-6} \times 630}

   \[
   \rho_{650} = \frac{2.70 \, \text{g/cm}^3}{1 + 0.01449}

   \[
   \rho_{650} = \frac{2.70 \, \text{g/cm}^3}{1.01449}
   \]

   \[
   \rho_{650} \approx 2.662 \, \text{g/cm}^3

Thus, the density of aluminum at 650°C is approximately \(2.662 \, \text{g/cm}^3\).","# TABLE  •  6.1   (continued): (f) Titanium.

as an ore because of its higher Ti content. In recovery of the metal from its ores, the  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  is converted to titanium tetrachloride  $\mathrm{(TiCl_{4})}$  by reacting the compound with  chlorine gas. This is followed by a sequence of distillation steps to remove impurities.  The  highly concentrated  $\mathrm{TiCl_{4}}$  is then reduced to metallic titanium by reaction with  magnesium; this is known as the  Kroll process . Sodium can also be used as a reduc-  ing agent. In either case, an inert atmosphere must be maintained to prevent $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ , $\mathbf{N}_{2}$ ,  or $\mathrm{H}_{2}$  from contaminating the Ti, owing to its chemical affinity for these gases. The  resulting metal is used to cast ingots of titanium and its alloys.  

Properties of Titanium  Ti’s coefficient of thermal expansion is relatively low  among metals. It is stiffer and stronger than aluminum, and it retains good strength  at elevated temperatures. Pure titanium is reactive, which presents problems in  processing, especially in the molten state. However, at room temperature it forms  a thin adherent oxide coating $\left(\mathrm{TiO}_{2}\right)$  that provides excellent corrosion resistance.  

These properties give rise to two principal application areas for titanium: (1) in  the commercially pure state, Ti is used for corrosion resistant components, such as  marine components and prosthetic implants; and (2) titanium alloys are used as  high-strength components in temperatures ranging from ambient to above  $550^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ $(1000^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ), especially where its excellent strength-to-weight ratio is exploited.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Identify Given Values:**

   - Initial Temperature (\(T_1\)): 70°F
   - Final Temperature (\(T_2\)): 500°F

   \]

### Conclusion

The increase in length of the steel bar when heated from 70°F to 500°F is approximately \(0.028\) inches.

This calculation assumes a constant coefficient of thermal expansion and that the steel bar remains in the solid phase without phase transformations.","The change in  length corresponding to a given temperature change is given by:  

$$
L_{2}-L_{1}=a L_{1}\left(T_{2}-T_{1}\right)
$$  

where $a=$   coefficient of thermal expansion, $^{\circ}\mathbf{C}^{\cdot1}(^{\circ}\mathbf{F}^{\cdot1})$ ; and $L_{1}$  and $L_{2}$  are lengths,  mm (in), corresponding, respectively, to temperatures $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2},\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\ (^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ .  

Values of coefficient of thermal expansion given in Table 4.1 suggest that it has  a linear relationship with temperature. This is only an approximation. Not only is  length affected by temperature, but the thermal expansion coefficient itself is also  affected. For some materials it increases with temperature; for other materials it  decreases. These changes are usually not significant enough to be of much concern,  and values like those in the table are quite useful in design calculations for the range  of temperatures contemplated in service. Changes in the coefficient are more sub-  stantial when the metal undergoes a phase transformation, such as from solid to  liquid, or from one crystal structure to another.  

In manufacturing operations, thermal expansion is put to good use in shrink fit  and expansion fit assemblies (Section 31.3), in which a part is heated to increase its  size or cooled to decrease its size to permit insertion into some other part. When the  part returns to ambient temperature, a tightly fitted assembly is obtained. Thermal  expansion can be a problem in heat treatment (Chapter 26) and welding (Section  29.6) because of thermal stresses that develop in the material during these processes.  

# 4.1.3  MELTING  CHARACTERISTICS  

For a pure element, the  melting point $T_{m}$   is the temperature at which the mate- rial  transforms from solid to liquid state. The reverse transformation, from liquid to  solid,  occurs at the same temperature and is called the  freezing point . For crystalline  elements,  such as metals, the melting and freezing temperatures are the same. A cer- tain  amount of heat energy, called the  heat of fusion , is required at this temperature to  accomplish the transformation from solid to liquid.  

Melting of a metal element at a specific temperature assumes equilibrium condi-  tions. Exceptions occur in nature; for example, when a molten metal is cooled, it may  remain in the liquid state below its freezing point if nucleation of crystals does not  initiate immediately. When this happens, the liquid is said to be  supercooled .  

There are other variations in the melting process—differences in the way melt-  ing occurs in different materials. For example, unlike pure metals, most metal alloys  do not have a single melting point. Instead, melting begins at a certain temperature,   called the  solidus , and continues as   the temperature increases until finally convert-  ing completely to the liquid state at a temperature called the  liquidus . Between the  two temperatures, the alloy is a mixture of solid and molten metals, the amounts of  each being inversely proportional to their relative distances from the liquidus and  solidus. Although most alloys behave in this way, exceptions are eutectic alloys that

melt (and freeze) at a single temperature. These issues are examined in the discus-  sion of phase diagrams in Chapter 6.  

Another difference in melting occurs with noncrystalline materials (glasses). In  these materials, there is a gradual transition from solid to liquid states. The solid  material gradually softens as temperature increases, finally becoming liquid at the  melting point. During softening, the material has a consistency of increasing plasticity  (increasingly like a fluid) as it gets closer to the melting point.  

These differences in melting characteristics among pure metals, alloys, and glass  are portrayed in Figure 4.1.

\[ 
H = \rho \, V \, C_s \, (T_f - T_i)
\]

Where:
- \( H \) = total heat required (J)
- \( \rho \) = density of aluminum, ~2.7 g/cm³
- \( V \) = volume of the aluminum block
- \( C_s \) = specific heat capacity of aluminum (approximately 0.897 J/g°C)
- \( T_f \) = final temperature, 300°C
- \( T_i \) = initial temperature, 21°C

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate Volume (V):**

   The dimensions of the aluminum block are 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, so:

   \[
   V = 10 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} = 1000 \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

2. **Calculate Mass:**

   Using the density of aluminum:

   \[
   \text{mass} = \rho \times V = 2.7 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \times 1000 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2700 \, \text{g}
   \]

3. **Calculate Heat (H):**

   Substitute the values into the formula:

   \[
   H = 2700 \, \text{g} \times 0.897 \, \text{J/g°C} \times (300°C - 21°C)
   \]

   \[
   H = 2700 \times 0.897 \times 279
   \]

   \[
   H \approx 675,969 \, \text{J}
   \]

So, approximately 675,969 Joules of heat are required to raise the temperature of the aluminum block from 21°C to 300°C.","In permanent metal molds, small vent holes are drilled into the mold or  machined into the parting line to permit removal of air and gases.  

#  Heating and Pouring  

To perform a casting operation, the metal must be heated to a temperature some- what above its melting point and then poured into the mold cavity to solidify. Several  aspects of these two steps are discussed in this section.  

# 10.2.1  HEATING THE METAL  

Heating furnaces of various kinds (Section 11.4.1) are used to heat the metal to a  molten temperature sufﬁ  cient for casting. The heat energy required is the sum of (1)  the heat to raise the temperature to the melting point, (2) the heat of fusion to con- vert it from solid to liquid, and (3) the heat to raise the molten metal to the desired  temperature for pouring. This can be expressed:  

$$
H=\rho\,V\{C_{s}\,(T_{m}-\,T_{o})+\,H_{f}+\,C_{l}\,(T_{p}\,-\,T_{m})\}
$$  

where  $H=$  total heat required to raise the temperature of the metal to the pour- ing temperature, J (Btu); $\rho=$  density,  $\mathrm{{g}/\mathrm{{cm}}^{3}}$   $\left(1\mathrm{b}\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{in}^{3}\right)$ ;  $C_{s}=$  weight speciﬁ  c heat for  the solid metal,  $\mathrm{J/g-C}$  (Btu/lbm-F);  $T_{m}=$  melting temperature of the metal, C (F);  $T_{o}=$  starting temperature—usually ambient,  $\mathrm{C}$  (F);  $H_{f}=$  heat of fusion,  $\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{g}$  ( $\mathrm{{'Bup/}}$ lbm);  $C_{1}=$  weight speciﬁ  c heat of the liquid metal, $\mathrm{J/g-C}$  (Btu/lbm-F);  $T_{p}=$  pouring  temperature, C (F); and  $V=$  volume of metal being heated, $\mathrm{cm}^{3}\left(\mathrm{in}^{3}\right)$ .  

# Example 10.1  Heating metal  for casting  

One cubic meter of a certain eutectic alloy is heated in a crucible from room  temperature to $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  above its melting point for casting. The alloy’s density $=$ $7.5\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , melting point $=800^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , speciﬁ  c heat $=0.33\;\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{g}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  in the solid state  and $0.29\,\mathrm{J/g^{\circ}C}$  in the liquid state; and heat of fusion $=160\,\mathrm{J/g}$ . How much heat  energy must be added to accomplish the heating, assuming no losses?  

Solution :  Assume ambient temperature in the foundry $=25^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and that the  density of the liquid and solid states of the metal are the same. Noting that one  $\mathsf{m}^{3}=10^{6}\,\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , and substituting the property values into Equation (10.1),  

$H=(7.5)\,(10^{6})\{0.33(800-25)+160+0.29\,(100)\}=3335(10^{6})\,\mathrm{J}$ The above equation is of conceptual value, but its computational value is limited,  

notwithstanding the calculation in Example 10.1. Use of Equation (10.1) is com- plicated by the following factors: (1) Speciﬁ  c heat and other thermal properties of  a solid metal vary with temperature, especially if the metal undergoes a change of  phase during heating. (2) A metal’s speciﬁ  c heat may be different in the solid and  liquid states.

What is the resistance R of a length of copper wire whose length = 10 m and whose diameter = 0.10 mm? Use Table 4.3 as a reference.,"Solution: R = rL/A, A = pi(0.1)^2/4 = 0.007854 mm2 = 0.007854(10^-6) m2 From Table 4.3, r = 1.7 x 10^-8 -m2/m  R = (1.7 x 10^-8  ohm-m2/m)(10 m)/( 0.007854(10^-6) m2) = 2164.5(10^-2) : = 21.65 ohm","To find the resistance \( R \) of a copper wire, we use the formula:

\[
R = \rho \frac{L}{A}
\]

where:
- \( \rho \) is the resistivity of copper,
- \( L \) is the length of the wire,
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the wire.

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Find the resistivity \(\rho\) of copper:**
   - The resistivity of copper is typically around \(1.68 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m}\).

2. **Given:**
   - Length \( L = 10 \, \text{m} \)
   - Diameter \( d = 0.10 \, \text{mm} = 0.0001 \, \text{m} \)

3. **Calculate the cross-sectional area \( A \) of the wire:**
   \[
   A = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \left(\frac{0.0001}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \left(0.00005\right)^2
   \]
   \[
   A \approx 7.85 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}^2
   \]

4. **Calculate the resistance \( R \):**
   \[
   R = 1.68 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \times \frac{10 \, \text{m}}{7.85 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}^2}
   \]
   \[
   R \approx 0.0214 \, \Omega
   \]

Thus, the resistance of the 10-meter long copper wire with a diameter of 0.10 mm is approximately \( 0.0214 \, \Omega \).","This can be expressed  by the equation

FIGURE 29.12  Resistance welding  (RW), showing the  components in  spot welding, the  predominant process in  the RW group.  

The current used in resistance welding operations is very high (5000–20,000 A,  typically), although voltage is relatively low (usually below  $10\,\mathrm{V}$ ). The duration $t$  of  the current is short in most processes, perhaps lasting 0.1 to  $0.4~\mathrm{s}$  in a typical spot- welding operation.  

The reason why such a high current is used in RW is because (1) the squared term  in Equation (29.3) ampliﬁ  es the effect of current, and (2) the resistance is very low  (around  $0.0001\;\Omega$ ). Resistance in the welding circuit is the sum of (1) resistance of  the electrodes, (2) resistances of the work parts, (3) contact resistances between elec- trodes and work parts, and (4) contact resistance of the faying surfaces. Thus, heat  is generated in all of these regions of electrical resistance. The ideal situation is for  the faying surfaces to be the largest resistance in the sum, because this is the desired  location of the weld. The resistance of the electrodes is minimized by using metals  with very low resistivities, such as copper. Also, the electrodes are often water cooled  to dissipate the heat that is generated there. The work part resistances are a function  of the resistivities of the base metals and the part thicknesses. The contact resist- ances between the electrodes and the parts are determined by the contact areas (i.e.,  size and shape of the electrode) and the condition of the surfaces (e.g., cleanliness  of the work surfaces and scale on the electrode). Finally, the resistance at the faying  surfaces depends on surface ﬁ  nish, cleanliness, contact area, and pressure. No paint,  oil, dirt, or other contaminants should be present to separate the contacting surfaces.  

# Example 29.2  Resistance  welding  

A resistance spot-welding operation performed on two pieces of $2.5\mathrm{-mm}$ -thick  sheet steel uses 12,000 amps for a 0.20-s duration. The electrodes are  $6\,\mathrm{mm}$  in  diameter at the contacting surfaces. Resistance is assumed to be $0.0001\;\Omega$ , and  the resulting weld nugget $6\:\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter and averages $3\:\mathrm{mm}$  in thickness.  The unit melting energy for the metal  $U_{m}=12.0\:\mathrm{J/mm}^{3}$ . What portion of the  heat generated was used to form the weld nugget, and what portion was dis- sipated into the work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air?  

Solution:   The heat generated in the operation is given by Equation (29.3) as.  

$$
H=(12,\!000)^{2}(0.0001)(0.2)=2880\,\mathrm{J}
$$  

The volume of the weld nugget (assumed disc-shaped) is  $\nu=3.0\frac{\pi(6)^{2}}{4}=$ $84.8\;\mathrm{mm}^{3}$ .  

The heat required to melt this volume of metal is  $H w=84.8(12.0)=\mathbf{1018\,J}$ .   The remaining heat,  $\begin{array}{r}{2880{-}1018=1862\;\mathbf{J}}\end{array}$   $(64.7\%$  of the total), is lost into the  work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air. In effect, this loss represents  the combined effect of the heat transfer factor $f_{1}$  and melting factor $f_{2}$   (Section 28.3.2).

Since nickel is a metal, the resistivity would increase, causing the resistance to increase. This, in turn, would cause slightly more heat to be generated.","To solve the given problem, we'll address each part of the question systematically and explain the reasoning behind each step.

### Part (a): Calculating the Resistance of the Wire

To calculate the resistance of the wire, we need to use the formula for resistance of a uniform wire:

\[ R = \frac{\rho \cdot L}{A} \]

Where:
- \( R \) is the resistance.
- \( \rho \) is the resistivity of the material (which we'll assume is contained in Table 4.3).
- \( L \) is the length of the wire.
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the wire.

**Step 1: Obtain the Resistivity (\(\rho\))**

Without the specific values from Table 4.3, I'll assume typical values. The resistivity of nickel at room temperature is approximately \( 6.99 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega\cdot m\).

**Step 2: Convert Length to Meters**

The length of the wire given is 32.8 ft. We need this in meters.
- 1 foot = 0.3048 meters

\[ L = 32.8 \, \text{ft} \times 0.3048 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{ft}} = 9.99744 \, \text{m} \approx 10.0 \, \text{m} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the Cross-sectional Area (A)**

The diameter of the wire is given in inches, so we need to convert that to meters first:
- 1 inch = 0.0254 meters

\[ \text{Diameter} = 0.0508 \, \text{in} \times 0.0254 \, \frac{\text{m}}{\text{in}} = 0.00129 \, \text{m} \]

The area \( A \) of a circle is given by:

\[ A = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 \]

\[ A = \pi \left(\frac{0.00129}{2}\right)^2 \approx 1.31 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2 \]

**Step 4: Substitute the Values into the Resistance Formula**

\[ R = \frac{6.99 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega\cdot m \times 10.0 \, \text{m}}{1.31 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2} \]

\[ R \approx \frac{6.99 \times 10^{-7} \, \Omega \cdot m}{1.31 \times 10^{-6} \, m^2} \]

\[ R \approx 0.533 \, \Omega \]

So, the resistance of the wire is approximately \( 0.533 \, \Omega \).

### Part (b): Effect of Heat on Resistance

In metals like nickel, increasing the temperature tends to increase the resistance. This is because heating causes the atoms in the metal to vibrate more, which makes it harder for electrons to flow through, effectively increasing resistivity.

Resistance is related to temperature by the formula:

\[ R_T = R_0(1 + \alpha \Delta T) \]

Where:
- \( R_T \) is the resistance at temperature \( T \).
- \( R_0 \) is the original resistance.
- \( \alpha \) is the temperature coefficient of resistance.
- \( \Delta T \) is the change in temperature.

For nickel, the temperature coefficient (\( \alpha \)) is around \( 0.006 \, \text{per degree Celsius} \). As \( \Delta T \) increases, the term \( \alpha \Delta T \) increases, hence \( R_T \) becomes significantly greater than \( R_0 \).

Therefore, if a current heats the wire, it can be expected to increase the resistance of the wire according to this relation.",No context found.,No file paths found.,No scores found.,4.0,4.7

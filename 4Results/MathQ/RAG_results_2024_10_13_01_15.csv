"23.01 Flank wear data were collected in a series of turning tests using a coated carbide tool on hardened alloy steel at a feed of 0.30 mm/rev and a depth of 4.0 mm. At a speed of 125 m/min, flank wear = 0.12 mm at 1 min, 0.27 mm at 5 min, 0.45 mm at 11 min, 0.58 mm at 15 min, 0.73 at 20 min, and","Solution: (a) and (b) Student exercises. For part (a), at v1 = 125 m/min, T1 = 20.4 min using criterion FW = 0.75 mm, and at v2 = 165 m/min, T2 = 10.0 min using criterion FW = 0.75 mm. In part (b), values of C and n may vary due to variations in the plots. The values should be approximately the same as those obtained in part (c) below.  (c) Two equations: (1) 125(20.4)n = C, and (2) 165(10.0)n = C (1) and (2) 125(20.4)n = 165(10.0)n ln 125 + n ln 20.4 = ln 165 + n ln 10.0 4.8283 + 3.0155 n = 5.1059 + 2.3026 n 0.7129 n = 0.2776 n = 0.3894 (1) C = 125(20.4)0.3894 = 404.46 (2) C = 165(10.0)0.3894 = 404.46 C = 404.46","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the flank wear data collected during the turning tests and determine the tool life using the Taylor Tool Life Equation. The Taylor Tool Life Equation is given by:

\[
\nu T^n = C
\]

where:
- \(\nu\) is the cutting speed in m/min,
- \(T\) is the tool life in minutes,
- \(n\) and \(C\) are constants that depend on the material and cutting conditions.

Given the data:
- Cutting speed, \(\nu = 125 \, \text{m/min}\)
- Flank wear measurements at different times:
  - 0.12 mm at 1 min
  - 0.27 mm at 5 min
  - 0.45 mm at 11 min
  - 0.58 mm at 15 min
  - 0.73 mm at 20 min

The problem does not specify a particular flank wear value to define tool life, but a common criterion is a flank wear of 0.5 mm. We will use this criterion to determine the tool life.

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Identify the Time for 0.5 mm Flank Wear:**
   - From the data, we see that the flank wear is 0.45 mm at 11 min and 0.58 mm at 15 min.
   - The flank wear of 0.5 mm occurs between 11 min and 15 min.
   - We can interpolate to find the exact time when the flank wear reaches 0.5 mm.

2. **Linear Interpolation:**
   - Assume a linear relationship between time and flank wear between 11 min and 15 min.
   - The equation of the line between these two points is:
     \[
     \text{Wear} = \text{Wear}_{11} + \left(\frac{\text{Wear}_{15} - \text{Wear}_{11}}{15 - 11}\right) \times (T - 11)
     \]
   - Plug in the values:
     \[
     0.5 = 0.45 + \left(\frac{0.58 - 0.45}{15 - 11}\right) \times (T - 11)
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     0.5 = 0.45 + \left(\frac{0.13}{4}\right) \times (T - 11)
     \]
     \[
     0.5 = 0.45 + 0.0325 \times (T - 11)
     \]
   - Solve for \(T\):
     \[
     0.05 = 0.0325 \times (T - 11)
     \]
     \[
     T - 11 = \frac{0.05}{0.0325}
     \]
     \[
     T - 11 = 1.5385
     \]
     \[
     T = 12.5385 \, \text{min}
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The tool life, defined by a flank wear of 0.5 mm, is approximately 12.54 minutes at a cutting speed of 125 m/min.

Thus, the tool life for the given conditions is approximately 12.54 minutes.","Accordingly, two main types of tool wear can be distinguished: crater  wear and ﬂ  ank wear, illustrated in Figures 22.1 and 22.2. A single-point tool is used to  explain tool wear and the mechanisms that cause it.  Crater wear , Figure 22.2(a), con- sists of a cavity in the rake face of the tool that forms and grows from the action of the  chip sliding against the surface. High stresses and temperatures characterize the tool– chip contact interface, contributing to the wearing action. The crater can be measured  either by its depth or its area.  Flank wear , Figure 22.2(b), occurs on the ﬂ  ank, or relief  face, of the tool. It results from rubbing between the newly generated work surface  and the ﬂ  ank face adjacent to the cutting edge. Flank wear is measured by the width of  the wear band, FW. This wear band is sometimes called the ﬂ  ank wear  land .  

Certain features of ﬂ  ank wear can be identiﬁ  ed. First, an extreme condition of  ﬂ  ank wear often appears on the cutting edge at the location corresponding to the  original surface of the work part. This is called  notch wear . It occurs because the  original work surface is harder and/or more abrasive than the internal material,  which could be caused by work hardening from cold drawing or previous machining,  sand particles in the surface from casting, or other reasons. As a consequence of the  harder surface, wear is accelerated at this location. A second region of ﬂ  ank wear  that can be identiﬁ  ed is  nose radius wear ; this occurs on the nose radius leading into  the end cutting edge.

The mechanisms that cause wear at the tool–chip and tool–work interfaces in  machining can be summarized as follows:  

➢   Abrasion . This is a mechanical wearing action caused by hard particles in the work  material gouging and removing small portions of the tool. This abrasive action  occurs in both ﬂ  ank wear and crater wear; it is a signiﬁ  cant cause of ﬂ  ank wear.

 ➢   Adhesion . When two metals are forced into contact under high pressure and  temperature, adhesion (welding) occurs between them. These conditions are  present between the chip and the rake face of the tool. As the chip ﬂ  ows across  the tool, small particles of the tool adhere to the chip and are broken away from  the surface, resulting in attrition of the surface.  

Diffusion . This is a process in which an exchange of atoms takes place across  a close contact boundary between two materials (Section 4.3). In the case of  tool wear, diffusion occurs at the tool–chip boundary, causing the tool surface  to become depleted of the atoms responsible for its hardness. As this process  continues, the tool surface becomes more susceptible to abrasion and adhesion.  Diffusion is believed to be a principal mechanism of crater wear.  

Chemical reactions . The high temperatures and clean surfaces at the tool–chip  interface in machining at high speeds can result in chemical reactions, in particu- lar, oxidation, on the rake face of the tool. The oxidized layer, being softer than  the parent tool material, is sheared away, exposing new material to sustain the  reaction process.  

Plastic deformation . Another mechanism that contributes to tool wear is plastic  deformation of the cutting edge. The cutting forces acting on the cutting edge at  high temperature cause the edge to deform plastically, making it more vulnerable  to abrasion of the tool surface. If the tool wear curves are plotted for  several different cutting speeds, the results appear as in Figure 22.4. As cutting speed is  increased, wear rate increases so the same level of wear is reached in less time.  

Tool life  is deﬁ  ned as the length of cutting time that the tool can be used. Operat- ing the tool until ﬁ  nal catastrophic failure is one way of deﬁ  ning tool life. This is in- dicated in Figure 22.4 by the end of each tool wear curve. However, in production, it  is often a disadvantage to use the tool until this failure occurs because of difﬁ  culties  in resharpening the tool and problems with work surface quality. As an alternative,  a level of tool wear can be selected as a criterion of tool life, and the tool is replaced  when wear reaches that level. A convenient tool life criterion is a certain ﬂ  ank wear  value, such as $0.5\,\mathrm{mm}\,(0.020\,\mathrm{in})$ , illustrated as the horizontal line on the graph. When  each of the three wear curves intersects that line, the life of the corresponding tool is  deﬁ  ned as ended. If the intersection points are projected down to the time axis, the  values of tool life can be identiﬁ  ed.  

Taylor Tool Life Equation  If the tool life values for the three wear curves in  Figure 22.4 are plotted on a natural log–log graph of cutting speed versus tool life,  the resulting relationship is a straight line as shown in Figure 22.5.  

The discovery of this relationship around 1900 is credited to F. W. Taylor. It can be  expressed in equation form and is called the Taylor tool life equation:  

$$
\nu T^{n}=C
$$

FIGURE 22.5  Natural  log–log plot of cutting  speed vs. tool life.  

where  $\nu=$  cutting speed, $\mathrm{m/min}$   $(\mathrm{ft/min})$ ); $T=$  tool life, min; and $n$  and  $C$  are param- eters whose values depend on feed, depth of cut, work material, tooling (material in  particular), and the tool life criterion used. The value of  $n$  is relative constant for a  given tool material, whereas the value of $C$  depends on tool material, work material,  and cutting conditions.  

Basically, Equation (22.1) states that higher cutting speeds result in shorter tool  lives. Relating the parameters $n$  and  $C$  to Figure 22.5,  $n$  is the slope of the plot (ex- pressed in linear terms rather than in the scale of the axes), and $C$  is the intercept on  the speed axis.  $C$  represents the cutting speed that results in a 1-min tool life.  

The problem with Equation (22.1) is that the units on the right-hand side of the  equation are not consistent with the units on the left-hand side. To make the units  consistent, the equation should be expressed in the form  

$$
\nu T^{n}=C\left(T_{\mathrm{ref}}^{n}\right)
$$  

where  $T_{\mathrm{ref}}=\mathrm{a}$  reference value for  $C$ .  $T_{\mathrm{ref}}$  is simply  $1\;\mathrm{{min}}$  when  $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{min}$  (ft/min) and  minutes are used for  $\nu$  and  $T$ , respectively. The advantage of Equation (22.2) is seen  when it is desired to use the Taylor equation with units other than  $\mathrm{m/min}\ \mathrm{(ft/min)}$   and minutes—for example, if cutting speed were expressed as $\mathrm{m/sec}$  and tool life as  sec. In this case,  $T_{\mathrm{ref}}$  would be $60\;\mathrm{sec}$  and  $C$  would therefore be the same speed value  as in Equation (22.1), although converted to units of  $\mathrm{m/sec}$ . This can be converted  to feed rate by taking into account the spindle speed and the number of teeth on the  cutter as follows:  

$$
f_{r}=N n_{t}f
$$  

where $f_{r}=$  feed rate, mm/min  $(\mathrm{in}/\mathrm{min})$ ); $N=$  spindle speed, rev/min; $n_{t}=$  number of  teeth on the cutter; and $\overline{{f\!\equiv\!}}$  chip load in mm/tooth (in/tooth).  

Material removal rate in milling is determined using the product of the cross- sectional area of the cut and the feed rate. Accordingly, if a slab-milling operation is  cutting a workpiece with width $w$  at a depth $d$ , the material removal rate is  

$$
R_{M R}=w d\,f_{r}
$$

FIGURE 21.21  Slab (peripheral) milling  showing entry of cutter  into the workpiece.  

This neglects the initial entry of the cutter before full engagement. Equation (21.15)  can be applied to end milling, side milling, face milling, and other milling operations,  making the proper adjustments in the computation of cross-sectional area of cut.  

The time required to mill a workpiece of length  $L$  must account for the approach  distance required to fully engage the cutter. First, consider the case of slab milling,  Figure 21.21. To determine the time to perform a slab milling operation, the approach  distance $A$  to reach full cutter depth is given by  

$$
A=\sqrt{d(D-d)}
$$  

where  $d=$  depth of cut, mm (in); and  $D=$  diameter of the milling cutter, mm (in).  The time $T_{m}$  in which the cutter is engaged milling the workpiece is therefore  

$$
T_{m}=\frac{L+A}{f_{r}}
$$  

For face milling, consider the two possible cases pictured in Figure 21.22. The ﬁ  rst  case is when the cutter is centered over a rectangular workpiece as in Figure 21.22(a).  The cutter feeds from right to left across the workpiece. In order for the cutter to  reach the full width of the work, it must travel an approach distance given by  

$$
A=0.5\big(D-\sqrt{D^{2}-w^{2}}\big)
$$  

where  $D=$ cutter diameter, mm (in) and  $w=$ width of the workpiece,  $\mathrm{mm}$  (in). If  $D=w$ , then Equation (21.18) reduces to  $A=0.5D$ . And if  $D<w$ , then a slot is cut  into the work and $A=0.5D$ .  

The second case is when the cutter is offset to one side of the work, as in Figure  21.22(b). In this case, the approach distance is given by  

$$
A={\sqrt{w(D-w)}}
$$  

where $w=$  width of the cut, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in). In either case, the machining time is given by  

$$
T_{m}=\frac{L+A}{f_{r}}
$$  

It should be emphasized in all of these milling scenarios that  $T_{m}$  represents the  time the cutter teeth are engaged in the work, making chips. Overtravel distances are  usually added at the beginning and end of each cut to allow access to the work for  loading and unloading. Thus the actual duration of the cutter feed motion is likely  to be greater than  $T_{m}$ .

For part (a), at v1 = 125 m/min, T1 = 13.0 min using criterion FW = 0.50 mm, and at v2 = 165 m/min, T2 = 5.6 min using criterion FW = 0.50 mm. In part (b), values of C and n may vary due to variations in the plots. The values should be approximately the same as those obtained in part (c) below. (c) Two equations: (1) 125(13.0)n = C, and (2) 165(5.6)n = C (1) and (2) 125(13.0)n = 165(5.6)n ln 125 + n ln 13.0 = ln 165 + n ln 5.6 4.8283 + 2.5649 n = 5.1059 + 1.7228 n 0.8421 n = 0.2776 n = 0.3296  (1) C = 125(13.0)0.3894 = 291.14  (2) C = 165(5.6)0.3894 = 291.15 C = 291.15","To solve this problem, we need to apply the Taylor Tool Life Equation, which is given by:

\[
\nu T^{n} = C
\]

where:
- \(\nu\) is the cutting speed,
- \(T\) is the tool life,
- \(n\) and \(C\) are parameters that depend on various factors such as feed, depth of cut, work material, tooling, and the tool life criterion.

The problem asks us to solve Problem 23.1 with a tool life criterion of 0.50 mm of flank land wear instead of 0.75 mm. Although we don't have the details of Problem 23.1, we can infer that it involves calculating the tool life using the Taylor Tool Life Equation with a different wear criterion.

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Understand the Relationship**: The Taylor Tool Life Equation shows that tool life \(T\) is inversely related to cutting speed \(\nu\). As the cutting speed increases, the tool life decreases.

2. **Adjust the Tool Life Criterion**: The original problem (Problem 23.1) likely used a tool life criterion of 0.75 mm of flank wear. We need to adjust this to 0.50 mm. This means that the tool will be replaced sooner, resulting in a shorter tool life for the same cutting speed.

3. **Determine the New Tool Life**: Since the tool life criterion is reduced from 0.75 mm to 0.50 mm, the tool life \(T\) will decrease. The relationship between tool wear and tool life is typically linear for small changes, so we can use a proportional relationship to estimate the new tool life.

4. **Calculate the New Tool Life**: If the original tool life for 0.75 mm wear was \(T_{\text{original}}\), then the new tool life \(T_{\text{new}}\) for 0.50 mm wear can be estimated by:

   \[
   T_{\text{new}} = T_{\text{original}} \times \frac{0.50}{0.75}
   \]

   This assumes a linear relationship between wear and tool life.

5. **Apply the Taylor Tool Life Equation**: If we have the values of \(n\) and \(C\) from the original problem, we can use them to calculate the new cutting speed \(\nu_{\text{new}}\) for the adjusted tool life \(T_{\text{new}}\).

   \[
   \nu_{\text{new}} T_{\text{new}}^{n} = C
   \]

   Solve for \(\nu_{\text{new}}\):

   \[
   \nu_{\text{new}} = \frac{C}{T_{\text{new}}^{n}}
   \]

### Conclusion:

Without the specific values of \(n\), \(C\), and \(T_{\text{original}}\) from Problem 23.1, we cannot compute a numerical answer. However, the steps above outline the process to adjust the tool life and calculate the new cutting speed using the Taylor Tool Life Equation. If you have the specific values from Problem 23.1, you can substitute them into the equations to find the final answer.","If the tool wear curves are plotted for  several different cutting speeds, the results appear as in Figure 22.4. As cutting speed is  increased, wear rate increases so the same level of wear is reached in less time.  

Tool life  is deﬁ  ned as the length of cutting time that the tool can be used. Operat- ing the tool until ﬁ  nal catastrophic failure is one way of deﬁ  ning tool life. This is in- dicated in Figure 22.4 by the end of each tool wear curve. However, in production, it  is often a disadvantage to use the tool until this failure occurs because of difﬁ  culties  in resharpening the tool and problems with work surface quality. As an alternative,  a level of tool wear can be selected as a criterion of tool life, and the tool is replaced  when wear reaches that level. A convenient tool life criterion is a certain ﬂ  ank wear  value, such as $0.5\,\mathrm{mm}\,(0.020\,\mathrm{in})$ , illustrated as the horizontal line on the graph. When  each of the three wear curves intersects that line, the life of the corresponding tool is  deﬁ  ned as ended. If the intersection points are projected down to the time axis, the  values of tool life can be identiﬁ  ed.  

Taylor Tool Life Equation  If the tool life values for the three wear curves in  Figure 22.4 are plotted on a natural log–log graph of cutting speed versus tool life,  the resulting relationship is a straight line as shown in Figure 22.5.  

The discovery of this relationship around 1900 is credited to F. W. Taylor. It can be  expressed in equation form and is called the Taylor tool life equation:  

$$

The value of  $n$  is relative constant for a  given tool material, whereas the value of $C$  depends on tool material, work material,  and cutting conditions.  

Basically, Equation (22.1) states that higher cutting speeds result in shorter tool  lives.

The problem with Equation (22.1) is that the units on the right-hand side of the  equation are not consistent with the units on the left-hand side. To make the units  consistent, the equation should be expressed in the form  

$$
\nu T^{n}=C\left(T_{\mathrm{ref}}^{n}\right)
$$  

where  $T_{\mathrm{ref}}=\mathrm{a}$  reference value for  $C$ .  $T_{\mathrm{ref}}$  is simply  $1\;\mathrm{{min}}$  when  $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{min}$  (ft/min) and  minutes are used for  $\nu$  and  $T$ , respectively. The advantage of Equation (22.2) is seen  when it is desired to use the Taylor equation with units other than  $\mathrm{m/min}\ \mathrm{(ft/min)}$   and minutes—for example, if cutting speed were expressed as $\mathrm{m/sec}$  and tool life as  sec. In this case,  $T_{\mathrm{ref}}$  would be $60\;\mathrm{sec}$  and  $C$  would therefore be the same speed value  as in Equation (22.1), although converted to units of  $\mathrm{m/sec}$ .

The mechanisms that cause wear at the tool–chip and tool–work interfaces in  machining can be summarized as follows:  

➢   Abrasion . This is a mechanical wearing action caused by hard particles in the work  material gouging and removing small portions of the tool. This abrasive action  occurs in both ﬂ  ank wear and crater wear; it is a signiﬁ  cant cause of ﬂ  ank wear.

# Cutting-Tool  Cutting-Tool  Technology Technology  

Machining operations are accomplished using cutting  tools. The high forces and temperatures during ma- chining create a very harsh environment for the tool.  If   cutting force becomes too high, the tool fractures. If  cutting temperature becomes too high, the tool materi- al softens and fails. If neither of these conditions causes  the tool to fail, continual wear of the cutting edge ulti- mately leads to failure.

Cutting tool technology has two principal aspects:  tool material and tool geometry. The ﬁ  rst is concerned  with developing materials that can withstand the   forces,  temperatures, and wearing action in the machining  process. The second deals with optimizing the geometry  of the cutting tool for the tool material and for a given  operation. It is appropriate to begin by considering tool  life, because this is a prerequisite for much of the subse- quent discussion on tool materials. It also seems appro- priate to include a section on cutting ﬂ  uids at the end of  this chapter; cutting ﬂ  uids are often used in machining  operations to prolong the life of a cutting tool.

# 22.4 Cutting Fluids  

As suggested by the opening paragraph, there are  three possible modes by which a cutting tool can fail in  machining:  

22.4.1 Types of Cutting Fluids 22.4.2 Application of Cutting Fluids  

1.  Fracture failure . This mode of failure occurs when  the cutting force at the tool point becomes exces- sive, causing it to fail suddenly by brittle fracture.

 2.  Temperature failure . This failure occurs when the  cutting temperature is too high for the tool mate- rial, causing the material at the tool point to soften,  which leads to plastic deformation and loss of the  sharp edge.

 3.  Gradual wear . Gradual wearing of the cutting  edge causes loss of tool shape, reduction in cutting  efﬁ  ciency, an acceleration of wearing as the tool  becomes heavily worn, and ﬁ  nally tool failure in a  manner similar to a temperature failure. Fracture and temperature failures result in premature loss of the cutting tool.  

These two modes of failure are therefore undesirable. Of the three possible tool  failures, gradual wear is preferred because it leads to the longest possible use of the  tool, with the associated economic advantage of that longer use.  

Product quality must also be considered when attempting to control the mode of  tool failure. When the tool point fails suddenly during a cut, it often causes damage  to the work surface. This damage requires either rework of the surface or possible  scrapping of the part. The damage can be avoided by selecting cutting conditions  that favor gradual wearing of the tool rather than fracture or temperature failure,  and by changing the tool before the ﬁ  nal catastrophic loss of the cutting edge occurs.  

# 22.1.1  TOOL WEAR  

Gradual wear occurs at two principal locations on a cutting tool: the top rake face  and the ﬂ  ank. Accordingly, two main types of tool wear can be distinguished: crater  wear and ﬂ  ank wear, illustrated in Figures 22.1 and 22.2. A single-point tool is used to  explain tool wear and the mechanisms that cause it.  Crater wear , Figure 22.2(a), con- sists of a cavity in the rake face of the tool that forms and grows from the action of the  chip sliding against the surface. High stresses and temperatures characterize the tool– chip contact interface, contributing to the wearing action. The crater can be measured  either by its depth or its area.  Flank wear , Figure 22.2(b), occurs on the ﬂ  ank, or relief  face, of the tool.",/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec22.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec22.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec22.txt,"[ 0 . 8 4 0 9 4 5 1 6 3 1 9 9 5 2 4 1 ,   0 . 8 3 6 0 6 6 4 0 6 6 1 6 6 4 1 7 ,   0 . 8 3 3 8 2 7 4 3 3 3 1 3 5 3 5 7 ]",23,23.02
"23.03 A series of turning tests were conducted using a cemented carbide tool, and flank wear data were collected. The feed was 0.010 in/rev and the depth was 0.125 in. At a speed of 350 ft/min, flank wear = 0.005 in at 1 min, 0.008 in at 5 min, 0.012 in at 11 min, 0.0.015 in at 15 min, 0.021 in at 20 min, and 0.040 in at 25 min. At a speed of 450 ft/min, flank wear = 0.007 in at 1 min, 0.017 in at 5 min, 0.027 in at 9 min, 0.033 in at 11 min, and 0.040 in at 13 min. The last value in each case is when final tool failure occurred. (a) On a single piece of linear graph paper, plot flank wear as a function of time. Using 0.020 in of flank wear as the criterion of tool failure, determine the tool lives for the two cutting speeds. (b) On a piece of natural log-log paper, plot your results determined in the previous part. From the plot, determine the values of n and C in the Taylor Tool Life Equation. (c) As a comparison, calculate the values of n and C in the Taylor equation solving simultaneous equations. Are the resulting n and C values the same?","Solution: (a)  Using the graph, at 350 ft/min the tool last about 6.2 min; at 450 ft/min, it lasts 19.0 min.

C is read from the Y-intercept and is approximately 680 ft/min. The slope, n, can be determined by taking the ln of the x and y &#3; because the Taylor tool life equation is derived assuming the slope is negative. Using the points (1,680) and (19,350) the slope is about 0.226. (c) Depending on the values of tool life read from the flank wear graph, the values of n and C will vary. Two equations: (1) 350(19.0)n = C, and (2) 450(6.2)n = C (1) and (2) 350(19.0)n = 450(6.2)n ln 350 + n ln 19.0 = ln 450 + n ln 6.2 5.8579 + 2.9444 n = 6.1092 + 1.8245 n 1.1199 n = 0.2513 n = 0.224  (1) C = 350(19.0)0.224 = 677  (2) C = 450(6.2)0.224 = 677 C = 677","To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps outlined in the question. Let's break it down into parts (a), (b), and (c).

### Part (a): Plot Flank Wear as a Function of Time and Determine Tool Lives

1. **Data for 350 ft/min:**
   - 1 min: 0.005 in
   - 5 min: 0.008 in
   - 11 min: 0.012 in
   - 15 min: 0.015 in
   - 20 min: 0.021 in
   - 25 min: 0.040 in (failure)

2. **Data for 450 ft/min:**
   - 1 min: 0.007 in
   - 5 min: 0.017 in
   - 9 min: 0.027 in
   - 11 min: 0.033 in
   - 13 min: 0.040 in (failure)

3. **Plotting:**
   - On linear graph paper, plot flank wear (y-axis) against time (x-axis) for both speeds.
   - Draw horizontal line at 0.020 in to represent the tool failure criterion.

4. **Determine Tool Lives:**
   - For 350 ft/min, the tool life is the time at which the wear reaches 0.020 in, which is approximately 19 minutes.
   - For 450 ft/min, the tool life is the time at which the wear reaches 0.020 in, which is approximately 10 minutes.

### Part (b): Plot on Natural Log-Log Paper and Determine n and C

1. **Convert Data:**
   - Convert the tool life data to natural logarithms.
   - ln(Tool Life) for 350 ft/min: ln(19)
   - ln(Tool Life) for 450 ft/min: ln(10)

2. **Plotting:**
   - On natural log-log paper, plot ln(Cutting Speed) (x-axis) against ln(Tool Life) (y-axis).
   - Cutting speeds: 350 ft/min and 450 ft/min.

3. **Determine n and C:**
   - The slope of the line gives the value of \( n \).
   - The intercept on the ln(Cutting Speed) axis gives the value of ln(C), from which C can be calculated.

### Part (c): Calculate n and C Using Simultaneous Equations

1. **Taylor Tool Life Equation:**
   \[
   \nu T^n = C
   \]

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - For 350 ft/min: \( 350 \times 19^n = C \)
   - For 450 ft/min: \( 450 \times 10^n = C \)

3. **Solve Simultaneously:**
   - Divide the two equations to eliminate C:
     \[
     \frac{350 \times 19^n}{450 \times 10^n} = 1
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( n \):
     \[
     \left(\frac{19}{10}\right)^n = \frac{450}{350}
     \]
     \[
     n \ln\left(\frac{19}{10}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{450}{350}\right)
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{450}{350}\right)}{\ln\left(\frac{19}{10}\right)}
     \]

4. **Calculate C:**
   - Substitute \( n \) back into one of the original equations to solve for C.

5. **Comparison:**
   - Compare the values of \( n \) and \( C \) obtained from the plot and the simultaneous equations.

### Final Answer

- **Tool Lives:**
  - 350 ft/min: 19 minutes
  - 450 ft/min: 10 minutes

- **Values of n and C:**
  - From plot: \( n \approx \) (calculated slope), \( C \approx \) (calculated intercept)
  - From equations: \( n \approx \) (calculated value), \( C \approx \) (calculated value)

The values obtained from the plot and the simultaneous equations should be approximately the same, confirming the consistency of the Taylor Tool Life Equation.","If the tool wear curves are plotted for  several different cutting speeds, the results appear as in Figure 22.4. As cutting speed is  increased, wear rate increases so the same level of wear is reached in less time.  

Tool life  is deﬁ  ned as the length of cutting time that the tool can be used. Operat- ing the tool until ﬁ  nal catastrophic failure is one way of deﬁ  ning tool life. This is in- dicated in Figure 22.4 by the end of each tool wear curve. However, in production, it  is often a disadvantage to use the tool until this failure occurs because of difﬁ  culties  in resharpening the tool and problems with work surface quality. As an alternative,  a level of tool wear can be selected as a criterion of tool life, and the tool is replaced  when wear reaches that level. A convenient tool life criterion is a certain ﬂ  ank wear  value, such as $0.5\,\mathrm{mm}\,(0.020\,\mathrm{in})$ , illustrated as the horizontal line on the graph. When  each of the three wear curves intersects that line, the life of the corresponding tool is  deﬁ  ned as ended. If the intersection points are projected down to the time axis, the  values of tool life can be identiﬁ  ed.  

Taylor Tool Life Equation  If the tool life values for the three wear curves in  Figure 22.4 are plotted on a natural log–log graph of cutting speed versus tool life,  the resulting relationship is a straight line as shown in Figure 22.5.  

The discovery of this relationship around 1900 is credited to F. W. Taylor. It can be  expressed in equation form and is called the Taylor tool life equation:  

$$
\nu T^{n}=C
$$

FIGURE 22.5  Natural  log–log plot of cutting  speed vs. tool life.  

where  $\nu=$  cutting speed, $\mathrm{m/min}$   $(\mathrm{ft/min})$ ); $T=$  tool life, min; and $n$  and  $C$  are param- eters whose values depend on feed, depth of cut, work material, tooling (material in  particular), and the tool life criterion used. The value of  $n$  is relative constant for a  given tool material, whereas the value of $C$  depends on tool material, work material,  and cutting conditions.  

Basically, Equation (22.1) states that higher cutting speeds result in shorter tool  lives. Relating the parameters $n$  and  $C$  to Figure 22.5,  $n$  is the slope of the plot (ex- pressed in linear terms rather than in the scale of the axes), and $C$  is the intercept on  the speed axis.  $C$  represents the cutting speed that results in a 1-min tool life.  

The problem with Equation (22.1) is that the units on the right-hand side of the  equation are not consistent with the units on the left-hand side. To make the units  consistent, the equation should be expressed in the form  

$$
\nu T^{n}=C\left(T_{\mathrm{ref}}^{n}\right)
$$  

where  $T_{\mathrm{ref}}=\mathrm{a}$  reference value for  $C$ .  $T_{\mathrm{ref}}$  is simply  $1\;\mathrm{{min}}$  when  $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{min}$  (ft/min) and  minutes are used for  $\nu$  and  $T$ , respectively. The advantage of Equation (22.2) is seen  when it is desired to use the Taylor equation with units other than  $\mathrm{m/min}\ \mathrm{(ft/min)}$   and minutes—for example, if cutting speed were expressed as $\mathrm{m/sec}$  and tool life as  sec. In this case,  $T_{\mathrm{ref}}$  would be $60\;\mathrm{sec}$  and  $C$  would therefore be the same speed value  as in Equation (22.1), although converted to units of  $\mathrm{m/sec}$ . The number of pieces per tool $n_{p}$  is also a function of speed. It can be shown that  

$$
n_{p}={\frac{T}{T_{m}}}
$$  

where  $T=$  tool life, min/tool; and $T_{m}=$  machining time per part, $\mathrm{{min/pc}}$ . Both  $T$ and  $T_{m}$  are functions of speed; hence, the ratio is a function of speed:  

$$
n_{p}={\frac{f C^{1/n}}{\pi D L\nu^{1/n-1}}}
$$  

The effect of this relation is to cause the  $T_{t}/n_{p}$  term in Equation (23.3) to increase  as cutting speed increases. Substituting Equations (21.5) and (23.5) into Equation  (23.3) for  $T_{c}$ ,  

$$
T_{c}=T_{h}+\frac{\pi D L}{f\nu}+\frac{T_{t}(\pi D L\nu^{1/n-1})}{f C^{1/n}}
$$  

The cycle time per piece is a minimum at the cutting speed at which the derivative  of Equation (23.6) is zero:  

$$
\frac{d T_{c}}{d\nu}=0
$$  

Solving this equation yields the cutting speed for maximum production rate in  the operation:  

$$
\nu_{\mathrm{max}}={\frac{C}{\left[\left({\frac{1}{n}}-1\right)T_{t}\right]^{n}}}
$$  

where $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$  is expressed in m/min (ft/min). The corresponding tool life for maximum  production rate is  

$$
T_{\mathrm{max}}=\left({\frac{1}{n}}-1\right)T_{t}
$$  

Minimizing Cost per Unit   For minimum cost per unit, the speed that minimizes  production cost per piece for the operation is determined. To derive the equations  for this case, the four cost components that determine total cost of producing one  part during a turning operation are identiﬁ  ed:  

1.  Cost of part handling time . This is the cost of the time the operator spends load- ing and unloading the part. Let  $C_{o}=$  the cost rate (e.g.,  $\S/\mathrm{min}$ ) for the operator  and machine. Thus the cost of part handling time $=C_{o}T_{h}$ .

 2.  Cost of machining time . This is the cost of the time the tool is engaged in  machining. Using $C_{o}$  again to represent the cost per minute of the operator and  machine tool, the cutting time cos ${\mathfrak{s t}}=C_{o}T_{m}$ .

 3.  Cost of tool change time . The cost of tool change time  $=C_{o}T_{t}/n_{p}$ .

 4.  Tooling cost . In addition to the tool change time, the tool itself has a cost that  must be added to the total operation cost. This cost is the cost per cutting edge  $C_{t},$  divided by the number of pieces machined with that cutting edge  $n_{p}$ . Thus,  tool cost per workpiece is given by  $C_{t}/n_{p}$ .  

Tooling cost requires an explanation, because it is affected by different tooling situa- tions. For disposable inserts (e.g., cemented carbide inserts), tool cost is determined as  

$$
C_{t}=\frac{P_{t}}{n_{e}}
$$  

where $C_{t}=$  cost per cutting edge,  $\S/\mathrm{tcol}$  life;  $P_{t}=$  price of the insert,  $\S/$ insert; and  $n_{e}=$   number of cutting edges per insert. This depends on the insert type; for example, trian- gular inserts that can be used only one side (positive rake tooling) have three edges/ insert; if both sides of the insert can be used (negative rake tooling), there are six edges/ insert; and so forth. Tooling cost requires an explanation, because it is affected by different tooling situa- tions. For disposable inserts (e.g., cemented carbide inserts), tool cost is determined as  

$$
C_{t}=\frac{P_{t}}{n_{e}}
$$  

where $C_{t}=$  cost per cutting edge,  $\S/\mathrm{tcol}$  life;  $P_{t}=$  price of the insert,  $\S/$ insert; and  $n_{e}=$   number of cutting edges per insert. This depends on the insert type; for example, trian- gular inserts that can be used only one side (positive rake tooling) have three edges/ insert; if both sides of the insert can be used (negative rake tooling), there are six edges/ insert; and so forth.  

For regrindable tooling (e.g., high-speed steel solid shank tools, brazed carbide  tools), the tool cost includes purchase price plus cost to regrind:  

$$
C_{t}=\frac{P_{t}}{n_{g}}+\,T_{g}C_{g}
$$  

where  $C_{t}=$  cost per tool life, $\S/$ tool life; $P_{t}=$  purchase price of the solid shank tool or  brazed insert, $\mathbb{S}/\mathrm{cool};n_{g}=$  number of tool lives per tool, which is the number of times  the tool can be ground before it can no longer be used (5–10 times for roughing tools  and 10–20 times for ﬁ  nishing tools);  $T_{g}=$  time to grind or regrind the tool, min/tool  life; and  $C_{g}=$  grinder’s rate, $\S/\mathrm{min}$ .  

The sum of the four cost components gives the total cost per unit product  $C_{c}$  for  the machining cycle:  

$$
C_{c}=C_{o}T_{h}+C_{o}T_{m}+\frac{C_{o}T_{t}}{n_{p}}+\frac{C_{t}}{n_{p}}
$$  

$C_{c}$  is a function of cutting speed, just as $T_{c}$  is a function of  $\nu$ . The relationships for the  individual terms and total cost as a function of cutting speed are shown in Figure 23.4.  Equation (23.11) can be rewritten in terms of  $\nu$  to yield:  

$$
C_{c}=C_{o}T_{h}+\frac{C_{o}\pi D L}{f\nu}+\frac{(C_{o}T_{t}+C_{t})(\pi D L\nu^{1/n-1})}{f C^{1/n}}
$$  

The cutting speed that obtains minimum cost per piece for the operation can be  determined by taking the derivative of Equation (23.12) with respect to  $\nu$ , setting it  to zero, and solving for $\nu_{\mathrm{min}}$ :  

$$
\nu_{\mathrm{min}}=C\bigg(\frac{n}{1-n}\cdot\frac{C_{o}}{C_{o}T_{t}+C_{t}}\bigg)^{n}
$$

The corresponding tool life is given by  

$$
T_{\mathrm{min}}=\left(\frac{1}{n}-1\right)\left(\frac{C_{o}T_{t}+C_{t}}{C_{o}}\right)
$$

\[
\nu T^{n} = C
\]

where:
- \(\nu\) is the cutting speed,
- \(T\) is the tool life,
- \(n\) and \(C\) are parameters that depend on the cutting conditions and materials.

The problem states that the tool life criterion is 0.50 mm of flank land wear. This means that we need to determine the tool life \(T\) when the flank wear reaches 0.50 mm.

### Steps to Solve the Problem:

1. **Understand the Context**: The Taylor Tool Life Equation relates cutting speed and tool life. The parameters \(n\) and \(C\) are specific to the tool material, work material, and cutting conditions.

2. **Identify Given Values**: 
   - We are not given specific values for \(\nu\), \(n\), or \(C\) in the problem statement. These would typically be provided in a specific problem or derived from experimental data.

3. **Assume or Derive Necessary Values**:
   - Since the problem does not provide specific values, we must assume or derive them from a similar problem (Problem 23.1) or from experimental data.
   - For the sake of this exercise, let's assume hypothetical values for \(n\) and \(C\) based on typical scenarios. Let's assume \(n = 0.25\) and \(C = 300\).

4. **Calculate Tool Life for 0.50 mm Flank Wear**:
   - If we had the cutting speed \(\nu\), we could rearrange the Taylor equation to solve for \(T\):
   \[
   T = \left(\frac{C}{\nu}\right)^{1/n}
   \]
   - Without specific values for \(\nu\), we cannot calculate an exact numerical answer. However, the relationship indicates that as \(\nu\) increases, \(T\) decreases.

5. **Comparison with 0.75 mm Criterion**:
   - If we had data for a 0.75 mm criterion, we could compare the tool life for 0.50 mm and 0.75 mm flank wear. Generally, a lower wear criterion (0.50 mm) would result in a shorter tool life compared to a higher wear criterion (0.75 mm) for the same cutting speed.

### Conclusion:

Without specific numerical values for \(\nu\), \(n\), and \(C\), we cannot provide a precise numerical answer. However, the Taylor Tool Life Equation provides a framework to understand how tool life changes with cutting speed and wear criteria. If specific values were provided, we could calculate the tool life for the 0.50 mm flank wear criterion using the equation.

If you have specific values from Problem 23.1 or any additional data, please provide them, and I can help calculate the exact tool life.","If the tool wear curves are plotted for  several different cutting speeds, the results appear as in Figure 22.4. As cutting speed is  increased, wear rate increases so the same level of wear is reached in less time.  

Tool life  is deﬁ  ned as the length of cutting time that the tool can be used. Operat- ing the tool until ﬁ  nal catastrophic failure is one way of deﬁ  ning tool life. This is in- dicated in Figure 22.4 by the end of each tool wear curve. However, in production, it  is often a disadvantage to use the tool until this failure occurs because of difﬁ  culties  in resharpening the tool and problems with work surface quality. As an alternative,  a level of tool wear can be selected as a criterion of tool life, and the tool is replaced  when wear reaches that level. A convenient tool life criterion is a certain ﬂ  ank wear  value, such as $0.5\,\mathrm{mm}\,(0.020\,\mathrm{in})$ , illustrated as the horizontal line on the graph. When  each of the three wear curves intersects that line, the life of the corresponding tool is  deﬁ  ned as ended. If the intersection points are projected down to the time axis, the  values of tool life can be identiﬁ  ed.  

Taylor Tool Life Equation  If the tool life values for the three wear curves in  Figure 22.4 are plotted on a natural log–log graph of cutting speed versus tool life,  the resulting relationship is a straight line as shown in Figure 22.5.  

The discovery of this relationship around 1900 is credited to F. W. Taylor. It can be  expressed in equation form and is called the Taylor tool life equation:  

$$
\nu T^{n}=C
$$

where  $\nu=$  cutting speed, $\mathrm{m/min}$   $(\mathrm{ft/min})$ ); $T=$  tool life, min; and $n$  and  $C$  are param- eters whose values depend on feed, depth of cut, work material, tooling (material in  particular), and the tool life criterion used. The value of  $n$  is relative constant for a  given tool material, whereas the value of $C$  depends on tool material, work material,  and cutting conditions.  

Basically, Equation (22.1) states that higher cutting speeds result in shorter tool  lives. Relating the parameters $n$  and  $C$  to Figure 22.5,  $n$  is the slope of the plot (ex- pressed in linear terms rather than in the scale of the axes), and $C$  is the intercept on  the speed axis.  $C$  represents the cutting speed that results in a 1-min tool life.  

The problem with Equation (22.1) is that the units on the right-hand side of the  equation are not consistent with the units on the left-hand side. To make the units  consistent, the equation should be expressed in the form  

$$
\nu T^{n}=C\left(T_{\mathrm{ref}}^{n}\right)
$$  

where  $T_{\mathrm{ref}}=\mathrm{a}$  reference value for  $C$ .  $T_{\mathrm{ref}}$  is simply  $1\;\mathrm{{min}}$  when  $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{min}$  (ft/min) and  minutes are used for  $\nu$  and  $T$ , respectively. The advantage of Equation (22.2) is seen  when it is desired to use the Taylor equation with units other than  $\mathrm{m/min}\ \mathrm{(ft/min)}$   and minutes—for example, if cutting speed were expressed as $\mathrm{m/sec}$  and tool life as  sec. In this case,  $T_{\mathrm{ref}}$  would be $60\;\mathrm{sec}$  and  $C$  would therefore be the same speed value  as in Equation (22.1), although converted to units of  $\mathrm{m/sec}$ . Accordingly, two main types of tool wear can be distinguished: crater  wear and ﬂ  ank wear, illustrated in Figures 22.1 and 22.2. A single-point tool is used to  explain tool wear and the mechanisms that cause it.  Crater wear , Figure 22.2(a), con- sists of a cavity in the rake face of the tool that forms and grows from the action of the  chip sliding against the surface. High stresses and temperatures characterize the tool– chip contact interface, contributing to the wearing action. The crater can be measured  either by its depth or its area.  Flank wear , Figure 22.2(b), occurs on the ﬂ  ank, or relief  face, of the tool. It results from rubbing between the newly generated work surface  and the ﬂ  ank face adjacent to the cutting edge. Flank wear is measured by the width of  the wear band, FW. This wear band is sometimes called the ﬂ  ank wear  land .  

Certain features of ﬂ  ank wear can be identiﬁ  ed. First, an extreme condition of  ﬂ  ank wear often appears on the cutting edge at the location corresponding to the  original surface of the work part. This is called  notch wear . It occurs because the  original work surface is harder and/or more abrasive than the internal material,  which could be caused by work hardening from cold drawing or previous machining,  sand particles in the surface from casting, or other reasons. As a consequence of the  harder surface, wear is accelerated at this location. A second region of ﬂ  ank wear  that can be identiﬁ  ed is  nose radius wear ; this occurs on the nose radius leading into  the end cutting edge.

The mechanisms that cause wear at the tool–chip and tool–work interfaces in  machining can be summarized as follows:  

➢   Abrasion . This is a mechanical wearing action caused by hard particles in the work  material gouging and removing small portions of the tool. This abrasive action  occurs in both ﬂ  ank wear and crater wear; it is a signiﬁ  cant cause of ﬂ  ank wear.

 ➢   Adhesion . When two metals are forced into contact under high pressure and  temperature, adhesion (welding) occurs between them. These conditions are  present between the chip and the rake face of the tool. As the chip ﬂ  ows across  the tool, small particles of the tool adhere to the chip and are broken away from  the surface, resulting in attrition of the surface.  

Diffusion . This is a process in which an exchange of atoms takes place across  a close contact boundary between two materials (Section 4.3). In the case of  tool wear, diffusion occurs at the tool–chip boundary, causing the tool surface  to become depleted of the atoms responsible for its hardness. As this process  continues, the tool surface becomes more susceptible to abrasion and adhesion.  Diffusion is believed to be a principal mechanism of crater wear.  

Chemical reactions . The high temperatures and clean surfaces at the tool–chip  interface in machining at high speeds can result in chemical reactions, in particu- lar, oxidation, on the rake face of the tool. The oxidized layer, being softer than  the parent tool material, is sheared away, exposing new material to sustain the  reaction process.  

Plastic deformation . Another mechanism that contributes to tool wear is plastic  deformation of the cutting edge. The cutting forces acting on the cutting edge at  high temperature cause the edge to deform plastically, making it more vulnerable  to abrasion of the tool surface. 22 22  

# Cutting-Tool  Cutting-Tool  Technology Technology  

Machining operations are accomplished using cutting  tools. The high forces and temperatures during ma- chining create a very harsh environment for the tool.  If   cutting force becomes too high, the tool fractures. If  cutting temperature becomes too high, the tool materi- al softens and fails. If neither of these conditions causes  the tool to fail, continual wear of the cutting edge ulti- mately leads to failure.

22.1.1 Tool Wear 22.1.2 Tool Life and the Taylor Tool  Life Equation  

Cutting tool technology has two principal aspects:  tool material and tool geometry. The ﬁ  rst is concerned  with developing materials that can withstand the   forces,  temperatures, and wearing action in the machining  process. The second deals with optimizing the geometry  of the cutting tool for the tool material and for a given  operation. It is appropriate to begin by considering tool  life, because this is a prerequisite for much of the subse- quent discussion on tool materials. It also seems appro- priate to include a section on cutting ﬂ  uids at the end of  this chapter; cutting ﬂ  uids are often used in machining  operations to prolong the life of a cutting tool.

# 22.4 Cutting Fluids  

As suggested by the opening paragraph, there are  three possible modes by which a cutting tool can fail in  machining:  

22.4.1 Types of Cutting Fluids 22.4.2 Application of Cutting Fluids  

1.  Fracture failure . This mode of failure occurs when  the cutting force at the tool point becomes exces- sive, causing it to fail suddenly by brittle fracture.

 2.  Temperature failure . This failure occurs when the  cutting temperature is too high for the tool mate- rial, causing the material at the tool point to soften,  which leads to plastic deformation and loss of the  sharp edge.

 3.  Gradual wear . Gradual wearing of the cutting  edge causes loss of tool shape, reduction in cutting  efﬁ  ciency, an acceleration of wearing as the tool  becomes heavily worn, and ﬁ  nally tool failure in a  manner similar to a temperature failure. Fracture and temperature failures result in premature loss of the cutting tool.  

These two modes of failure are therefore undesirable. Of the three possible tool  failures, gradual wear is preferred because it leads to the longest possible use of the  tool, with the associated economic advantage of that longer use.  

Product quality must also be considered when attempting to control the mode of  tool failure. When the tool point fails suddenly during a cut, it often causes damage  to the work surface. This damage requires either rework of the surface or possible  scrapping of the part. The damage can be avoided by selecting cutting conditions  that favor gradual wearing of the tool rather than fracture or temperature failure,  and by changing the tool before the ﬁ  nal catastrophic loss of the cutting edge occurs.  

# 22.1.1  TOOL WEAR  

Gradual wear occurs at two principal locations on a cutting tool: the top rake face  and the ﬂ  ank. Accordingly, two main types of tool wear can be distinguished: crater  wear and ﬂ  ank wear, illustrated in Figures 22.1 and 22.2. A single-point tool is used to  explain tool wear and the mechanisms that cause it.  Crater wear , Figure 22.2(a), con- sists of a cavity in the rake face of the tool that forms and grows from the action of the  chip sliding against the surface. High stresses and temperatures characterize the tool– chip contact interface, contributing to the wearing action. The crater can be measured  either by its depth or its area.  Flank wear , Figure 22.2(b), occurs on the ﬂ  ank, or relief  face, of the tool.",/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec22.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec22.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec22.txt,"[ 0 . 8 4 0 9 4 5 1 6 3 1 9 9 5 2 3 3 ,   0 . 8 3 6 0 6 6 4 0 6 6 1 6 6 4 1 7 ,   0 . 8 3 3 8 2 7 4 3 3 3 1 3 5 3 6 ]",23,23.02

" A tensile test uses a test specimen that has a gage length of 50 mm and an area = 200 mm2. During the test the specimen yields under a load of 98,000 N. The corresponding gage length = 50.23 mm. 
This is the 0.2 percent yield point. The maximum load of 168,000 N is reached at a gage length = 
64.2 mm. D. Determine (a) yield strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, and (c) tensile strength. ","Solution: (a) Y = 98,000/200 = 490 MPa. (b) s = E e Subtracting the 0.2% offset, e = (50.23 -50.0)/50.0 -0.002 = 0.0026 E = s/e = 490/0.0026 = 188.5 x 103 MPa.  (c) TS = 168,000/200 = 840 MPa.  ","To solve the given problem, we need to determine the yield strength, modulus of elasticity, and tensile strength based on the provided data from a tensile test. Let's go through each part step by step:

### Given Data:
- Original gage length, \( L_o = 50 \, \text{mm} \)
- Original cross-sectional area, \( A_o = 200 \, \text{mm}^2 \)
- Load at yield point, \( F_y = 98,000 \, \text{N} \)
- Gage length at yield point, \( L_y = 50.23 \, \text{mm} \)
- Maximum load, \( F_{\text{max}} = 168,000 \, \text{N} \)
- Gage length at maximum load, \( L_{\text{max}} = 64.2 \, \text{mm} \)

### (a) Yield Strength
The yield strength is calculated using the load at the yield point and the original cross-sectional area. The formula for yield strength (\( Y \)) is:

\[
Y = \frac{F_y}{A_o}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
Y = \frac{98,000 \, \text{N}}{200 \, \text{mm}^2} = 490 \, \text{MPa}
\]

### (b) Modulus of Elasticity
The modulus of elasticity (\( E \)) is determined using the yield strength and the engineering strain at the yield point. The engineering strain (\( e \)) at the yield point is calculated as:

\[
e = \frac{L_y - L_o}{L_o} = \frac{50.23 \, \text{mm} - 50 \, \text{mm}}{50 \, \text{mm}} = 0.0046
\]

Since the yield point is defined at a 0.2% offset, we need to subtract this offset from the calculated strain:

\[
e_{\text{corrected}} = 0.0046 - 0.002 = 0.0026
\]

Now, using Hooke's Law (\( s = Ee \)), we can rearrange to find \( E \):

\[
E = \frac{Y}{e_{\text{corrected}}} = \frac{490 \, \text{MPa}}{0.0026} = 188,461.54 \, \text{MPa}
\]

### (c) Tensile Strength
The tensile strength (\( TS \)) is calculated using the maximum load and the original cross-sectional area. The formula for tensile strength is:

\[
TS = \frac{F_{\text{max}}}{A_o}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
TS = \frac{168,000 \, \text{N}}{200 \, \text{mm}^2} = 840 \, \text{MPa}
\]

### Final Answers:
- (a) Yield Strength: \( 490 \, \text{MPa} \)
- (b) Modulus of Elasticity: \( 188,461.54 \, \text{MPa} \)
- (c) Tensile Strength: \( 840 \, \text{MPa} \)","During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}.

$ (b) Subtracting the $0.2\%$  offset, engineering strain  $e=(50.2-50.0)/50.0\;-

 (c) Tensile strength $=$  maximum load divided by original area:

 (d) By Equation (3.2), engineering strain at maximum load  $e=$  

 $(57.7-50)/50={\bf0.154}$ .

 (e) Deﬁ  ned in Equation (3.4), percent elongation $E L=(59.5-50)/50=$  

 $\mathbf{0.19}=\mathbf{19\%}$ .  

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the  

! To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

metallic test specimens and the associated nonuniform effect on elongation and area  reduction. Despite these difﬁ  culties, percent elongation and percent area reduction  are the most commonly used measures of ductility in engineering practice. Some  typical values of percent elongation for various materials (mostly metals) are listed  in Table 3.3.  

# Example 3.1  Engineering  stress and strain  

A tensile test specimen has a starting gage length $=50\:\mathrm{mm}$  and a cross-sectional  area $=200\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ . During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}. ![](images/d9e12c60253897fff622ef840f4c9f7918425434d2680004cdc9b82d613eb271.jpg)  
FIGURE 3.2  Typical  progress of a tensile  test: (1) beginning of  test, no load; (2) uniform  elongation and reduc- tion of cross-sectional  area; (3) continued  elongation, maximum  load reached; (4) neck- ing begins, load begins  to decrease; and (5)  fracture. If pieces are  put back together as in  (6), ﬁ  nal length can be  measured.  

The load and the change in length of the specimen are recorded as testing proceeds,  to provide the data required to determine the stress–strain relationship. There are  two different types of stress–strain curves: (1) engineering stress–strain and (2) true  stress–strain. The ﬁ  rst is more important in design, and the second is more important  in manufacturing.  

Engineering Stress–strain   The engineering stress and strain in a tensile test are  deﬁ  ned relative to the original area and length of the test specimen. These values are  of interest in design because the designer expects that the strains experienced by any  component of the product will not signiﬁ  cantly change its shape. The components  are designed to withstand the anticipated stresses encountered in service.  

A typical engineering stress–strain curve from a tensile test of a metallic speci- men is illustrated in Figure 3.3. The  engineering stress  at any point on the curve is  deﬁ  ned as the force divided by the original area:  

$$
s=\frac{F}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $s=$  engineering stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ );  $F=$  applied force in the test, $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A_{o}=$  original area of the test specimen,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}$   $(\mathrm{in}^{2}]$ ). The  engineering strain  at any  point in the test is given by  

$$
e=\frac{L-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $e\:=\:$  engineering strain,  $\mathrm{mm/mm~(in/in)}$ ;  $L=$ length at any point during the  elongation, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and $L_{o}=$  original gage length, mm (in). The units of engineer- ing strain are given as $\mathrm{mm/mm}$  (in/in), but think of it as representing elongation per  unit length, without units.  

The stress–strain relationship in Figure 3.3 has two regions, indicating two dis- tinct forms of behavior: (1) elastic and (2) plastic. In the elastic region, the relation- ship between stress and strain is linear, and the material exhibits elastic behavior by  

![](images/d0bec5dc14bfbf80832d78675a36196cfd2800b33ec74d7a6c30553b276140c2.jpg)  

returning to its original length when the load (stress) is released. The relationship is  deﬁ  ned by  Hooke’s law :  

$$
s=E e
$$  

where  $E=$   modulus of elasticity  (also known as  Young’s modulus ), MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ,  a measure of the inherent stiffness of a material. It is a constant of proportionality  whose value is different for different materials. Table 3.1 presents typical values for  several materials, metals and nonmetals.  

As stress increases, some point in the linear relationship is ﬁ  nally reached at  which the material begins to yield. This  yield point   $Y$ of the material can be identi- ﬁ  ed in the ﬁ  gure by the change in slope at the end of the linear region. Because the  start of yielding is usually difﬁ  cult to see in a plot of test data (it does not usually oc- cur as an abrupt change in slope), $Y$  is typically deﬁ  ned as the stress at which a strain  offset of  $0.2\%$  from the straight line has occurred.",/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt,"[ 0 . 9 0 3 8 6 4 7 0 7 7 5 1 3 4 6 8 ,   0 . 8 8 7 8 6 6 1 3 6 5 7 2 5 6 6 7 ,   0 . 8 6 7 8 7 6 0 3 0 1 2 2 9 6 9 9 ]",3.0,3.01

- Gage length at fracture, \( L_f = 2.92 \, \text{in} \)
- Final cross-sectional area, \( A_f = 0.25 \, \text{in}^2 \)

### (a) Yield Strength
Yield strength is calculated using the formula:
\[
Y = \frac{F_y}{A_o}
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
Y = \frac{32,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} = 64,000 \, \text{psi}

Using Hooke's Law, \( s = Ee \), where \( s \) is the stress at yield:
\[
E = \frac{Y}{e_y} = \frac{64,000 \, \text{psi}}{0.00415} \approx 15,421,686 \, \text{psi}
\]

### (c) Tensile Strength
Tensile strength is calculated using the maximum load:
\[
TS = \frac{F_{\text{max}}}{A_o}
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
TS = \frac{60,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} = 120,000 \, \text{psi}
\]

### (d) Percent Elongation
Percent elongation is calculated using the formula:
\[
EL = \frac{L_f - L_o}{L_o} \times 100\%
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
EL = \frac{2.92 \, \text{in} - 2.0 \, \text{in}}{2.0 \, \text{in}} \times 100\% = 46\%
\]

### (e) Percent Reduction in Area
Percent reduction in area is calculated using the formula:
\[
AR = \frac{A_o - A_f}{A_o} \times 100\%
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
AR = \frac{0.5 \, \text{in}^2 - 0.25 \, \text{in}^2}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} \times 100\% = 50\%

The stress–strain relationship in Figure 3.3 has two regions, indicating two dis- tinct forms of behavior: (1) elastic and (2) plastic. In the elastic region, the relation- ship between stress and strain is linear, and the material exhibits elastic behavior by

As stress increases, some point in the linear relationship is ﬁ  nally reached at  which the material begins to yield. This  yield point   $Y$ of the material can be identi- ﬁ  ed in the ﬁ  gure by the change in slope at the end of the linear region.

Let's go through each step:

### Step 1: Calculate Engineering Stress and Strain

**Engineering Stress (\(s\))** is calculated using the formula:
\[ s = \frac{F}{A_o} \]
where \( F \) is the force and \( A_o \) is the original cross-sectional area.

**Engineering Strain (\(e\))** is calculated using the formula:
\[ e = \frac{L - L_o}{L_o} \]
where \( L \) is the current gage length and \( L_o \) is the original gage length.

Given:
- Original gage length (\(L_o\)) = 125.0 mm
- Original cross-sectional area (\(A_o\)) = 62.5 mm²

Let's calculate the engineering stress and strain for each data point:

1. **Data Point 1:**
   - Force (\(F\)) = 17,793 N
   - Gage length (\(L\)) = 125.23 mm

   \[
   s_1 = \frac{17,793}{62.5} = 284.688 \, \text{MPa}
   \]

   \[
   e_1 = \frac{125.23 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.00184
   \]

2. **Data Point 2:**
   - Force (\(F\)) = 23,042 N
   - Gage length (\(L\)) = 131.25 mm

   \[
   s_2 = \frac{23,042}{62.5} = 368.672 \, \text{MPa}
   \]

   \[
   e_2 = \frac{131.25 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.050
   \]

3. **Data Point 3:**
   - Force (\(F\)) = 27,579 N
   - Gage length (\(L\)) = 140.05 mm

   \[
   s_3 = \frac{27,579}{62.5} = 441.264 \, \text{MPa}
   \]

   \[
   e_3 = \frac{140.05 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.1204
   \]

4. **Data Point 4:**
   - Force (\(F\)) = 28,913 N
   - Gage length (\(L\)) = 147.01 mm

   \[
   s_4 = \frac{28,913}{62.5} = 462.608 \, \text{MPa}
   \]

   \[
   e_4 = \frac{147.01 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.17608
   \]

5. **Data Point 5:**
   - Force (\(F\)) = 27,578 N
   - Gage length (\(L\)) = 153.00 mm

   \[
   s_5 = \frac{27,578}{62.5} = 441.248 \, \text{MPa}
   \]

   \[
   e_5 = \frac{153.00 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.224
   \]

6. **Data Point 6:**
   - Force (\(F\)) = 20,462 N
   - Gage length (\(L\)) = 160.10 mm

   \[
   s_6 = \frac{20,462}{62.5} = 327.392 \, \text{MPa}
   \]

   \[
   e_6 = \frac{160.10 - 125.0}{125.0} = 0.2808
   \]

### Step 2: Plot the Engineering Stress-Strain Curve

Using the calculated stress and strain values, plot the engineering stress-strain curve with strain on the x-axis and stress on the y-axis.

### Step 3: Determine Yield Strength, Modulus of Elasticity, and Tensile Strength

**(b) Yield Strength:**
- The yield strength is typically determined using the 0.2% offset method. However, since the data does not provide a clear yield point, we assume the first data point as the yield point for simplicity.
- Yield Strength = \( s_1 = 284.688 \, \text{MPa} \)

**(c) Modulus of Elasticity (\(E\)):**
- Modulus of Elasticity is the slope of the initial linear portion of the stress-strain curve.
- Using the first two data points for calculation:
  \[
  E = \frac{s_2 - s_1}{e_2 - e_1} = \frac{368.672 - 284.688}{0.050 - 0.00184} = 1,707.68 \, \text{MPa}
  \]

**(d) Tensile Strength:**
- Tensile Strength is the maximum stress on the engineering stress-strain curve.
- Tensile Strength = \( s_4 = 462.608 \, \text{MPa} \)

### Final Answers:
- **Yield Strength:** 284.688 MPa
- **Modulus of Elasticity:** 1,707.68 MPa
- **Tensile Strength:** 462.608 MPa","During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}.

$ (b) Subtracting the $0.2\%$  offset, engineering strain  $e=(50.2-50.0)/50.0\;-

$ $0.002=0.002$ Rearranging Equation (3.3), modulus of elasticity  $E=s/e=160/0.002=$  

 $\mathbf{80,000\,M P a}$ .

 (c) Tensile strength $=$  maximum load divided by original area: 

 ${\cal T}S=65{,}000/200=325~\mathrm{M}\mathrm{Pa}$ .

 (d) By Equation (3.2), engineering strain at maximum load  $e=$  

 $(57.7-50)/50={\bf0.154}$ .

 (e) Deﬁ  ned in Equation (3.4), percent elongation $E L=(59.5-50)/50=$  

 $\mathbf{0.19}=\mathbf{19\%}$ .  

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the  

! To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in  

TABLE  •  3.3  Ductility as % elongation (typical values) for various selected materials.

For alloys, there is a range of ductility that depends on composition and treatment (e.g., heat treatment,  degree of work hardening). b Ceramic materials are brittle; they withstand elastic strain but virtually no plastic strain. c Elastomers endure signiﬁ  cant elastic strain, but their plastic strain is very limited, only around  $1\%$  being typical.  

metallic test specimens and the associated nonuniform effect on elongation and area  reduction. Despite these difﬁ  culties, percent elongation and percent area reduction  are the most commonly used measures of ductility in engineering practice. Some  typical values of percent elongation for various materials (mostly metals) are listed  in Table 3.3.  

# Example 3.1  Engineering  stress and strain  

A tensile test specimen has a starting gage length $=50\:\mathrm{mm}$  and a cross-sectional  area $=200\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ . During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ .

If pieces are  put back together as in  (6), ﬁ  nal length can be  measured.  

The load and the change in length of the specimen are recorded as testing proceeds,  to provide the data required to determine the stress–strain relationship. There are  two different types of stress–strain curves: (1) engineering stress–strain and (2) true  stress–strain. The ﬁ  rst is more important in design, and the second is more important  in manufacturing.  

Engineering Stress–strain   The engineering stress and strain in a tensile test are  deﬁ  ned relative to the original area and length of the test specimen. These values are  of interest in design because the designer expects that the strains experienced by any  component of the product will not signiﬁ  cantly change its shape. The components  are designed to withstand the anticipated stresses encountered in service.  

A typical engineering stress–strain curve from a tensile test of a metallic speci- men is illustrated in Figure 3.3. The  engineering stress  at any point on the curve is  deﬁ  ned as the force divided by the original area:  

$$
s=\frac{F}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $s=$  engineering stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ );  $F=$  applied force in the test, $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A_{o}=$  original area of the test specimen,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}$   $(\mathrm{in}^{2}]$ ). The  engineering strain  at any  point in the test is given by  

$$
e=\frac{L-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $e\:=\:$  engineering strain,  $\mathrm{mm/mm~(in/in)}$ ;  $L=$ length at any point during the  elongation, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and $L_{o}=$  original gage length, mm (in). The units of engineer- ing strain are given as $\mathrm{mm/mm}$  (in/in), but think of it as representing elongation per  unit length, without units.  

The stress–strain relationship in Figure 3.3 has two regions, indicating two dis- tinct forms of behavior: (1) elastic and (2) plastic. In the elastic region, the relation- ship between stress and strain is linear, and the material exhibits elastic behavior by

returning to its original length when the load (stress) is released. The relationship is  deﬁ  ned by  Hooke’s law :  

$$

where  $E=$   modulus of elasticity  (also known as  Young’s modulus ), MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ,  a measure of the inherent stiffness of a material. It is a constant of proportionality  whose value is different for different materials. Table 3.1 presents typical values for  several materials, metals and nonmetals.  

As stress increases, some point in the linear relationship is ﬁ  nally reached at  which the material begins to yield. This  yield point   $Y$ of the material can be identi- ﬁ  ed in the ﬁ  gure by the change in slope at the end of the linear region. Because the  start of yielding is usually difﬁ  cult to see in a plot of test data (it does not usually oc- cur as an abrupt change in slope), $Y$  is typically deﬁ  ned as the stress at which a strain  offset of  $0.2\%$  from the straight line has occurred.",/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt,"[ 0 . 9 1 9 4 9 0 9 4 8 4 5 1 0 1 8 8 ,   0 . 9 0 6 1 2 8 5 0 4 3 7 4 7 0 3 9 ,   0 . 9 0 0 8 4 7 1 2 3 4 8 5 0 4 4 8 ]",3.0,3.03
A tensile test for a certain metal provides flow curve parameters: strain-hardening exponent is 0.3 and strength coefficient is 600 MPa. Determine (a) the flow stress at a true strain = 1.0 and (b) true strain at a flow stress = 600 MPa.,Solution: (a) Yf = 600(1.0)^.3 = 600 MPa (b) H = (600/600)^(1/.3) = (1.0)^3.33 = 1.00,"To solve the given problem, we will use the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = K \epsilon^n
\]

where:
- \(\sigma\) is the true stress,
- \(K\) is the strength coefficient,
- \(\epsilon\) is the true strain, and
- \(n\) is the strain-hardening exponent.

Given:
- \(K = 600 \, \text{MPa}\)
- \(n = 0.3\)

### (a) Determine the flow stress at a true strain \(\epsilon = 1.0\).

Using the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = 600 \times (1.0)^{0.3}
\]

Since \((1.0)^{0.3} = 1\), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\sigma = 600 \, \text{MPa}
\]

Thus, the flow stress at a true strain of 1.0 is \(600 \, \text{MPa}\).

### (b) Determine the true strain at a flow stress \(\sigma = 600 \, \text{MPa}\).

Using the flow curve equation again:

\[
600 = 600 \times \epsilon^{0.3}
\]

Divide both sides by 600:

\[
1 = \epsilon^{0.3}
\]

To solve for \(\epsilon\), raise both sides to the power of \(\frac{1}{0.3}\):

\[
\epsilon = 1^{\frac{1}{0.3}} = 1
\]

Thus, the true strain at a flow stress of \(600 \, \text{MPa}\) is \(1.0\).

### Final Answers:
(a) The flow stress at a true strain of 1.0 is \(600 \, \text{MPa}\).

(b) The true strain at a flow stress of \(600 \, \text{MPa}\) is \(1.0\).","Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.  

![](images/2568ff5aca665b9fc84e7b1a562fccf1c25a27242085edc83566c161baa241a7.jpg)  
FIGURE 3.5  True stress–strain  curve plotted on log–log scale.  

Because it is a straight line in this transformation of the data, the relationship  between true stress and true strain in the plastic region can be expressed as  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

This equation is called the  ﬂ  ow curve , and it provides a good approximation of the  behavior of metals in the plastic region, including their capacity for strain hardening.  The constant $K$  is called the  strength coefﬁ  cient , MPa  $(1{\mathrm{b}}/{\mathrm{in}}^{2}),$  and it equals the value  of true stress at a true strain value equal to one. The parameter  $n$  is called the  strain  hardening exponent , and it is the slope of the line in Figure 3.5. Its value is directly  related to a metal’s tendency to work harden. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for selected  metals are given in Table 3.4.

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine the strength coefﬁ  cient and  strain hardening exponent in the ﬂ  ow curve equation: $\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}$ .  

Solution:  We have two points on the ﬂ  ow curve from which the ﬂ  ow curve  parameters can be determined: (1) at the yield point and (2) at the maximum  load.  

(1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ . (1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ .  

Solving for $n$  and $K$ ,  

(1) $K=160/(0.001998)^{n}$  and (2) $K=375/(0.143)^{n}$   $160/(0.001998)^{n}=375/(0.143)^{n}$  

 $\ln(160)-n\ln(0.001998)=\ln(375)-n\ln(0.143$  ln(0.143)

 $5.0752-(-6.2156)n=5.9269-(-1.9449)n

$ $5.0752+6.2156n=5.9269+1.9449n

$ $(6.2156-1.9449)n=5.9269-5.0752

Check:  Using (2):  $K=375/(0.143)^{0.1994}=552.7.$  

The ﬂ  ow curve equation is $\sigma={\tt552.7}\epsilon^{\tt0.1994}$ .  

Necking in a tensile test and in metal forming operations that stretch the work  part is closely related to strain hardening. As the test specimen is elongated during  the initial part of the test (before necking begins), uniform straining occurs through- out the length because if any element in the specimen becomes strained more than  the surrounding metal, its strength increases by work hardening, thus making it  more resistant to additional strain until the surrounding metal has been strained  an equal amount. Finally, the strain becomes so large that uniform straining cannot  be sustained. A weak point in the length develops (from buildup of dislocations at  grain boundaries, impurities in the metal, or other factors), and necking is initiated,  leading to failure. Empirical evidence reveals that necking begins for a particular  metal when the true strain reaches a value equal to the strain-hardening exponent $n$ .  Therefore, a higher $n$  value means that the metal can be strained further before the  onset of necking during tensile loading.  

Types of Stress–Strain Relationships  Much information about elastic–plastic  behavior is provided by the true stress–strain curve. As indicated, Hooke’s law  ( $\mathit{(\sigma=E\epsilon)}$ ) governs the metal’s behavior in the elastic region, and the ﬂ  ow curve

$(\sigma\,=\,K\epsilon^{n})$ ) determines the behavior in the plastic region. Three basic forms of  stress–strain relationship describe the behavior of nearly all types of solid materi- als, shown in Figure 3.6:  

(a)  Perfectly elastic . The behavior of this material is deﬁ  ned completely by its stiff- ness, indicated by the modulus of elasticity  $\mathcal{L}$ . It fractures rather than yielding  to plastic ﬂ  ow. Brittle materials such as ceramics, many cast irons, and thermo- setting polymers possess stress–strain curves that fall into this category. The typical stress–strain relationship for a metal exhibits elasticity below the  yield point and strain hardening above it. Figures 3.4 and 3.5 indicate this behavior  in linear and logarithmic axes. In the plastic region, the metal’s behavior is expressed  by the ﬂ  ow curve:  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

where $K=$  the strength coefﬁ  cient, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ; and $n$  is the strain hardening expo- nent. The stress  $\sigma$  and strain  $\epsilon$  in the ﬂ  ow curve are true stress and true strain. The  ﬂ  ow curve is generally valid as a relationship that deﬁ  nes a metal’s plastic behavior  in cold working. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for different metals at room temperature  are listed in Table 3.4.  

Flow Stress  The ﬂ  ow curve describes the stress–strain relationship in the region  in which metal forming takes place. It indicates the ﬂ  ow stress of the metal—the  strength property that determines forces and power required to accomplish a par- ticular forming operation. For most metals at room temperature, the stress–strain  plot of Figure 3.5 indicates that as the metal is deformed, its strength increases  due to strain hardening. The stress required to continue deformation must be  increased to match this increase in strength.  Flow stress  is deﬁ  ned as the instan- taneous value of stress required to continue deforming the material—to keep the  metal “ﬂ  owing.” It is the yield strength of the metal as a function of strain, which  can be expressed:  

$$
Y_{f}=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

where  $Y_{f}=$  ﬂ  ow stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ .  

In the individual forming operations discussed in the following two chapters, the  instantaneous ﬂ  ow stress can be used to analyze the process as it is occurring. For  example, in certain forging operations, the instantaneous force during compression  can be determined from the ﬂ  ow stress value. Maximum force can be calculated  based on the ﬂ  ow stress that results from the ﬁ  nal strain at the end of the forging  stroke.  

In other cases, the analysis is based on the average stresses and strains that occur  during deformation rather than instantaneous values. Extrusion represents this case,  Figure 17.2(c). As the billet is reduced in cross section to pass through the extrusion  die opening, the metal gradually strain hardens to reach a maximum value. Rather  than determine a sequence of instantaneous stress–strain values during the reduc- tion, which would be not only difﬁ  cult but also of limited interest, it is more useful to  analyze the process based on the average ﬂ  ow stress during deformation.  

Average Flow Stress  The average ﬂ  ow stress (also called the  mean ﬂ  ow stress ) is  the average value of stress over the stress–strain curve from the beginning of strain  to the ﬁ  nal (maximum) value that occurs during deformation. The value is illustrated  in the stress–strain plot of Figure 17.4. The average ﬂ  ow stress is determined by inte- grating the ﬂ  ow curve equation, Equation (17.1), between zero and the ﬁ  nal strain  value deﬁ  ning the range of interest. This yields the equation:

\[
\sigma = K \epsilon^n
\]

where:
- \(\sigma\) is the flow stress,
- \(K\) is the strength coefficient,
- \(\epsilon\) is the true strain, and
- \(n\) is the strain-hardening exponent.

Given:
- \(n = 0.22\),
- \(K = 54,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2\).

### (a) Determine the flow stress at a true strain \(\epsilon = 0.45\).

Substitute the given values into the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = 54,000 \times (0.45)^{0.22}
\]

First, calculate \((0.45)^{0.22}\):

\[
0.45^{0.22} \approx 0.782
\]

Now, calculate \(\sigma\):

\[
\sigma = 54,000 \times 0.782 \approx 42,228 \, \text{lb/in}^2
\]

Thus, the flow stress at a true strain of 0.45 is approximately \(42,228 \, \text{lb/in}^2\).

### (b) Determine the true strain at a flow stress \(\sigma = 40,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2\).

Rearrange the flow curve equation to solve for \(\epsilon\):

\[
40,000 = 54,000 \times \epsilon^{0.22}
\]

Divide both sides by 54,000:

\[
\epsilon^{0.22} = \frac{40,000}{54,000} \approx 0.7407
\]

Now, solve for \(\epsilon\) by raising both sides to the power of \(\frac{1}{0.22}\):

\[
\epsilon = (0.7407)^{\frac{1}{0.22}}
\]

Calculate \((0.7407)^{\frac{1}{0.22}}\):

\[
\epsilon \approx 0.7407^{4.545} \approx 0.367
\]

Thus, the true strain at a flow stress of \(40,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2\) is approximately \(0.367\).

### Final Answers:
(a) The flow stress at a true strain of 0.45 is approximately \(42,228 \, \text{lb/in}^2\).

(b) The true strain at a flow stress of \(40,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2\) is approximately \(0.367\).","The typical stress–strain relationship for a metal exhibits elasticity below the  yield point and strain hardening above it.

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.

Because it is a straight line in this transformation of the data, the relationship  between true stress and true strain in the plastic region can be expressed as  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

This equation is called the  ﬂ  ow curve , and it provides a good approximation of the  behavior of metals in the plastic region, including their capacity for strain hardening.  The constant $K$  is called the  strength coefﬁ  cient , MPa  $(1{\mathrm{b}}/{\mathrm{in}}^{2}),$  and it equals the value  of true stress at a true strain value equal to one. The parameter  $n$  is called the  strain  hardening exponent , and it is the slope of the line in Figure 3.5. Its value is directly  related to a metal’s tendency to work harden. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for selected  metals are given in Table 3.4.

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine the strength coefﬁ  cient and  strain hardening exponent in the ﬂ  ow curve equation: $\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}$ .  

Solution:  We have two points on the ﬂ  ow curve from which the ﬂ  ow curve  parameters can be determined: (1) at the yield point and (2) at the maximum  load.  

(1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ . (1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.

Solving for $n$  and $K$ ,  

(1) $K=160/(0.001998)^{n}$  and (2) $K=375/(0.143)^{n}$   $160/(0.001998)^{n}=375/(0.143)^{n}$  

 $\ln(160)-n\ln(0.001998)=\ln(375)-n\ln(0.143$  ln(0.143)

 $5.0752-(-6.2156)n=5.9269-(-1.9449)n

Then, we will determine the final compressed length of the specimen for both engineering and true strain scenarios.

### Part 1: Tension

#### Engineering Strain

The engineering strain (\(e\)) is defined as:

\[ e = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0} \]

where:
- \(L\) is the final length,
- \(L_0\) is the original length.

Given that the specimen is elongated to twice its original length, we have:

\[ L = 2L_0 \]

Substituting into the formula for engineering strain:

\[ e = \frac{2L_0 - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{L_0}{L_0} = 1 \]

So, the engineering strain is \(1\) or \(100\%\).

#### True Strain

The true strain (\(\epsilon\)) is defined as:

\[ \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{2L_0}{L_0}\right) = \ln(2) \]

Calculating \(\ln(2)\):

\[ \epsilon \approx 0.693 \]

So, the true strain is approximately \(0.693\).

### Part 2: Compression

#### (a) Engineering Strain in Compression

For the engineering strain in compression to be equal to the tension value (which is \(1\)), we set:

\[ e = \frac{L_c - L_0}{L_0} = -1 \]

where \(L_c\) is the final compressed length. Solving for \(L_c\):

\[ -1 = \frac{L_c - L_0}{L_0} \]

\[ -1 = \frac{L_c}{L_0} - 1 \]

\[ 0 = \frac{L_c}{L_0} \]

\[ L_c = 0 \]

This result is impossible because it implies the specimen is compressed to zero length, which is physically unrealistic.

#### (b) True Strain in Compression

For the true strain in compression to be equal to the tension value (\(\epsilon = 0.693\)), we set:

\[ \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L_c}{L_0}\right) = -0.693 \]

Solving for \(L_c\):

\[ -0.693 = \ln\left(\frac{L_c}{L_0}\right) \]

Exponentiating both sides:

\[ e^{-0.693} = \frac{L_c}{L_0} \]

\[ \frac{L_c}{L_0} \approx 0.5 \]

\[ L_c \approx 0.5L_0 \]

So, the final compressed length \(L_c\) is approximately half of the original length.

### Conclusion

- **Engineering Strain in Tension:** \(1\) or \(100\%\)
- **True Strain in Tension:** \(0.693\)
- **Engineering Strain in Compression:** Impossible result (\(L_c = 0\))
- **True Strain in Compression:** \(L_c \approx 0.5L_0\)

This demonstrates that true strain is a more realistic measure during plastic deformation, as it provides a feasible result for compression.","![](images/d9e12c60253897fff622ef840f4c9f7918425434d2680004cdc9b82d613eb271.jpg)  
FIGURE 3.2  Typical  progress of a tensile  test: (1) beginning of  test, no load; (2) uniform  elongation and reduc- tion of cross-sectional  area; (3) continued  elongation, maximum  load reached; (4) neck- ing begins, load begins  to decrease; and (5)  fracture. If pieces are  put back together as in  (6), ﬁ  nal length can be  measured.  

The load and the change in length of the specimen are recorded as testing proceeds,  to provide the data required to determine the stress–strain relationship. There are  two different types of stress–strain curves: (1) engineering stress–strain and (2) true  stress–strain. The ﬁ  rst is more important in design, and the second is more important  in manufacturing.  

Engineering Stress–strain   The engineering stress and strain in a tensile test are  deﬁ  ned relative to the original area and length of the test specimen. These values are  of interest in design because the designer expects that the strains experienced by any  component of the product will not signiﬁ  cantly change its shape. The components  are designed to withstand the anticipated stresses encountered in service.  

A typical engineering stress–strain curve from a tensile test of a metallic speci- men is illustrated in Figure 3.3. The  engineering stress  at any point on the curve is  deﬁ  ned as the force divided by the original area:  

$$
s=\frac{F}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $s=$  engineering stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ );  $F=$  applied force in the test, $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A_{o}=$  original area of the test specimen,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}$   $(\mathrm{in}^{2}]$ ). The  engineering strain  at any  point in the test is given by  

$$
e=\frac{L-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $e\:=\:$  engineering strain,  $\mathrm{mm/mm~(in/in)}$ ;  $L=$ length at any point during the  elongation, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and $L_{o}=$  original gage length, mm (in). The units of engineer- ing strain are given as $\mathrm{mm/mm}$  (in/in), but think of it as representing elongation per  unit length, without units.  

The stress–strain relationship in Figure 3.3 has two regions, indicating two dis- tinct forms of behavior: (1) elastic and (2) plastic. In the elastic region, the relation- ship between stress and strain is linear, and the material exhibits elastic behavior by  

![](images/d0bec5dc14bfbf80832d78675a36196cfd2800b33ec74d7a6c30553b276140c2.jpg)  

returning to its original length when the load (stress) is released. The relationship is  deﬁ  ned by  Hooke’s law :  

$$
s=E e
$$  

where  $E=$   modulus of elasticity  (also known as  Young’s modulus ), MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ,  a measure of the inherent stiffness of a material. It is a constant of proportionality  whose value is different for different materials. Table 3.1 presents typical values for  several materials, metals and nonmetals.  

As stress increases, some point in the linear relationship is ﬁ  nally reached at  which the material begins to yield. This  yield point   $Y$ of the material can be identi- ﬁ  ed in the ﬁ  gure by the change in slope at the end of the linear region. Because the  start of yielding is usually difﬁ  cult to see in a plot of test data (it does not usually oc- cur as an abrupt change in slope), $Y$  is typically deﬁ  ned as the stress at which a strain  offset of  $0.2\%$  from the straight line has occurred. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the

previous curve, a downturn ﬁ  nally occurs as a result of necking. A dashed line is used  in the ﬁ  gure to indicate the projected continuation of the true stress–strain plot if  necking had not occurred.  

As strain becomes signiﬁ  cant in the plastic region, the values of true strain and  engineering strain diverge. True strain can be related to the corresponding engineer- ing strain by  

$$
\epsilon=\ln(1+e)
$$  

Similarly, true stress and engineering stress can be related by the expression  

$$
\sigma=s\,(1\,+\,e)
$$  

In Figure 3.4, note that stress increases continuously in the plastic region until  necking begins. When this happened in the engineering stress–strain curve, its sig- niﬁ  cance was lost because an admittedly erroneous area value was used to calculate  stress. Now when the true stress also increases, it cannot be dismissed so lightly.  What it means is that the metal is becoming stronger as strain increases. This is the  property called  strain hardening  that was mentioned in the previous chapter in the  discussion of metallic crystal structures, and it is a property that most metals exhibit  to a greater or lesser degree.  

# Example 3.2  True stress and  strain  

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine (a) true stress and (b) true strain  at the maximum load of  $65{,}000\:\mathrm{N}.$ .  

Solution:  (a) True stress is deﬁ  ned as the load divided by the instantaneous  area. To ﬁ  nd the instantaneous area, we assume uniform elongation prior to  necking. Thus, $A L=A_{o}L_{o}$ , and $A=A_{o}L_{o}/L=200(50)/57.7=173.3\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}/$  

$$
{\sigma=F/A=65,\!000/173.3=375\;\mathrm{MPa}}
$$  

(b) By Equation (3.7), true strain $\epsilon=\ln(L/L_{o})=\ln(57.7/50)=$ $\ln(1.154)={\bf0.143}$ .  

Check:  Use Equations (3.8) and (3.9) to check these values:  

Using Equation (3.8) and the value of  $e$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\epsilon=\ln(1+0.154)=0.143$ .  

Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.  

! During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}.

$ (b) Subtracting the $0.2\%$  offset, engineering strain  $e=(50.2-50.0)/50.0\;-

$ $0.002=0.002$ Rearranging Equation (3.3), modulus of elasticity  $E=s/e=160/0.002=$  

 $\mathbf{80,000\,M P a}$ .

 (c) Tensile strength $=$  maximum load divided by original area: 

 ${\cal T}S=65{,}000/200=325~\mathrm{M}\mathrm{Pa}$ .

 (d) By Equation (3.2), engineering strain at maximum load  $e=$  

 $(57.7-50)/50={\bf0.154}$ .

 (e) Deﬁ  ned in Equation (3.4), percent elongation $E L=(59.5-50)/50=$  

 $\mathbf{0.19}=\mathbf{19\%}$ .  

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation.

"Derive an expression for true strain as a function of D and Do for a tensile test specimen of round cross section, where D = the instantaneous diameter of the specimen and Do is its original diameter.","Solution: Starting with the definition of true strain as H = ln(L/Lo) and assuming constant volume, we have V = AoLo = AL Therefore, L/Lo = Ao/A       A =pi D^2 and Ao =pi Do^2 and A0=piD^2        Ao/A = piDo^2/piD^2 = (Do/D)2 H = ln(Do/D)2 = 2ln(Do/D)","To derive an expression for true strain as a function of the instantaneous diameter \( D \) and the original diameter \( D_o \) for a tensile test specimen of round cross-section, we need to consider the relationship between the change in cross-sectional area and the change in length during deformation.

### Step-by-Step Derivation:

1. **Understand True Strain:**
   True strain (\(\epsilon_t\)) is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the instantaneous length (\(L\)) to the original length (\(L_o\)):

   \[
   \epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_o}\right)
   \]

2. **Volume Constancy Assumption:**
   For a tensile test specimen, we often assume that the volume remains constant during deformation (especially in the plastic region). Therefore, the initial volume (\(V_o\)) is equal to the instantaneous volume (\(V\)):

   \[
   V_o = A_o \cdot L_o = A \cdot L
   \]

   where \(A_o\) and \(A\) are the original and instantaneous cross-sectional areas, respectively.

3. **Relate Area to Diameter:**
   For a round cross-section, the area is related to the diameter by:

   \[
   A_o = \frac{\pi}{4} D_o^2 \quad \text{and} \quad A = \frac{\pi}{4} D^2
   \]

4. **Substitute Areas into Volume Constancy:**
   Substitute the expressions for \(A_o\) and \(A\) into the volume constancy equation:

   \[
   \frac{\pi}{4} D_o^2 \cdot L_o = \frac{\pi}{4} D^2 \cdot L
   \]

   Simplifying, we get:

   \[
   D_o^2 \cdot L_o = D^2 \cdot L
   \]

5. **Solve for Length Ratio:**
   Rearrange the equation to solve for the ratio of lengths:

   \[
   \frac{L}{L_o} = \frac{D_o^2}{D^2}
   \]

6. **Substitute into True Strain Expression:**
   Substitute the length ratio into the true strain formula:

   \[
   \epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_o}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{D_o^2}{D^2}\right)
   \]

7. **Simplify the Expression:**
   Use the logarithmic identity \(\ln(a^b) = b \ln(a)\) to simplify:

   \[
   \epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{D_o^2}{D^2}\right) = 2 \ln\left(\frac{D_o}{D}\right)
   \]

### Final Expression:

The true strain (\(\epsilon_t\)) as a function of the instantaneous diameter \(D\) and the original diameter \(D_o\) for a tensile test specimen of round cross-section is:

\[
\epsilon_t = 2 \ln\left(\frac{D_o}{D}\right)
\]

This expression shows that the true strain is proportional to the natural logarithm of the ratio of the original diameter to the instantaneous diameter, multiplied by 2.","To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

metallic test specimens and the associated nonuniform effect on elongation and area  reduction. Despite these difﬁ  culties, percent elongation and percent area reduction  are the most commonly used measures of ductility in engineering practice.

# Example 3.1  Engineering  stress and strain  

A tensile test specimen has a starting gage length $=50\:\mathrm{mm}$  and a cross-sectional  area $=200\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ . During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}. ![](images/d9e12c60253897fff622ef840f4c9f7918425434d2680004cdc9b82d613eb271.jpg)  
FIGURE 3.2  Typical  progress of a tensile  test: (1) beginning of  test, no load; (2) uniform  elongation and reduc- tion of cross-sectional  area; (3) continued  elongation, maximum  load reached; (4) neck- ing begins, load begins  to decrease; and (5)  fracture. If pieces are  put back together as in  (6), ﬁ  nal length can be  measured.  

The load and the change in length of the specimen are recorded as testing proceeds,  to provide the data required to determine the stress–strain relationship. There are  two different types of stress–strain curves: (1) engineering stress–strain and (2) true  stress–strain. The ﬁ  rst is more important in design, and the second is more important  in manufacturing.  

Engineering Stress–strain   The engineering stress and strain in a tensile test are  deﬁ  ned relative to the original area and length of the test specimen. These values are  of interest in design because the designer expects that the strains experienced by any  component of the product will not signiﬁ  cantly change its shape. The components  are designed to withstand the anticipated stresses encountered in service.  

A typical engineering stress–strain curve from a tensile test of a metallic speci- men is illustrated in Figure 3.3. The  engineering stress  at any point on the curve is  deﬁ  ned as the force divided by the original area:  

$$
s=\frac{F}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $s=$  engineering stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ );  $F=$  applied force in the test, $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A_{o}=$  original area of the test specimen,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}$   $(\mathrm{in}^{2}]$ ). The  engineering strain  at any  point in the test is given by  

$$
e=\frac{L-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $e\:=\:$  engineering strain,  $\mathrm{mm/mm~(in/in)}$ ;  $L=$ length at any point during the  elongation, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and $L_{o}=$  original gage length, mm (in). The units of engineer- ing strain are given as $\mathrm{mm/mm}$  (in/in), but think of it as representing elongation per  unit length, without units.  

The stress–strain relationship in Figure 3.3 has two regions, indicating two dis- tinct forms of behavior: (1) elastic and (2) plastic. In the elastic region, the relation- ship between stress and strain is linear, and the material exhibits elastic behavior by  

![](images/d0bec5dc14bfbf80832d78675a36196cfd2800b33ec74d7a6c30553b276140c2.jpg)  

returning to its original length when the load (stress) is released. The relationship is  deﬁ  ned by  Hooke’s law :  

$$
s=E e
$$  

where  $E=$   modulus of elasticity  (also known as  Young’s modulus ), MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ,  a measure of the inherent stiffness of a material. It is a constant of proportionality  whose value is different for different materials. Table 3.1 presents typical values for  several materials, metals and nonmetals.  

As stress increases, some point in the linear relationship is ﬁ  nally reached at  which the material begins to yield. This  yield point   $Y$ of the material can be identi- ﬁ  ed in the ﬁ  gure by the change in slope at the end of the linear region. Because the  start of yielding is usually difﬁ  cult to see in a plot of test data (it does not usually oc- cur as an abrupt change in slope), $Y$  is typically deﬁ  ned as the stress at which a strain  offset of  $0.2\%$  from the straight line has occurred. (1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ .  

Solving for $n$  and $K$ ,  

(1) $K=160/(0.001998)^{n}$  and (2) $K=375/(0.143)^{n}$   $160/(0.001998)^{n}=375/(0.143)^{n}$  

 $\ln(160)-n\ln(0.001998)=\ln(375)-n\ln(0.143$  ln(0.143)

 $5.0752-(-6.2156)n=5.9269-(-1.9449)n

$ $5.0752+6.2156n=5.9269+1.9449n

$ $(6.2156-1.9449)n=5.9269-5.0752

$ $4.2707n=0.8517$        $n=0.1994$ Substituting back into (1): $K=160/(0.001998)^{0.1994}=552.7$ .  

Check:  Using (2):  $K=375/(0.143)^{0.1994}=552.7.$  

The ﬂ  ow curve equation is $\sigma={\tt552.7}\epsilon^{\tt0.1994}$ .  

Necking in a tensile test and in metal forming operations that stretch the work  part is closely related to strain hardening. As the test specimen is elongated during  the initial part of the test (before necking begins), uniform straining occurs through- out the length because if any element in the specimen becomes strained more than  the surrounding metal, its strength increases by work hardening, thus making it  more resistant to additional strain until the surrounding metal has been strained  an equal amount. Finally, the strain becomes so large that uniform straining cannot  be sustained. A weak point in the length develops (from buildup of dislocations at  grain boundaries, impurities in the metal, or other factors), and necking is initiated,  leading to failure. Empirical evidence reveals that necking begins for a particular  metal when the true strain reaches a value equal to the strain-hardening exponent $n$ .  Therefore, a higher $n$  value means that the metal can be strained further before the  onset of necking during tensile loading.  

Types of Stress–Strain Relationships  Much information about elastic–plastic  behavior is provided by the true stress–strain curve. As indicated, Hooke’s law  ( $\mathit{(\sigma=E\epsilon)}$ ) governs the metal’s behavior in the elastic region, and the ﬂ  ow curve

"Show that true strain H = ln(1 + e), where e = engineering strain.","Solution: Starting definitions: (1) H = ln(L/Lo) and (2) e = (L -Lo)/Lo Consider definition (2): e = L/Lo -Lo/Lo = L/Lo -1 Rearranging, 1 + e = L/Lo Substituting this into definition (1), H = ln(1 + e)","To show that the true strain \( \epsilon \) is equal to \( \ln(1 + e) \), where \( e \) is the engineering strain, we need to understand the definitions of both true strain and engineering strain.

### Definitions:
1. **Engineering Strain (\( e \))**: This is defined as the change in length divided by the original length. Mathematically, it is expressed as:
   \[
   e = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0}
   \]
   where \( L \) is the final length and \( L_0 \) is the original length.

2. **True Strain (\( \epsilon \))**: This is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the final length to the original length. It is expressed as:
   \[
   \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right)
   \]

### Derivation:
To derive the relationship between true strain and engineering strain, we start with the definition of engineering strain:
\[
e = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0}
\]

Rearranging this equation to express \( L \) in terms of \( L_0 \) and \( e \), we get:
\[
L = L_0(1 + e)
\]

Now, substitute this expression for \( L \) into the formula for true strain:
\[
\epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{L_0(1 + e)}{L_0}\right)
\]

The \( L_0 \) terms cancel out, simplifying the expression to:
\[
\epsilon = \ln(1 + e)
\]

Thus, we have shown that the true strain \( \epsilon \) is indeed equal to \( \ln(1 + e) \), where \( e \) is the engineering strain.

### Conclusion:
The relationship between true strain and engineering strain is given by:
\[
\epsilon = \ln(1 + e)
\]

This derivation confirms the formula provided in the context of the problem, demonstrating the mathematical relationship between true strain and engineering strain.","In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the

previous curve, a downturn ﬁ  nally occurs as a result of necking. A dashed line is used  in the ﬁ  gure to indicate the projected continuation of the true stress–strain plot if  necking had not occurred.  

As strain becomes signiﬁ  cant in the plastic region, the values of true strain and  engineering strain diverge. True strain can be related to the corresponding engineer- ing strain by  

$$
\epsilon=\ln(1+e)
$$  

Similarly, true stress and engineering stress can be related by the expression  

$$
\sigma=s\,(1\,+\,e)
$$  

In Figure 3.4, note that stress increases continuously in the plastic region until  necking begins. When this happened in the engineering stress–strain curve, its sig- niﬁ  cance was lost because an admittedly erroneous area value was used to calculate  stress. Now when the true stress also increases, it cannot be dismissed so lightly.  What it means is that the metal is becoming stronger as strain increases. This is the  property called  strain hardening  that was mentioned in the previous chapter in the  discussion of metallic crystal structures, and it is a property that most metals exhibit  to a greater or lesser degree.

Solution:  (a) True stress is deﬁ  ned as the load divided by the instantaneous  area. To ﬁ  nd the instantaneous area, we assume uniform elongation prior to  necking. Thus, $A L=A_{o}L_{o}$ , and $A=A_{o}L_{o}/L=200(50)/57.7=173.3\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}/$  

$$
{\sigma=F/A=65,\!000/173.3=375\;\mathrm{MPa}}
$$  

(b) By Equation (3.7), true strain $\epsilon=\ln(L/L_{o})=\ln(57.7/50)=$ $\ln(1.154)={\bf0.143}$ .  

Check:  Use Equations (3.8) and (3.9) to check these values:  

Using Equation (3.8) and the value of  $e$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\epsilon=\ln(1+0.154)=0.143$ .  

Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.  

! (1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ .  

Solving for $n$  and $K$ ,  

(1) $K=160/(0.001998)^{n}$  and (2) $K=375/(0.143)^{n}$   $160/(0.001998)^{n}=375/(0.143)^{n}$  

 $\ln(160)-n\ln(0.001998)=\ln(375)-n\ln(0.143$  ln(0.143)

 $5.0752-(-6.2156)n=5.9269-(-1.9449)n

$ $5.0752+6.2156n=5.9269+1.9449n

$ $(6.2156-1.9449)n=5.9269-5.0752

$ $4.2707n=0.8517$        $n=0.1994$ Substituting back into (1): $K=160/(0.001998)^{0.1994}=552.7$ .  

Check:  Using (2):  $K=375/(0.143)^{0.1994}=552.7.$  

The ﬂ  ow curve equation is $\sigma={\tt552.7}\epsilon^{\tt0.1994}$ .  

Necking in a tensile test and in metal forming operations that stretch the work  part is closely related to strain hardening. As the test specimen is elongated during  the initial part of the test (before necking begins), uniform straining occurs through- out the length because if any element in the specimen becomes strained more than  the surrounding metal, its strength increases by work hardening, thus making it  more resistant to additional strain until the surrounding metal has been strained  an equal amount. Finally, the strain becomes so large that uniform straining cannot  be sustained. A weak point in the length develops (from buildup of dislocations at  grain boundaries, impurities in the metal, or other factors), and necking is initiated,  leading to failure. Empirical evidence reveals that necking begins for a particular  metal when the true strain reaches a value equal to the strain-hardening exponent $n$ .  Therefore, a higher $n$  value means that the metal can be strained further before the  onset of necking during tensile loading.  

Types of Stress–Strain Relationships  Much information about elastic–plastic  behavior is provided by the true stress–strain curve. As indicated, Hooke’s law  ( $\mathit{(\sigma=E\epsilon)}$ ) governs the metal’s behavior in the elastic region, and the ﬂ  ow curve

Because it is a straight line in this transformation of the data, the relationship  between true stress and true strain in the plastic region can be expressed as  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

This equation is called the  ﬂ  ow curve , and it provides a good approximation of the  behavior of metals in the plastic region, including their capacity for strain hardening.  The constant $K$  is called the  strength coefﬁ  cient , MPa  $(1{\mathrm{b}}/{\mathrm{in}}^{2}),$  and it equals the value  of true stress at a true strain value equal to one. The parameter  $n$  is called the  strain  hardening exponent , and it is the slope of the line in Figure 3.5. Its value is directly  related to a metal’s tendency to work harden.

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine the strength coefﬁ  cient and  strain hardening exponent in the ﬂ  ow curve equation: $\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}$ .

A copper wire of diameter 0.80 mm fails at an engineering stress = 248.2 MPa. Its ductility is measured as 75% reduction of area.

However, it should be noted that these values are associated with the necked portion of the test specimen.","To solve this problem, we need to determine the true stress and true strain at failure for a copper wire given its engineering stress at failure and its ductility in terms of area reduction.

### Given:
- Diameter of the wire, \( d = 0.80 \, \text{mm} \)
- Engineering stress at failure, \( \sigma_{\text{eng}} = 248.2 \, \text{MPa} \)
- Ductility as reduction of area, \( AR = 75\% \)

### Steps to Solve:

#### 1. Calculate the Original Cross-Sectional Area:
The original cross-sectional area \( A_o \) of the wire can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle:
\[
A_o = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}
\]
Substituting the given diameter:
\[
A_o = \frac{\pi (0.80)^2}{4} = \frac{\pi \times 0.64}{4} = 0.5024 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

#### 2. Calculate the Final Cross-Sectional Area:
The reduction of area is given as 75%, which means the final area \( A_f \) is 25% of the original area:
\[
A_f = A_o \times (1 - 0.75) = A_o \times 0.25 = 0.5024 \times 0.25 = 0.1256 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

#### 3. Calculate the True Stress:
True stress \( \sigma_{\text{true}} \) is calculated using the actual (instantaneous) area at failure:
\[
\sigma_{\text{true}} = \frac{F}{A_f}
\]
We know the engineering stress is given by:
\[
\sigma_{\text{eng}} = \frac{F}{A_o}
\]
Thus, the force \( F \) can be expressed as:
\[
F = \sigma_{\text{eng}} \times A_o = 248.2 \times 0.5024 = 124.64 \, \text{N}
\]
Now, substituting back to find true stress:
\[
\sigma_{\text{true}} = \frac{124.64}{0.1256} = 992.7 \, \text{MPa}
\]

#### 4. Calculate the True Strain:
True strain \( \epsilon_{\text{true}} \) is calculated using the formula:
\[
\epsilon_{\text{true}} = \ln \left( \frac{A_o}{A_f} \right)
\]
Substituting the areas:
\[
\epsilon_{\text{true}} = \ln \left( \frac{0.5024}{0.1256} \right) = \ln(4) = 1.386
\]

### Final Answer:
- **True Stress at Failure:** \( \sigma_{\text{true}} = 992.7 \, \text{MPa} \)
- **True Strain at Failure:** \( \epsilon_{\text{true}} = 1.386 \)","During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}.

$ (b) Subtracting the $0.2\%$  offset, engineering strain  $e=(50.2-50.0)/50.0\;-

 (c) Tensile strength $=$  maximum load divided by original area:

 (d) By Equation (3.2), engineering strain at maximum load  $e=$

 (e) Deﬁ  ned in Equation (3.4), percent elongation $E L=(59.5-50)/50=$  

 $\mathbf{0.19}=\mathbf{19\%}$ .  

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the  

! To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

metallic test specimens and the associated nonuniform effect on elongation and area  reduction. Despite these difﬁ  culties, percent elongation and percent area reduction  are the most commonly used measures of ductility in engineering practice.

# Example 3.1  Engineering  stress and strain  

A tensile test specimen has a starting gage length $=50\:\mathrm{mm}$  and a cross-sectional  area $=200\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ . During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}. (1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ .  

Solving for $n$  and $K$ ,  

(1) $K=160/(0.001998)^{n}$  and (2) $K=375/(0.143)^{n}$   $160/(0.001998)^{n}=375/(0.143)^{n}$  

 $\ln(160)-n\ln(0.001998)=\ln(375)-n\ln(0.143$  ln(0.143)

 $5.0752-(-6.2156)n=5.9269-(-1.9449)n

$ $5.0752+6.2156n=5.9269+1.9449n

$ $(6.2156-1.9449)n=5.9269-5.0752

$ $4.2707n=0.8517$        $n=0.1994$ Substituting back into (1): $K=160/(0.001998)^{0.1994}=552.7$ .  

Check:  Using (2):  $K=375/(0.143)^{0.1994}=552.7.$  

The ﬂ  ow curve equation is $\sigma={\tt552.7}\epsilon^{\tt0.1994}$ .

### Given Data:
- Original gage length, \( L_o = 2.0 \, \text{in} \)
- Cross-sectional area, \( A_o = 0.5 \, \text{in}^2 \)
- Maximum load, \( F = 37,000 \, \text{lb} \)
- Elongation at maximum load = 24%

### Calculations:

#### 1. **Calculate the Engineering Stress:**

The engineering stress (\( s \)) is calculated using the formula:
\[
s = \frac{F}{A_o}
\]

Substitute the given values:
\[
s = \frac{37,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} = 74,000 \, \text{psi}
\]

#### 2. **Calculate the Engineering Strain:**

The engineering strain (\( e \)) is given by the elongation divided by the original length:
\[
e = \frac{L - L_o}{L_o}
\]

Given that the elongation is 24%, the final length \( L \) is:
\[
L = L_o + 0.24 \times L_o = 1.24 \times L_o
\]

Thus, the engineering strain is:
\[
e = \frac{1.24 \times L_o - L_o}{L_o} = 0.24
\]

#### 3. **Calculate the True Stress:**

The true stress (\( \sigma \)) is calculated using the formula:
\[
\sigma = \frac{F}{A}
\]

However, since the cross-sectional area decreases as the specimen elongates, we need to adjust the area. The true stress can be approximated using the engineering stress and strain:
\[
\sigma = s \times (1 + e)
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\sigma = 74,000 \, \text{psi} \times (1 + 0.24) = 74,000 \, \text{psi} \times 1.24 = 91,760 \, \text{psi}
\]

#### 4. **Calculate the True Strain:**

The true strain (\( \epsilon \)) is calculated using the formula:
\[
\epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_o}\right)
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\epsilon = \ln(1.24) \approx 0.215
\]

- **True Stress:** \( 91,760 \, \text{psi} \)

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the  

! To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

# Example 3.1  Engineering  stress and strain  

A tensile test specimen has a starting gage length $=50\:\mathrm{mm}$  and a cross-sectional  area $=200\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ . During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ .

If pieces are  put back together as in  (6), ﬁ  nal length can be  measured.  

The load and the change in length of the specimen are recorded as testing proceeds,  to provide the data required to determine the stress–strain relationship. There are  two different types of stress–strain curves: (1) engineering stress–strain and (2) true  stress–strain. The ﬁ  rst is more important in design, and the second is more important  in manufacturing.  

Engineering Stress–strain   The engineering stress and strain in a tensile test are  deﬁ  ned relative to the original area and length of the test specimen. These values are  of interest in design because the designer expects that the strains experienced by any  component of the product will not signiﬁ  cantly change its shape. The components  are designed to withstand the anticipated stresses encountered in service.  

A typical engineering stress–strain curve from a tensile test of a metallic speci- men is illustrated in Figure 3.3. The  engineering stress  at any point on the curve is  deﬁ  ned as the force divided by the original area:  

$$
s=\frac{F}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $s=$  engineering stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ );  $F=$  applied force in the test, $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A_{o}=$  original area of the test specimen,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}$   $(\mathrm{in}^{2}]$ ). The  engineering strain  at any  point in the test is given by  

$$
e=\frac{L-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $e\:=\:$  engineering strain,  $\mathrm{mm/mm~(in/in)}$ ;  $L=$ length at any point during the  elongation, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and $L_{o}=$  original gage length, mm (in). The units of engineer- ing strain are given as $\mathrm{mm/mm}$  (in/in), but think of it as representing elongation per  unit length, without units.  

The stress–strain relationship in Figure 3.3 has two regions, indicating two dis- tinct forms of behavior: (1) elastic and (2) plastic. In the elastic region, the relation- ship between stress and strain is linear, and the material exhibits elastic behavior by  

![](images/d0bec5dc14bfbf80832d78675a36196cfd2800b33ec74d7a6c30553b276140c2.jpg)  

returning to its original length when the load (stress) is released. The relationship is  deﬁ  ned by  Hooke’s law :  

$$
s=E e
$$  

where  $E=$   modulus of elasticity  (also known as  Young’s modulus ), MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ,  a measure of the inherent stiffness of a material. It is a constant of proportionality  whose value is different for different materials. Table 3.1 presents typical values for  several materials, metals and nonmetals.  

As stress increases, some point in the linear relationship is ﬁ  nally reached at  which the material begins to yield. This  yield point   $Y$ of the material can be identi- ﬁ  ed in the ﬁ  gure by the change in slope at the end of the linear region. Because the  start of yielding is usually difﬁ  cult to see in a plot of test data (it does not usually oc- cur as an abrupt change in slope), $Y$  is typically deﬁ  ned as the stress at which a strain  offset of  $0.2\%$  from the straight line has occurred.",/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt,"[ 0 . 9 0 8 4 7 3 5 6 8 3 7 4 8 2 7 8 ,   0 . 8 9 9 1 2 7 1 1 9 0 6 1 6 0 0 3 ,   0 . 8 9 3 7 2 1 6 9 6 7 2 8 6 6 9 9 ]",3.0,3.17
"A metal alloy has been tested in a tensile test with the following results for the flow curve parameters: strength coefficient = 620.5 MPa and strain-hardening exponent = 0.26. The same metal is now tested in a compression test in which the starting height of the specimen = 62.5 mm and its diameter = 25 mm. Assuming that the cross section increases uniformly, determine the load required to compress the specimen to a height of (a) 50 mm ","Solution: Starting volume of test specimen V = pi*hDo^ 2/4 = 62.5pi(25)^2/4 = 30679.6 mm3. (a) At h = 50 mm, H = ln(62.5/50) = ln(1.25) = 0.223 Yf = 620.5(.223)^.26 = 420.1 MPa A = V/L = 30679.6/50 = 613.6 mm2 F = 420.1(613.6) = 257,770 N  ","To solve this problem, we need to determine the load required to compress a cylindrical specimen from an initial height of 62.5 mm to a final height of 50 mm. We will use the flow curve parameters provided: the strength coefficient \( K = 620.5 \, \text{MPa} \) and the strain-hardening exponent \( n = 0.26 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Initial Volume:**
   The volume of the cylinder remains constant during compression. The initial volume \( V_0 \) is given by:
   \[
   V_0 = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 h_0
   \]
   where \( d = 25 \, \text{mm} \) and \( h_0 = 62.5 \, \text{mm} \).

   \[
   V_0 = \pi \left(\frac{25}{2}\right)^2 \times 62.5 = \pi \times 12.5^2 \times 62.5
   \]

2. **Calculate the Final Volume:**
   Since volume is conserved, the final volume \( V_f \) is equal to the initial volume \( V_0 \).

3. **Calculate the Final Diameter:**
   The final height \( h_f = 50 \, \text{mm} \). Using volume conservation:
   \[
   V_f = \pi \left(\frac{d_f}{2}\right)^2 h_f = V_0
   \]
   Solving for \( d_f \):
   \[
   \pi \left(\frac{d_f}{2}\right)^2 \times 50 = \pi \times 12.5^2 \times 62.5
   \]
   \[
   \left(\frac{d_f}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{12.5^2 \times 62.5}{50}
   \]
   \[
   d_f = 2 \times \sqrt{\frac{12.5^2 \times 62.5}{50}}
   \]

4. **Calculate the True Strain:**
   True strain \( \epsilon \) in compression is given by:
   \[
   \epsilon = \ln \left(\frac{h_0}{h_f}\right) = \ln \left(\frac{62.5}{50}\right)
   \]

5. **Calculate the Flow Stress:**
   The flow stress \( \sigma \) is given by the flow curve equation:
   \[
   \sigma = K \epsilon^n = 620.5 \times \left(\ln \left(\frac{62.5}{50}\right)\right)^{0.26}
   \]

6. **Calculate the Load:**
   The load \( F \) required is the flow stress times the final cross-sectional area \( A_f \):
   \[
   A_f = \pi \left(\frac{d_f}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   \[
   F = \sigma \times A_f
   \]

By calculating each of these steps, we can determine the load required to compress the specimen to a height of 50 mm. Let's compute these values:

- **Initial Volume:**
  \[
  V_0 = \pi \times 12.5^2 \times 62.5 = 30,664.5 \, \text{mm}^3
  \]

- **Final Diameter:**
  \[
  d_f = 2 \times \sqrt{\frac{12.5^2 \times 62.5}{50}} = 28.87 \, \text{mm}
  \]

- **True Strain:**
  \[
  \epsilon = \ln \left(\frac{62.5}{50}\right) = 0.2231
  \]

- **Flow Stress:**
  \[
  \sigma = 620.5 \times (0.2231)^{0.26} = 620.5 \times 0.634 = 393.1 \, \text{MPa}
  \]

- **Final Area:**
  \[
  A_f = \pi \left(\frac{28.87}{2}\right)^2 = 654.5 \, \text{mm}^2
  \]

- **Load:**
  \[
  F = 393.1 \times 654.5 = 257,340.95 \, \text{N}
  \]

Thus, the load required to compress the specimen to a height of 50 mm is approximately \( 257,341 \, \text{N} \).","During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.

 (e) Deﬁ  ned in Equation (3.4), percent elongation $E L=(59.5-50)/50=$

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the  

! The work metal has a strength  coefﬁ  cient $=415\,\mathrm{MPa}$ , and strain hardening exponent $=0.18$ . Use the Johnson  formula with $a=0.8$  and $b=1.5$  to estimate extrusion strain. Determine the  pressure applied to the end of the billet as the ram moves forward.  

Solution:  The ram pressure will be calculated at billet lengths of $L=75\,\mathrm{mm}$   (starting value), $L=50\,\mathrm{mm},L=25\,\mathrm{mm}$ , and $L=0$ . The ideal true strain,  extrusion strain using Johnson’s formula, and average ﬂ  ow stress are computed  as follows:  

$$
\epsilon=\ln r_{x}=\ln4.0=1.3863
$$  

![](images/48949a4efccbdf6f0258f662bfec4ba7b49ecd613f0c64611c73dc9fa99d95c4.jpg)  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\epsilon_{x}=0.8+1.5(1.3863)=2.8795}}\\ {{\displaystyle{\overline{{Y}}_{f}=\frac{415(1.3863)^{0.18}}{1.18}=373\;\mathrm{MPa}}}}\end{array}
$$  

$L=75\,\mathrm{mm}$ : With a die angle of  $90^{\mathrm{o}}$ , the billet metal is assumed to be forced  through the die opening almost immediately; thus, the calculation assumes  that maximum pressure is reached at the billet length of  $75\:\mathrm{mm}$ . For die angles  less than $90^{\circ}$ , the pressure would build to a maximum as in Figure 18.34 as the  starting billet is squeezed into the cone-shaped portion of the extrusion die.  Using Equation (18.23b),  

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}&{}&{p=373\left(2.8795+2\frac{75}{25}\right)=3312\;\mathrm{MPa}}\\ &{}&\\ &{}&{L=50\;\mathrm{mm};p=373\left(2.8795+2\frac{50}{25}\right)=2566\;\mathrm{MPa}}\\ &{}&\\ &{}&{L=25\;\mathrm{mm};p=373\left(2.8795+2\frac{25}{25}\right)=1820\;\mathrm{MPa}}\end{array}
$$  

$L=0$ : Zero length is a hypothetical value in direct extrusion. In reality, it is  impossible to squeeze all of the metal through the die opening. Instead, a por- tion of the billet (the “butt”) remains unextruded and the pressure begins to  increase rapidly as $L$  approaches zero. This increase in pressure at the end of  the stroke is seen in the plot of ram pressure versus ram stroke in Figure 18.34.  Calculated below is the hypothetical minimum value of ram pressure that  would result at  $L=0$ .  

$$
p=373\left(2.8795+2{\frac{0}{25}}\right)={\bf1074}\;{\bf M P a}
$$  

This is also the value of ram pressure that would be associated with indirect  extrusion throughout the length of the billet.  

# 18.5.3  EXTRUSION DIES AND PRESSES  

Important factors in an extrusion die are die angle and oriﬁ  ce shape. Die angle, more  precisely die half-angle, is shown as $\alpha$  in Figure 18.35(a). For low angles, surface area of  the die is large, leading to increased friction at the die-billet interface. Higher friction  results in larger ram force. On the other hand, a large die angle causes more turbulence  in the metal ﬂ  ow during reduction, increasing the ram force required. Thus, the effect  of die angle on ram force is a U-shaped function, as in Figure 18.35(b). An optimum  die angle exists, as suggested by the hypothetical plot. The optimum angle depends on  various factors (e.g., work material, billet temperature, and lubrication) and is therefore  difﬁ  cult to determine for a given extrusion job. To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

We will use the flow curve parameters provided (strength coefficient and strain-hardening exponent) to calculate the true stress and then determine the load.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the True Strain:**

   The true strain (\(\epsilon\)) in compression is given by the formula:
   \[
   \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{h_0}{h_f}\right)
   \]
   where \(h_0\) is the initial height and \(h_f\) is the final height.

   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{62.5}{37.5}\right) = \ln(1.6667) \approx 0.5108
   \]

2. **Calculate the True Stress:**

   The true stress (\(\sigma\)) can be calculated using the flow curve equation:
   \[
   \sigma = K \cdot \epsilon^n
   \]
   where \(K\) is the strength coefficient and \(n\) is the strain-hardening exponent.

   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \sigma = 620.5 \cdot (0.5108)^{0.26}
   \]

   Calculating the exponent:
   \[
   (0.5108)^{0.26} \approx 0.804
   \]

   Therefore, the true stress is:
   \[
   \sigma = 620.5 \cdot 0.804 \approx 499.2 \, \text{MPa}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Final Cross-Sectional Area:**

   Assuming volume constancy during deformation, the initial volume equals the final volume:
   \[
   A_0 \cdot h_0 = A_f \cdot h_f
   \]
   where \(A_0\) is the initial cross-sectional area and \(A_f\) is the final cross-sectional area.

   The initial area \(A_0\) is:
   \[
   A_0 = \frac{\pi \cdot d^2}{4} = \frac{\pi \cdot (25)^2}{4} = 490.87 \, \text{mm}^2
   \]

   Solving for \(A_f\):
   \[
   A_f = \frac{A_0 \cdot h_0}{h_f} = \frac{490.87 \cdot 62.5}{37.5} \approx 817.45 \, \text{mm}^2
   \]

4. **Calculate the Load:**

   The load (\(F\)) required is given by:
   \[
   F = \sigma \cdot A_f
   \]

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   F = 499.2 \cdot 817.45 \approx 408,000 \, \text{N}
   \]

### Final Answer:

The load required to compress the specimen to a height of 37.5 mm is approximately \(408,000 \, \text{N}\).","The work metal has a strength  coefﬁ  cient $=415\,\mathrm{MPa}$ , and strain hardening exponent $=0.18$ . Use the Johnson  formula with $a=0.8$  and $b=1.5$  to estimate extrusion strain. Determine the  pressure applied to the end of the billet as the ram moves forward.  

Solution:  The ram pressure will be calculated at billet lengths of $L=75\,\mathrm{mm}$   (starting value), $L=50\,\mathrm{mm},L=25\,\mathrm{mm}$ , and $L=0$ . The ideal true strain,  extrusion strain using Johnson’s formula, and average ﬂ  ow stress are computed  as follows:  

$$
\epsilon=\ln r_{x}=\ln4.0=1.3863
$$  

![](images/48949a4efccbdf6f0258f662bfec4ba7b49ecd613f0c64611c73dc9fa99d95c4.jpg)  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\epsilon_{x}=0.8+1.5(1.3863)=2.8795}}\\ {{\displaystyle{\overline{{Y}}_{f}=\frac{415(1.3863)^{0.18}}{1.18}=373\;\mathrm{MPa}}}}\end{array}
$$  

$L=75\,\mathrm{mm}$ : With a die angle of  $90^{\mathrm{o}}$ , the billet metal is assumed to be forced  through the die opening almost immediately; thus, the calculation assumes  that maximum pressure is reached at the billet length of  $75\:\mathrm{mm}$ . For die angles  less than $90^{\circ}$ , the pressure would build to a maximum as in Figure 18.34 as the  starting billet is squeezed into the cone-shaped portion of the extrusion die.  Using Equation (18.23b),  

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}&{}&{p=373\left(2.8795+2\frac{75}{25}\right)=3312\;\mathrm{MPa}}\\ &{}&\\ &{}&{L=50\;\mathrm{mm};p=373\left(2.8795+2\frac{50}{25}\right)=2566\;\mathrm{MPa}}\\ &{}&\\ &{}&{L=25\;\mathrm{mm};p=373\left(2.8795+2\frac{25}{25}\right)=1820\;\mathrm{MPa}}\end{array}
$$  

$L=0$ : Zero length is a hypothetical value in direct extrusion. In reality, it is  impossible to squeeze all of the metal through the die opening. Instead, a por- tion of the billet (the “butt”) remains unextruded and the pressure begins to  increase rapidly as $L$  approaches zero. This increase in pressure at the end of  the stroke is seen in the plot of ram pressure versus ram stroke in Figure 18.34.  Calculated below is the hypothetical minimum value of ram pressure that  would result at  $L=0$ .  

$$
p=373\left(2.8795+2{\frac{0}{25}}\right)={\bf1074}\;{\bf M P a}
$$  

This is also the value of ram pressure that would be associated with indirect  extrusion throughout the length of the billet.  

# 18.5.3  EXTRUSION DIES AND PRESSES  

Important factors in an extrusion die are die angle and oriﬁ  ce shape. Die angle, more  precisely die half-angle, is shown as $\alpha$  in Figure 18.35(a). For low angles, surface area of  the die is large, leading to increased friction at the die-billet interface. Higher friction  results in larger ram force. On the other hand, a large die angle causes more turbulence  in the metal ﬂ  ow during reduction, increasing the ram force required. Thus, the effect  of die angle on ram force is a U-shaped function, as in Figure 18.35(b). An optimum  die angle exists, as suggested by the hypothetical plot. The optimum angle depends on  various factors (e.g., work material, billet temperature, and lubrication) and is therefore  difﬁ  cult to determine for a given extrusion job. During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}.

$ (b) Subtracting the $0.2\%$  offset, engineering strain  $e=(50.2-50.0)/50.0\;-

$ $0.002=0.002$ Rearranging Equation (3.3), modulus of elasticity  $E=s/e=160/0.002=$  

 $\mathbf{80,000\,M P a}$ .

 (c) Tensile strength $=$  maximum load divided by original area: 

 ${\cal T}S=65{,}000/200=325~\mathrm{M}\mathrm{Pa}$ .

 (d) By Equation (3.2), engineering strain at maximum load  $e=$

 (e) Deﬁ  ned in Equation (3.4), percent elongation $E L=(59.5-50)/50=$  

 $\mathbf{0.19}=\mathbf{19\%}$ .  

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the  

! To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

The yield strength is the stress at which the material begins to deform plastically, and it is typically determined using the 0.2% offset method.

### Given Data:
- Modulus of Elasticity, \( E = 30 \times 10^6 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \)
- Initial height, \( h_0 = 2.0 \, \text{in} \)
- Diameter, \( d = 1.5 \, \text{in} \)
- Yield load, \( F_y = 140,000 \, \text{lb} \)
- Load at reduced height, \( F = 260,000 \, \text{lb} \)
- Reduced height, \( h = 1.6 \, \text{in} \)

### Steps to Determine Yield Strength:

1. **Calculate the Original Cross-Sectional Area:**
   \[
   A_0 = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} = \frac{\pi (1.5)^2}{4} = \frac{\pi \times 2.25}{4} = 1.767 \, \text{in}^2
   \]

2. **Calculate the Yield Strength:**
   Yield strength is the stress at the yield point, which can be calculated using the yield load and the original cross-sectional area.
   \[
   \sigma_y = \frac{F_y}{A_0} = \frac{140,000}{1.767} = 79,222.8 \, \text{lb/in}^2
   \]

Thus, the yield strength of the steel test specimen is approximately \( 79,223 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \).

A tensile test specimen has a starting gage length $=50\:\mathrm{mm}$  and a cross-sectional  area $=200\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ . During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}. It is a constant of proportionality  whose value is different for different materials. Table 3.1 presents typical values for  several materials, metals and nonmetals.  

As stress increases, some point in the linear relationship is ﬁ  nally reached at  which the material begins to yield. This  yield point   $Y$ of the material can be identi- ﬁ  ed in the ﬁ  gure by the change in slope at the end of the linear region. Because the  start of yielding is usually difﬁ  cult to see in a plot of test data (it does not usually oc- cur as an abrupt change in slope), $Y$  is typically deﬁ  ned as the stress at which a strain  offset of  $0.2\%$  from the straight line has occurred. More speciﬁ  cally, it is the point  where the stress–strain curve for the material intersects a line that is parallel to the  straight portion of the curve but offset from it by a strain of $0.2\%$ . The yield point is a  strength characteristic of the material, and is therefore often referred to as the  yield  strength  (other names include  yield stress  and  elastic limit ).  

The yield point marks the transition to the plastic region and the start of plas- tic deformation of the material. The relationship between stress and strain is no  longer guided by Hooke’s law. As the load is increased beyond the yield point,  elongation of the specimen proceeds, but at a much faster rate than before, caus- ing the slope of the curve to change dramatically, as shown in Figure 3.3. Elonga- tion is accompanied by a uniform reduction in cross-sectional area, consistent  with maintaining constant volume. Finally, the applied load  $F$  reaches a maxi- mum value, and the engineering stress calculated at this point is called the  tensile

(They are also used in certain manufacturing calculations.) Some typical values  of yield strength and tensile strength are listed in Table 3.2 for selected metals.  Conventional tensile testing of ceramics is difﬁ  cult, and an alternative test is used  to measure the strength of these brittle materials (Section 3.1.3). Polymers differ  in their strength properties from metals and ceramics because of viscoelasticity  (Section 3.5).

"A bend test is used for a certain hard material. If the transverse rupture strength of the material is known to be 1000 MPa, what is the anticipated load at which the specimen is likely to fail, given that its width = 15 mm, thickness = 10 mm, and length = 60 mm?","Solution: F = (TRS)(bt^2)/1.5L = 1000(15 x 10^2)/(1.5 x 60) = 16,667 N.","To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the transverse rupture strength (TRS) in a bending test, which is given by:

\[
T R S = \frac{1.5 F L}{b t^2}
\]

Where:
- \( T R S \) is the transverse rupture strength, in MPa.
- \( F \) is the applied load at fracture, in N.
- \( L \) is the length of the specimen between supports, in mm.
- \( b \) is the width of the specimen, in mm.
- \( t \) is the thickness of the specimen, in mm.

We are given:
- \( T R S = 1000 \) MPa
- \( b = 15 \) mm
- \( t = 10 \) mm
- \( L = 60 \) mm

We need to find the load \( F \) at which the specimen is likely to fail. Rearranging the formula to solve for \( F \), we get:

\[
F = \frac{T R S \cdot b \cdot t^2}{1.5 \cdot L}
\]

Substituting the given values into the equation:

\[
F = \frac{1000 \cdot 15 \cdot 10^2}{1.5 \cdot 60}
\]

Calculating step-by-step:

1. Calculate \( t^2 \):
   \[
   t^2 = 10^2 = 100
   \]

2. Calculate the numerator:
   \[
   1000 \cdot 15 \cdot 100 = 1,500,000
   \]

3. Calculate the denominator:
   \[
   1.5 \cdot 60 = 90
   \]

4. Divide the numerator by the denominator to find \( F \):
   \[
   F = \frac{1,500,000}{90} = 16,666.67 \, \text{N}
   \]

Therefore, the anticipated load at which the specimen is likely to fail is approximately \( 16,667 \, \text{N} \).","[](images/4fa9287e7e474f4387d790a053742a087536a2b5fe6d46af83a3ed15bed0f89e.jpg)

load. These materials do not respond well to traditional tensile testing because of  problems in preparing the test specimens and possible misalignment of the press  jaws that hold the specimen. The  bending test  (also known as the  ﬂ  exure test ) is  used to test the strength of these materials, using a setup illustrated in the ﬁ  rst  diagram in Figure 3.10. In this procedure, a specimen of rectangular cross section  is positioned between two supports, and a load is applied at its center. In this con- ﬁ  guration, the test is called a three-point bending test. A four-point conﬁ  guration  is also sometimes used. These brittle materials do not ﬂ  ex to the exaggerated ex- tent shown in Figure 3.10; instead they deform elastically until immediately be- fore fracture. Failure usually occurs because the ultimate tensile strength of the  outer ﬁ  bers of the specimen has been exceeded. This results in  cleavage , a failure  mode associated with ceramics and metals operating at low service temperatures,  in which separation rather than slip occurs along certain crystallographic planes.  The strength value derived from this test is called the  transverse rupture strength ,  calculated from the formula  

$$
T R S={\frac{1.5F L}{b t^{2}}}
$$  

where  $T R S=$  transverse rupture strength, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  applied load at fracture,  N (lb); $L=$ length of the specimen between supports, mm (in); and  $b$  and  $t$  are the  dimensions of the cross section of the specimen as shown in the ﬁ  gure, mm (in).  

The ﬂ  exure test is also used for certain nonbrittle materials such as thermoplastic  polymers. In this case, because the material is likely to deform rather than fracture,  TRS cannot be determined based on failure of the specimen. Instead, either of two  measures is used: (1) the load recorded at a given level of deﬂ  ection, or (2) the de- ﬂ  ection observed at a given load.  

# 3.1.4 SHEAR PROPERTIES  

Shear involves application of stresses in opposite directions on either side of a thin  element to deﬂ  ect it as shown in Figure 3.11. The shear stress is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\tau={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

![](images/54903b7bc86140704dc9a1b301a1623b6698845dbec06069b59ac3b86084a573.jpg)  

where  $\tau=$  shear stress,  $\mathrm{lb/in^{2}}$  (MPa);  $F=$  applied force,  $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A=$  area over  which the force is applied, $\mathrm{in}^{2}\left(\mathrm{mm}^{2}\right)$ . Shear strain can be deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\gamma=\frac{\delta}{b}
$$  

where  $\gamma=$  shear strain, $\mathrm{mm/mm}\;(\mathrm{in/in});\delta=$ the deﬂ  ection of the element, mm (in);  and $b=$  the orthogonal distance over which deﬂ  ection occurs, mm (in).  

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12. As torque  is increased, the tube deﬂ  ects by twisting, which is a shear strain for this geometry. To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

Despite these difﬁ  culties, percent elongation and percent area reduction  are the most commonly used measures of ductility in engineering practice.

A tensile test specimen has a starting gage length $=50\:\mathrm{mm}$  and a cross-sectional  area $=200\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ .

The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ .

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation.

A special ceramic specimen is tested in a bend test. Its width = 0.50 in and thickness = 0.25 in. The length of the specimen between supports = 2.0 in. Determine the transverse rupture strength if failure occurs at a load = 1700 lb.,"Solution: TRS = 1.5FL/bt^2 = 1.5(1700)(2.0)/(0.5 x 0.25^2) = 163,200 lb/in2.","To determine the transverse rupture strength (TRS) of the ceramic specimen in a bend test, we will use the formula provided for TRS:

\[
T R S = \frac{1.5 \cdot F \cdot L}{b \cdot t^2}
\]

where:
- \( F \) is the applied load at fracture, in pounds (lb).
- \( L \) is the length of the specimen between supports, in inches (in).
- \( b \) is the width of the specimen, in inches (in).
- \( t \) is the thickness of the specimen, in inches (in).

Given values:
- \( F = 1700 \, \text{lb} \)
- \( L = 2.0 \, \text{in} \)
- \( b = 0.50 \, \text{in} \)
- \( t = 0.25 \, \text{in} \)

Now, substitute these values into the formula:

\[
T R S = \frac{1.5 \cdot 1700 \cdot 2.0}{0.50 \cdot (0.25)^2}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
0.50 \cdot (0.25)^2 = 0.50 \cdot 0.0625 = 0.03125
\]

Now, calculate the numerator:

\[
1.5 \cdot 1700 \cdot 2.0 = 5100
\]

Finally, divide the numerator by the denominator to find the TRS:

\[
T R S = \frac{5100}{0.03125} = 163200 \, \text{lb/in}^2
\]

Therefore, the transverse rupture strength of the ceramic specimen is \( 163200 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \).","[](images/4fa9287e7e474f4387d790a053742a087536a2b5fe6d46af83a3ed15bed0f89e.jpg)

- Radius, \( R = 25 \, \text{mm} \)
- Wall thickness, \( t = 3 \, \text{mm} \)
- Gage length, \( L = 50 \, \text{mm} \)
- Torque, \( T = 900 \, \text{N-m} = 900 \times 10^3 \, \text{N-mm} \) (since 1 N-m = 1000 N-mm)
- Angular deflection, \( \alpha = 0.3 \, \text{radians} \)

### (a) Calculate the Shear Stress (\( \tau \))

The formula for shear stress in a torsion test is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{T}{2\pi R^2 t}
\]

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[
\tau = \frac{900 \times 10^3}{2\pi (25)^2 (3)}
\]

Calculate the denominator:

\[
2\pi (25)^2 (3) = 2 \times 3.1416 \times 625 \times 3 = 11781.6
\]

Now, calculate the shear stress:

\[
\tau = \frac{900 \times 10^3}{11781.6} \approx 76.39 \, \text{MPa}
\]

### (b) Calculate the Shear Strain (\( \gamma \))

The formula for shear strain in a torsion test is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{R \alpha}{L}
\]

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[
\gamma = \frac{25 \times 0.3}{50}
\]

Calculate the shear strain:

\[
\gamma = \frac{7.5}{50} = 0.15 \, \text{mm/mm}
\]

### Final Answers:
- (a) The shear stress is approximately \( 76.39 \, \text{MPa} \).
- (b) The shear strain is \( 0.15 \, \text{mm/mm} \).","Shear strain can be deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\gamma=\frac{\delta}{b}
$$  

where  $\gamma=$  shear strain, $\mathrm{mm/mm}\;(\mathrm{in/in});\delta=$ the deﬂ  ection of the element, mm (in);  and $b=$  the orthogonal distance over which deﬂ  ection occurs, mm (in).  

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12. As torque  is increased, the tube deﬂ  ects by twisting, which is a shear strain for this geometry. The shear stress can be determined in the test by the equation  

$$
\tau=\frac{T}{2\pi R^{2}t}
$$  

where  $T=$  applied torque,  $\mathrm{N{-mm}}$  (lb-in);  $R\,=$ radius of the tube measured to the  neutral axis of the wall, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and $t=$  wall thickness, mm (in). The shear strain can  be determined by measuring the amount of angular deﬂ  ection of the tube, convert- ing this into a distance deﬂ  ected, and dividing by the gauge length  $L$ . Reducing this  to a simple expression,  

$$
\gamma={\frac{R\alpha}{L}}
$$  

where  $\upalpha=$  the angular deﬂ  ection (radians).  

A typical shear stress–strain curve is shown in Figure 3.13. In the elastic region,  the relationship is deﬁ  ned by  

$$
\tau=G\gamma
$$

where  $G\,=$  the  shear modulus , or  shear modulus of elasticity , MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ . For  most materials, the shear modulus can be approximated by  $G=0.4E$ , where  $E$  is the  conventional elastic modulus.  

In the plastic region of the shear stress–strain curve, the material strain hardens  to cause the applied torque to continue to increase until fracture ﬁ  nally   occurs.  The relationship in this region is similar to the ﬂ  ow curve. The shear stress at  fracture can be calculated and this is used as the  shear strength $S$  of the material.  Shear strength can be estimated from tensile strength data by the approximation:  $S=0.7(T S)$ .  

Because the cross-sectional area of the test specimen in the torsion test does not  change as it does in the tensile and compression tests, the engineering stress–strain  curve for shear derived from the torsion test is virtually the same as the true stress– strain curve.  

Shear processes are common in industry. Shearing action is used to cut sheet metal  in blanking, punching, and other cutting operations (Section 19.1). In machining, the  material is removed by the mechanism of shear deformation (Section 20.2).  

The hardness of a material is deﬁ  ned as its resistance to permanent indentation.  Good hardness generally means that the material is resistant to scratching and wear.  For many engineering applications, including most of the tooling used in manufac- turing, scratch and wear resistance are important characteristics. As the reader shall  see later in this section, there is a strong correlation between hardness and strength.  

3.2.1  HARDNESS TESTS  

Hardness tests are commonly used for assessing material properties because they  are quick and convenient. However, a variety of testing methods are appropriate  because of differences in hardness among different materials. The best-known hard- ness tests are Brinell and Rockwell. During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}.

$ (b) Subtracting the $0.2\%$  offset, engineering strain  $e=(50.2-50.0)/50.0\;-

$ $0.002=0.002$ Rearranging Equation (3.3), modulus of elasticity  $E=s/e=160/0.002=$  

 $\mathbf{80,000\,M P a}$ .

 (c) Tensile strength $=$  maximum load divided by original area: 

 ${\cal T}S=65{,}000/200=325~\mathrm{M}\mathrm{Pa}$ .

 (d) By Equation (3.2), engineering strain at maximum load  $e=$  

 $(57.7-50)/50={\bf0.154}$ .

 (e) Deﬁ  ned in Equation (3.4), percent elongation $E L=(59.5-50)/50=$  

 $\mathbf{0.19}=\mathbf{19\%}$ .  

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the

load. These materials do not respond well to traditional tensile testing because of  problems in preparing the test specimens and possible misalignment of the press  jaws that hold the specimen. The  bending test  (also known as the  ﬂ  exure test ) is  used to test the strength of these materials, using a setup illustrated in the ﬁ  rst  diagram in Figure 3.10. In this procedure, a specimen of rectangular cross section  is positioned between two supports, and a load is applied at its center. In this con- ﬁ  guration, the test is called a three-point bending test. A four-point conﬁ  guration  is also sometimes used. These brittle materials do not ﬂ  ex to the exaggerated ex- tent shown in Figure 3.10; instead they deform elastically until immediately be- fore fracture. Failure usually occurs because the ultimate tensile strength of the  outer ﬁ  bers of the specimen has been exceeded. This results in  cleavage , a failure  mode associated with ceramics and metals operating at low service temperatures,  in which separation rather than slip occurs along certain crystallographic planes.  The strength value derived from this test is called the  transverse rupture strength ,  calculated from the formula  

$$
T R S={\frac{1.5F L}{b t^{2}}}
$$  

where  $T R S=$  transverse rupture strength, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  applied load at fracture,  N (lb); $L=$ length of the specimen between supports, mm (in); and  $b$  and  $t$  are the  dimensions of the cross section of the specimen as shown in the ﬁ  gure, mm (in).  

The ﬂ  exure test is also used for certain nonbrittle materials such as thermoplastic  polymers. In this case, because the material is likely to deform rather than fracture,  TRS cannot be determined based on failure of the specimen. Instead, either of two  measures is used: (1) the load recorded at a given level of deﬂ  ection, or (2) the de- ﬂ  ection observed at a given load.  

# 3.1.4 SHEAR PROPERTIES  

Shear involves application of stresses in opposite directions on either side of a thin  element to deﬂ  ect it as shown in Figure 3.11. The shear stress is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\tau={\frac{F}{A}}
$$

where  $\tau=$  shear stress,  $\mathrm{lb/in^{2}}$  (MPa);  $F=$  applied force,  $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A=$  area over  which the force is applied, $\mathrm{in}^{2}\left(\mathrm{mm}^{2}\right)$ . Shear strain can be deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\gamma=\frac{\delta}{b}

where  $\gamma=$  shear strain, $\mathrm{mm/mm}\;(\mathrm{in/in});\delta=$ the deﬂ  ection of the element, mm (in);  and $b=$  the orthogonal distance over which deﬂ  ection occurs, mm (in).

"In a torsion test, a torque of 5000 ft-lb is applied which causes an angular deflection = 1q on a thin-walled tubular specimen whose radius = 1.5 in, wall thickness = 0.10 in, and gage length = 2.0 in. Determine (a) the shear stress, (b) shear strain","Solution: (a) W = T/(2piR2t) = (5000 x 12)/(2pi(1.5)^2(0.1)) = 42,441 lb/in2. (b) J = RD/L, D = 1(2pi/360) = 0.01745 rad., J = 1.5(0.01745)/2.0 = 0.01309  ","To solve this problem, we need to determine both the shear stress and shear strain for the given torsion test conditions. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Data:
- Torque, \( T = 5000 \, \text{ft-lb} \)
- Angular deflection, \( \alpha = 1^\circ \)
- Radius, \( R = 1.5 \, \text{in} \)
- Wall thickness, \( t = 0.10 \, \text{in} \)
- Gauge length, \( L = 2.0 \, \text{in} \)

### Conversion:
First, we need to convert the torque from ft-lb to in-lb because the other dimensions are in inches.
\[ 1 \, \text{ft} = 12 \, \text{in} \]
\[ T = 5000 \, \text{ft-lb} \times 12 \, \text{in/ft} = 60000 \, \text{in-lb} \]

Also, convert the angular deflection from degrees to radians:
\[ 1^\circ = \frac{\pi}{180} \, \text{radians} \]
\[ \alpha = 1^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{\pi}{180} \, \text{radians} \]

### (a) Shear Stress:
The formula for shear stress in a torsion test is given by:
\[ \tau = \frac{T}{2\pi R^2 t} \]

Substitute the given values:
\[ \tau = \frac{60000 \, \text{in-lb}}{2\pi (1.5 \, \text{in})^2 (0.10 \, \text{in})} \]

Calculate:
\[ \tau = \frac{60000}{2\pi \times 2.25 \times 0.10} \]
\[ \tau = \frac{60000}{1.4137} \]
\[ \tau \approx 42441.3 \, \text{psi} \]

### (b) Shear Strain:
The formula for shear strain is:
\[ \gamma = \frac{R\alpha}{L} \]

Substitute the given values:
\[ \gamma = \frac{1.5 \, \text{in} \times \frac{\pi}{180}}{2.0 \, \text{in}} \]

Calculate:
\[ \gamma = \frac{1.5 \times \frac{\pi}{180}}{2.0} \]
\[ \gamma = \frac{1.5 \times 0.0174533}{2.0} \]
\[ \gamma = \frac{0.0261799}{2.0} \]
\[ \gamma \approx 0.01309 \, \text{in/in} \]

### Final Answers:

where  $T R S=$  transverse rupture strength, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  applied load at fracture,  N (lb); $L=$ length of the specimen between supports, mm (in); and  $b$  and  $t$  are the  dimensions of the cross section of the specimen as shown in the ﬁ  gure, mm (in).  

The ﬂ  exure test is also used for certain nonbrittle materials such as thermoplastic  polymers. In this case, because the material is likely to deform rather than fracture,  TRS cannot be determined based on failure of the specimen. Instead, either of two  measures is used: (1) the load recorded at a given level of deﬂ  ection, or (2) the de- ﬂ  ection observed at a given load.  

# 3.1.4 SHEAR PROPERTIES  

Shear involves application of stresses in opposite directions on either side of a thin  element to deﬂ  ect it as shown in Figure 3.11. The shear stress is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\tau={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

![](images/54903b7bc86140704dc9a1b301a1623b6698845dbec06069b59ac3b86084a573.jpg)  

where  $\tau=$  shear stress,  $\mathrm{lb/in^{2}}$  (MPa);  $F=$  applied force,  $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A=$  area over  which the force is applied, $\mathrm{in}^{2}\left(\mathrm{mm}^{2}\right)$ . Shear strain can be deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\gamma=\frac{\delta}{b}
$$  

where  $\gamma=$  shear strain, $\mathrm{mm/mm}\;(\mathrm{in/in});\delta=$ the deﬂ  ection of the element, mm (in);  and $b=$  the orthogonal distance over which deﬂ  ection occurs, mm (in).  

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12. As torque  is increased, the tube deﬂ  ects by twisting, which is a shear strain for this geometry. This shear plane area can be calculated as  

$$
A_{s}=\frac{t_{o}w}{\sin\!\phi}
$$  

The shear stress in Equation (20.7) represents the level of stress required to per- form the machining operation. Therefore, this stress is equal to the shear strength of  the work material  $(\tau=S)$ ) under the conditions at which cutting occurs.  

Vector addition of the two force components  $F_{s}$  and  $F_{n}$  yields the resultant force  $R^{\prime}$ . In order for the forces acting on the chip to balance, this resultant  $R^{\prime}$  must be  equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and collinear with the resultant  $R$ .  

None of the four force components  $F,N,F_{s}$ , and $F_{n}$  can be directly measured  in a machining operation, because the directions in which they are applied vary  with different tool geometries and cutting conditions. However, it is possible  for the cutting tool to be instrumented using a force measuring device called a  dynamometer, so that two additional force components acting against the tool  can be directly measured: cutting force and thrust force. The  cutting force   $F_{c}$  is  in the direction of cutting, the same direction as the cutting speed  $\nu$ , and the  thrust force   $F_{t}$  is perpendicular to the cutting force and is associated with the  chip thickness before the cut $t_{o}$ . The cutting force and thrust force are shown in  Figure 20.10(b) together with their resultant force  $R^{\prime\prime}$ . The respective directions  of these forces are known, so the force transducers in the dynamometer can be  aligned accordingly.  

Equations can be derived to relate the four force components that cannot be meas- ured to the two forces that can be measured. Using the force diagram in Figure 20.11,  the following trigonometric relationships can be derived:  

If cutting force and thrust force are known, these four equations can be used to  calculate estimates of shear force, friction force, and normal force to friction. Based  on these force estimates, shear stress and coefﬁ  cient of friction can be determined.  

Note that in the special case of orthogonal cutting when the rake angle  $\alpha\,=\,0$ ,  Equations (20.9) and (20.10) reduce to  $\boldsymbol{F}=\boldsymbol{F}_{\iota}$  and $N=F_{c}$ , respectively. Thus, in this  special case, friction force and its normal force could be directly measured by the  dynamometer.  

# Example 20.2  Shear stress in  machining  

Suppose in Example 20.1 that cutting force and thrust force are measured dur- ing an orthogonal cutting operation: $F_{c}=1559\,\mathrm{N}$  and $F_{t}=1271$  N. The width  of the orthogonal cutting operation $w=3.0\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Based on these data, deter- mine the shear strength of the work material.  

Solution:  From Example 20.1, rake angle $\alpha=10^{\circ}$ , and shear plane angle $\phi=$ $25.4^{\circ}$ . Shear force can be computed from Equation (20.11):  

$$
F_{s}=1559\cos25.4-1271\sin25.4=863\:\mathrm{N}
$$  

The shear plane area is given by Equation (20.8):  

$$
A_{s}={\frac{(0.5)(3.0)}{\sin25.4}}=3.497\:\mathrm{mm}^{2}
$$  

Thus the shear stress, which equals the shear strength of the work material, is  

$$
\tau=S={\frac{863}{3.497}}=247\;\mathrm{N}/\mathrm{mm}^{2}=247\;\mathrm{MPa}
$$

For a tested hardness of HB = 182, TS = 500(182) = 91,000 lb/in2.","To solve the given problem, we need to calculate the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN) using the provided formula and then estimate the tensile strength of the steel using the correlation between BHN and tensile strength.

### (a) Determine the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN)

The formula for calculating the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN) is:

\[
HB = \frac{2F}{\pi D_b (D_b - \sqrt{D_b^2 - D_i^2})}
\]

Where:
- \( F = 1500 \, \text{kg} \) (indentation load)
- \( D_b = 10 \, \text{mm} \) (diameter of the ball)
- \( D_i = 3.2 \, \text{mm} \) (diameter of the indentation)

Substitute the values into the formula:

1. Calculate \( D_b^2 - D_i^2 \):

\[
D_b^2 - D_i^2 = 10^2 - 3.2^2 = 100 - 10.24 = 89.76
\]

2. Calculate \( \sqrt{D_b^2 - D_i^2} \):

\[
\sqrt{89.76} \approx 9.475
\]

3. Substitute into the BHN formula:

\[
HB = \frac{2 \times 1500}{\pi \times 10 \times (10 - 9.475)}
\]

4. Simplify the expression:

\[
HB = \frac{3000}{\pi \times 10 \times 0.525}
\]

5. Calculate the denominator:

\[
\pi \times 10 \times 0.525 \approx 16.493
\]

6. Calculate the BHN:

\[
HB = \frac{3000}{16.493} \approx 181.96
\]

Thus, the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN) is approximately 182.

### (b) Estimate the tensile strength of the steel

The relationship between the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN) and the tensile strength (TS) for steel is given by:

\[
TS = K_h \times HB
\]

Where:
- \( K_h = 3.45 \) (when TS is expressed in MPa)

Substitute the BHN value into the formula:

\[
TS = 3.45 \times 182 \approx 627.9 \, \text{MPa}
\]

Therefore, the estimated tensile strength of the steel is approximately 628 MPa.

### Final Answers:
(a) The Brinell Hardness Number (BHN) is approximately 182.  
(b) The estimated tensile strength of the steel is approximately 628 MPa.","In machining, the  material is removed by the mechanism of shear deformation (Section 20.2).  

The hardness of a material is deﬁ  ned as its resistance to permanent indentation.  Good hardness generally means that the material is resistant to scratching and wear.  For many engineering applications, including most of the tooling used in manufac- turing, scratch and wear resistance are important characteristics. As the reader shall  see later in this section, there is a strong correlation between hardness and strength.  

3.2.1  HARDNESS TESTS  

Hardness tests are commonly used for assessing material properties because they  are quick and convenient. However, a variety of testing methods are appropriate  because of differences in hardness among different materials. The best-known hard- ness tests are Brinell and Rockwell.  

Brinell Hardness Test  The Brinell hardness test is widely used for testing metals  and nonmetals of low- to medium hardness. It is named after the Swedish engineer  who developed it around 1900. In the test, a hardened steel (or cemented carbide)  ball of $10{\mathrm{-mm}}$  diameter is pressed into the surface of a specimen using a load of 500,  1500, or  $3000~\mathrm{kg}$ . The load is then divided into the indentation area to obtain the  Brinell Hardness Number (BHN). In equation form,  

$$
H B=\frac{2F}{\pi D_{b}(D_{b}-\sqrt{D_{b}^{2}-D_{i}^{2}})}
$$  

where  $H B\;=$ Brinell Hardness Number (BHN);  $F\,=$  indentation load, kg;  $D_{b}\,=$ diameter of the ball, mm; and $D_{i}=$  diameter of the indentation on the surface, mm.  

These dimensions are indicated in Figure 3.14(a). The resulting BHN has units  of $\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ , but the units are usually omitted in expressing the number. For harder  materials (above $500\:\mathrm{BHN}$ ), the cemented carbide ball is used because the steel ball  experiences elastic deformation that compromises the accuracy of the reading. Also,  higher loads (1500 and $3000\;\mathrm{kg}$ ) are typically used for harder materials. Because of  differences in results under different loads, it is considered good practice to indicate  the load used in the test when reporting $H B$  readings.  

Rockwell Hardness Test  This is another widely used test, named after the met- allurgist who developed it in the early 1920s. It is convenient to use, and several  enhancements over the years have made the test adaptable to a variety of materials.  

In the Rockwell Hardness Test, a cone-shaped indenter or small-diameter ball,  with diameter $=1.6$  or  $3.2~\mathrm{mm}$  (1/16 or 1/8 in) is pressed into the specimen using  a minor load of $10\,\mathrm{kg}$ , thus seating the indenter in the material. Then, a major load  of  $150~\mathrm{kg}$  (or other value) is applied, causing the indenter to penetrate into the

specimen a certain distance beyond its initial position. This additional penetration  distance  $d$  is converted into a Rockwell hardness reading by the testing machine.  The sequence is depicted in Figure 3.14(b). Differences in load and indenter ge- ometry provide various Rockwell scales for different materials. The most common  scales are indicated in Table 3.5.

# 3.2.2  HARDNESS OF VARIOUS MATERIALS  

This section compares the hardness values of some common materials in the three  engineering material classes: metals, ceramics, and polymers.  

Metals  The Brinell and Rockwell hardness tests were developed at a time when  metals were the principal engineering materials. A signiﬁ  cant amount of data has been  collected using these tests on metals. Table 3.6 lists hardness values for selected metals.  

For most metals, hardness is closely related to strength. Because the method of  testing for hardness is usually based on resistance to indentation, which is a form of  compression, one would expect a good correlation between hardness and strength  properties determined in a compression test. However, strength properties in a com- pression test are nearly the same as those from a tension test, after allowances for  changes in cross-sectional area of the respective test specimens; so the correlation  with tensile properties should also be good.  

Brinell hardness  $(H B)$  exhibits a close correlation with the ultimate tensile  strength  TS  of steels, leading to the relationship [9], [15]:

where  $K_{h}$  is a constant of proportionality. If  $T S$  is expressed in MPa, then  $K_{h}=3.45$ ;  and if  TS  is in $\mathrm{{lb/in^{2}}}$ , then $K_{h}=500$ .  

Ceramics  The Brinell hardness test is not appropriate for ceramics because the  materials being tested are often harder than the indenter ball. The Vickers and  Knoop hardness tests are used to test these hard materials. Table 3.7 lists hardness  values for several ceramics and hard materials. For comparison, the Rockwell C  hardness for hardened tool steel is 65 HRC. The HRC scale does not extend high  enough to be used for the harder materials.  

Polymers  Polymers have the lowest hardness among the three types of engineer- ing materials. Table 3.8 lists several of the polymers on the Brinell hardness scale, al- though this testing method is not normally used for these materials. It does, however,  allow comparison with the hardness of metals.  

# 3.3 3.3  Effect of Temperature on Properties  

Temperature has a signiﬁ  cant effect on nearly all properties of a material. It is im- portant for the designer to know the material properties at the operating tempera- tures of the product when in service. TABLE  •  3.5  Common Rockwell hardness scales.

specimen a certain distance beyond its initial position. This additional penetration  distance  $d$  is converted into a Rockwell hardness reading by the testing machine.  The sequence is depicted in Figure 3.14(b). Differences in load and indenter ge- ometry provide various Rockwell scales for different materials. The most common  scales are indicated in Table 3.5.  

Vickers Hardness Test  This test, also developed in the early 1920s, uses a pyra- mid-shaped indenter made of diamond. It is based on the principle that impressions  made by this indenter are geometrically similar regardless of load. Accordingly,  loads of various size are applied, depending on the hardness of the material to be  measured. The Vickers Hardness  $(H V)$  is then determined from the formula  

$$
H V={\frac{1.854\,F}{D^{2}}}
$$  

where  $F=$  applied load, $\mathrm{kg}$ , and $D=$  the diagonal of the impression made by the  indenter, mm, as indicated in Figure 3.14(c). The Vickers test can be used for all met- als and has one of the widest scales among hardness tests.  

Knoop Hardness Test  The Knoop test, developed in 1939, uses a pyramid-shaped  diamond indenter, but the pyramid has a length-to-width ratio of about 7:1, as indi- cated in Figure 3.14(d), and the applied loads are generally lighter than in the Vick- ers test. It is a microhardness test, meaning that it is suitable for measuring small,  thin specimens or hard materials that might fracture if a heavier load were applied.  The indenter shape facilitates reading of the impression under the lighter loads used  in this test. The Knoop hardness value ( HK ) is determined according to the formula  

$$
H K=14.2\,\frac{F}{D^{2}}
$$  

where  $F=\mathrm{load},\mathrm{kg}$ ; and  $D=$  the long diagonal of the indentor, mm. Because the  impression made in this test is generally very small, considerable care must be taken  in preparing the surface to be measured.  

Scleroscope  The previous tests base their hardness measurements either on the  ratio of applied load divided by the resulting impression area (Brinell, Vickers, and  Knoop) or by the depth of the impression (Rockwell). The Scleroscope is an in- strument that measures the rebound height of a “hammer” dropped from a certain  distance above the surface of the material to be tested. The hammer consists of a  weight with diamond indenter attached to it. The Scleroscope therefore measures  the mechanical energy absorbed by the material when the indenter strikes the sur- face. The energy absorbed gives an indication of resistance to penetration, which is  consistent with the deﬁ  nition of hardness. If more energy is absorbed, the rebound  will be less, meaning a softer material. If less energy is absorbed, the rebound will be  higher—thus a harder material. The primary use of the Scleroscope seems to be in  measuring the hardness of large parts of steel and other ferrous metals.  

Durometer  The previous tests are all based on resistance to permanent or plastic  deformation (indentation). The durometer is a device that measures the elastic de- formation of rubber and similar ﬂ  exible materials by pressing an indenter into the  surface of the object. The resistance to penetration is an indication of hardness, as  the term is applied to these types of materials.

"One of the inspectors in the quality control department has frequently used the Brinell and Rockwell hardness tests, for which equipment is available in the company. He claims that all hardness tests are based on the same principle as the Brinell test, which is that hardness is always measured as the applied load divided by the area of the impressions made by an indentor. (a) Is he correct? (b) If not, what are some of the other principles involved in hardness testing, and what are the associated tests?","Solution: (a) No, the claim is not correct. Not all hardness tests are based on the applied load divided by area, but many of them are. (b) Some of the other hardness tests and operating principles include: (1) Rockwell hardness test, which measures the depth of indentation of a cone resulting from an applied load; (2) Scleroscope, which measures the rebound height of a hammer dropped from a certain distance against a surface specimen; and (3) Durometer, which measures elastic deformation by pressing an indentor into the surface of rubber and similar soft materials.","To address the inspector's claim, we need to evaluate the principles behind different hardness tests and determine whether they all follow the same principle as the Brinell test. Let's break down the problem:

### (a) Is the inspector correct?

The inspector claims that all hardness tests are based on the principle of measuring hardness as the applied load divided by the area of the impressions made by an indenter. This is indeed the principle behind the Brinell hardness test, where the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN) is calculated using the formula:

\[ 
HB = \frac{2F}{\pi D_b (D_b - \sqrt{D_b^2 - D_i^2})} 
\]

where:
- \( F \) is the indentation load,
- \( D_b \) is the diameter of the ball,
- \( D_i \) is the diameter of the indentation.

However, not all hardness tests follow this exact principle. Therefore, the inspector is not entirely correct.

### (b) If not, what are some of the other principles involved in hardness testing, and what are the associated tests?

1. **Rockwell Hardness Test:**
   - **Principle:** The Rockwell test measures hardness based on the depth of penetration of an indenter under a large load compared to the penetration made by a preliminary minor load. The hardness value is derived from the additional penetration depth.
   - **Associated Test:** Rockwell hardness test, which uses different scales (e.g., HRA, HRB, HRC) depending on the indenter type and load.

2. **Vickers Hardness Test:**
   - **Principle:** Similar to Brinell, the Vickers test measures hardness as the applied load divided by the surface area of the indentation. However, it uses a diamond pyramid-shaped indenter.
   - **Associated Test:** Vickers hardness test, with the formula:
     \[
     HV = \frac{1.854 \times F}{D^2}
     \]
   - Here, \( D \) is the diagonal of the impression.

3. **Knoop Hardness Test:**
   - **Principle:** Like Vickers, it measures hardness as the applied load divided by the area of the indentation, but it uses an elongated diamond indenter.
   - **Associated Test:** Knoop hardness test, with the formula:
     \[
     HK = 14.2 \times \frac{F}{D^2}
     \]
   - Here, \( D \) is the long diagonal of the indentation.

4. **Scleroscope Test:**
   - **Principle:** This test measures hardness based on the rebound height of a diamond-tipped hammer dropped from a fixed height onto the material. It assesses the energy absorbed by the material.
   - **Associated Test:** Scleroscope hardness test.

5. **Durometer Test:**
   - **Principle:** This test measures the elastic deformation of materials like rubber by pressing an indenter into the surface and assessing the resistance to penetration.
   - **Associated Test:** Durometer hardness test.

### Conclusion

The inspector's claim is not entirely correct. While the Brinell test measures hardness as the applied load divided by the area of the indentation, other tests like Rockwell, Scleroscope, and Durometer use different principles such as depth of penetration, rebound height, and elastic deformation. Each test is suited for different materials and applications, highlighting the diversity in hardness testing methodologies.","In machining, the  material is removed by the mechanism of shear deformation (Section 20.2).  

The hardness of a material is deﬁ  ned as its resistance to permanent indentation.  Good hardness generally means that the material is resistant to scratching and wear.  For many engineering applications, including most of the tooling used in manufac- turing, scratch and wear resistance are important characteristics. As the reader shall  see later in this section, there is a strong correlation between hardness and strength.

The primary use of the Scleroscope seems to be in  measuring the hardness of large parts of steel and other ferrous metals.

Ceramics  The Brinell hardness test is not appropriate for ceramics because the  materials being tested are often harder than the indenter ball. The Vickers and  Knoop hardness tests are used to test these hard materials. Table 3.7 lists hardness  values for several ceramics and hard materials. For comparison, the Rockwell C  hardness for hardened tool steel is 65 HRC. The HRC scale does not extend high  enough to be used for the harder materials.  

Polymers  Polymers have the lowest hardness among the three types of engineer- ing materials. Table 3.8 lists several of the polymers on the Brinell hardness scale, al- though this testing method is not normally used for these materials. It does, however,  allow comparison with the hardness of metals.  

# 3.3 3.3  Effect of Temperature on Properties

"A batch of annealed steel has just been received from the vendor. It is supposed to have a tensile strength in the range 60,000 -70,000 lb/in2. A Brinell hardness test in the receiving department yields a value of HB = 118. (a) Does the steel meet the specification on tensile strength?","Solution: (a) TS = 500(HB) = 500(118) = 59,000 lb/in2. This lies outside the specified range of 60,000 to 70,000 lb/in2. However, from a legal standpoint, it is unlikely that the batch can be rejected on the basis of its measured Brinell hardness number without using an actual tensile test to measure TS. The formula for converting from Brinell hardness number to tensile strength is only an approximating equation. ","To determine if the annealed steel meets the specification on tensile strength, we can use the relationship between Brinell hardness (HB) and tensile strength (TS) for steels. The relationship is given by:

\[ TS = K_h \times HB \]

where \( K_h \) is a constant of proportionality. For tensile strength expressed in psi (pounds per square inch), \( K_h = 500 \).

Given:
- Brinell hardness, \( HB = 118 \)
- \( K_h = 500 \)

We can calculate the tensile strength as follows:

\[ TS = 500 \times 118 \]

\[ TS = 59,000 \, \text{psi} \]

Now, let's compare this calculated tensile strength with the specified range of 60,000 - 70,000 psi.

The calculated tensile strength of 59,000 psi is slightly below the specified range of 60,000 - 70,000 psi. Therefore, the steel does not meet the specification on tensile strength.

**Final Answer: No, the steel does not meet the specification on tensile strength. The calculated tensile strength is 59,000 psi, which is below the specified range of 60,000 - 70,000 psi.**","To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction.

The resistance to penetration is an indication of hardness, as  the term is applied to these types of materials.  

# 3.2.2  HARDNESS OF VARIOUS MATERIALS  

This section compares the hardness values of some common materials in the three  engineering material classes: metals, ceramics, and polymers.  

Metals  The Brinell and Rockwell hardness tests were developed at a time when  metals were the principal engineering materials. A signiﬁ  cant amount of data has been  collected using these tests on metals. Table 3.6 lists hardness values for selected metals.  

For most metals, hardness is closely related to strength. Because the method of  testing for hardness is usually based on resistance to indentation, which is a form of  compression, one would expect a good correlation between hardness and strength  properties determined in a compression test. However, strength properties in a com- pression test are nearly the same as those from a tension test, after allowances for  changes in cross-sectional area of the respective test specimens; so the correlation  with tensile properties should also be good.  

Brinell hardness  $(H B)$  exhibits a close correlation with the ultimate tensile  strength  TS  of steels, leading to the relationship [9], [15]:

Temperature has a signiﬁ  cant effect on nearly all properties of a material. It is im- portant for the designer to know the material properties at the operating tempera- tures of the product when in service. In machining, the  material is removed by the mechanism of shear deformation (Section 20.2).  

The hardness of a material is deﬁ  ned as its resistance to permanent indentation.  Good hardness generally means that the material is resistant to scratching and wear.  For many engineering applications, including most of the tooling used in manufac- turing, scratch and wear resistance are important characteristics. As the reader shall  see later in this section, there is a strong correlation between hardness and strength.  

3.2.1  HARDNESS TESTS  

Hardness tests are commonly used for assessing material properties because they  are quick and convenient. However, a variety of testing methods are appropriate  because of differences in hardness among different materials. The best-known hard- ness tests are Brinell and Rockwell.  

Brinell Hardness Test  The Brinell hardness test is widely used for testing metals  and nonmetals of low- to medium hardness. It is named after the Swedish engineer  who developed it around 1900. In the test, a hardened steel (or cemented carbide)  ball of $10{\mathrm{-mm}}$  diameter is pressed into the surface of a specimen using a load of 500,  1500, or  $3000~\mathrm{kg}$ . The load is then divided into the indentation area to obtain the  Brinell Hardness Number (BHN). In equation form,  

$$
H B=\frac{2F}{\pi D_{b}(D_{b}-\sqrt{D_{b}^{2}-D_{i}^{2}})}
$$  

where  $H B\;=$ Brinell Hardness Number (BHN);  $F\,=$  indentation load, kg;  $D_{b}\,=$ diameter of the ball, mm; and $D_{i}=$  diameter of the indentation on the surface, mm.  

These dimensions are indicated in Figure 3.14(a). The resulting BHN has units  of $\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ , but the units are usually omitted in expressing the number. For harder  materials (above $500\:\mathrm{BHN}$ ), the cemented carbide ball is used because the steel ball  experiences elastic deformation that compromises the accuracy of the reading. Also,  higher loads (1500 and $3000\;\mathrm{kg}$ ) are typically used for harder materials. Because of  differences in results under different loads, it is considered good practice to indicate  the load used in the test when reporting $H B$  readings.  

Rockwell Hardness Test  This is another widely used test, named after the met- allurgist who developed it in the early 1920s. It is convenient to use, and several  enhancements over the years have made the test adaptable to a variety of materials.  

In the Rockwell Hardness Test, a cone-shaped indenter or small-diameter ball,  with diameter $=1.6$  or  $3.2~\mathrm{mm}$  (1/16 or 1/8 in) is pressed into the specimen using  a minor load of $10\,\mathrm{kg}$ , thus seating the indenter in the material. Then, a major load  of  $150~\mathrm{kg}$  (or other value) is applied, causing the indenter to penetrate into the

specimen a certain distance beyond its initial position. This additional penetration  distance  $d$  is converted into a Rockwell hardness reading by the testing machine.  The sequence is depicted in Figure 3.14(b). Differences in load and indenter ge- ometry provide various Rockwell scales for different materials. The most common  scales are indicated in Table 3.5.",/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt,"[ 0 . 8 3 8 8 6 8 8 0 3 0 9 6 7 0 8 6 ,   0 . 8 3 3 5 6 1 7 5 1 0 6 1 9 5 0 5 ,   0 . 8 3 3 4 8 8 9 9 0 3 2 0 7 2 6 2 ]",3.0,3.27

(b) Estimate the yield strength of the material.","Solution:  (b) Based on Table 3.2 in the text, the ratio of Y to TS for low carbon steel = 25,000/45,000 =0.555. Using this ratio, we can estimate the yield strength to be Y = 0.555(59,000) = 32,700 lb/in2.","To estimate the yield strength of the material from the Brinell Hardness Number (BHN), we can use an empirical relationship that is often used in materials science and engineering. This relationship provides a way to estimate the yield strength (\( \sigma_y \)) from the Brinell Hardness Number (\( HB \)):

\[
\sigma_y \approx \frac{HB}{3}
\]

This formula is a rough approximation and is typically used for steels and other metals where the relationship between hardness and yield strength is approximately linear.

Given:
- Brinell Hardness Number (\( HB \)) = 118

We can calculate the yield strength (\( \sigma_y \)) as follows:

\[
\sigma_y \approx \frac{118}{3} = 39.33 \text{ ksi}
\]

Therefore, the estimated yield strength of the annealed steel is approximately 39.33 ksi (kilo-pounds per square inch).

**Final Answer:**
The estimated yield strength of the material is approximately 39.33 ksi.","To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking .

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the  

! In machining, the  material is removed by the mechanism of shear deformation (Section 20.2).

"Two flat plates, separated by a space of 4 mm, are moving relative to each other at a velocity of 5 m/sec. The space between them is occupied by a fluid of unknown viscosity. The motion of the plates is resisted by a shear stress of 10 Pa due to the viscosity of the fluid. Assuming that the velocity gradient of the fluid is constant, determine the coefficient of viscosity of the fluid.",Solution: Shear rate = (5 m/s x 1000 mm/m)/(4 mm) = 1250 s-1 K = (10N/m2)/(1250 s-1) = 0.008 N-s/m2 = 0.008 Pa-s,"To determine the coefficient of viscosity of the fluid, we can use the relationship between shear stress, shear rate, and viscosity. The relevant equation is:

\[
\tau = \eta \dot{\gamma}
\]

where:
- \(\tau\) is the shear stress (10 Pa),
- \(\eta\) is the coefficient of viscosity (what we need to find),
- \(\dot{\gamma}\) is the shear rate.

The shear rate \(\dot{\gamma}\) is defined as the change in velocity \(d\nu\) relative to the change in distance \(dy\):

\[
\dot{\gamma} = \frac{d\nu}{dy}
\]

Given:
- The velocity difference \(d\nu = 5 \, \text{m/s}\),
- The distance between the plates \(dy = 4 \, \text{mm} = 0.004 \, \text{m}\).

First, calculate the shear rate:

\[
\dot{\gamma} = \frac{5 \, \text{m/s}}{0.004 \, \text{m}} = 1250 \, \text{s}^{-1}
\]

Now, substitute the values of \(\tau\) and \(\dot{\gamma}\) into the equation for shear stress:

\[
10 \, \text{Pa} = \eta \times 1250 \, \text{s}^{-1}
\]

Solve for \(\eta\):

\[
\eta = \frac{10 \, \text{Pa}}{1250 \, \text{s}^{-1}} = 0.008 \, \text{Pa}\cdot\text{s}
\]

Thus, the coefficient of viscosity of the fluid is \(0.008 \, \text{Pa}\cdot\text{s}\).","This force  can be reduced to a shear stress by dividing $F$  by the plate area $A$ :  

$$
\tau={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where  $\tau=$  shear stress,  $\mathbf{N}/\mathbf{m}^{2}\mathrm{or}$  Pa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ). This shear stress is related to the rate of  shear, which is deﬁ  ned as the change in velocity  $d\nu$  relative to $d y$ . That is,  

$$
\dot{\gamma}=\frac{d\nu}{d y}
$$  

where $\dot{\gamma}=$  shear rate, $1/\mathrm{s};d\nu=$  incremental change in velocity,  $\mathrm{m/s}$  (in/sec); and  $d y=$ incremental change in distance y, m (in). The shear viscosity is the ﬂ  uid property that  deﬁ  nes the relationship between $F/A$  and $d\nu/d y$ ; that is,  

$$
\frac{F}{A}=\eta\frac{d\nu}{d y}\quad\mathrm{or}\quad\tau=\eta\dot{\gamma}
$$  

where  $\eta\,=\,\mathrm{a}$  constant of proportionality called the coefﬁ  cient of viscosity, Pa-s  (lb-sec/in 2 ). Rearranging Equation (3.25), the coefﬁ  cient of viscosity can be ex- pressed as follows:  

$$
\eta=\frac{\tau}{\dot{\gamma}}
$$  

Thus, the viscosity of a ﬂ  uid can be deﬁ  ned as the ratio of shear stress to shear rate  during ﬂ  ow, where shear stress is the frictional force exerted by the ﬂ  uid per unit  area, and shear rate is the velocity gradient perpendicular to the ﬂ  ow direction. The  viscous characteristics of ﬂ  uids deﬁ  ned by Equation (3.26) were ﬁ  rst stated by New- ton. He observed that viscosity was a constant property of a given ﬂ  uid, and such a  ﬂ  uid is referred to as a  Newtonian ﬂ  uid .  

The units of coefﬁ  cient of viscosity require explanation. In the International Sys- tem of units (SI), because shear stress is expressed in  $\mathbf{N}/\mathbf{m}^{2}$  or Pascals and shear rate  in $1/\mathrm{s}$ , it follows that $\eta$  has units of $\mathrm{N}.\mathrm{s}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  or Pascal-seconds, abbreviated Pa-s. In the  U.S. customary units, the corresponding units are  $\mathrm{{lb/in^{2}}}$  and  $1/\mathrm{sec}$ , so that the units  for coefﬁ  cient of viscosity are lb-sec/in 2 . Other units sometimes given for viscosity  are poise, which  $=$  dyne-sec/cm 2  (10 poise  $=\,1$  Pa-s and  $\mathrm{6895~Pa-s}\,=\,1\ \mathrm{lb-sec/in^{2}}\$ ).

One can observe in several of the materials listed that viscosity varies with  temperature.  

Viscosity in Manufacturing Processes  For many metals, the viscosity in the  molten state compares with that of water at room temperature. Certain manufactur- ing processes, notably casting and welding, are performed on metals in their molten  state, and success in these operations requires low viscosity so that the molten metal  ﬁ  lls the mold cavity or weld seam before solidifying. This shear plane area can be calculated as  

$$
A_{s}=\frac{t_{o}w}{\sin\!\phi}
$$  

The shear stress in Equation (20.7) represents the level of stress required to per- form the machining operation. Therefore, this stress is equal to the shear strength of  the work material  $(\tau=S)$ ) under the conditions at which cutting occurs.  

Vector addition of the two force components  $F_{s}$  and  $F_{n}$  yields the resultant force  $R^{\prime}$ . In order for the forces acting on the chip to balance, this resultant  $R^{\prime}$  must be  equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and collinear with the resultant  $R$ .  

None of the four force components  $F,N,F_{s}$ , and $F_{n}$  can be directly measured  in a machining operation, because the directions in which they are applied vary  with different tool geometries and cutting conditions. However, it is possible  for the cutting tool to be instrumented using a force measuring device called a  dynamometer, so that two additional force components acting against the tool  can be directly measured: cutting force and thrust force. The  cutting force   $F_{c}$  is  in the direction of cutting, the same direction as the cutting speed  $\nu$ , and the  thrust force   $F_{t}$  is perpendicular to the cutting force and is associated with the  chip thickness before the cut $t_{o}$ . The cutting force and thrust force are shown in  Figure 20.10(b) together with their resultant force  $R^{\prime\prime}$ . The respective directions  of these forces are known, so the force transducers in the dynamometer can be  aligned accordingly.  

Equations can be derived to relate the four force components that cannot be meas- ured to the two forces that can be measured. Using the force diagram in Figure 20.11,  the following trigonometric relationships can be derived:  

If cutting force and thrust force are known, these four equations can be used to  calculate estimates of shear force, friction force, and normal force to friction. Based  on these force estimates, shear stress and coefﬁ  cient of friction can be determined.  

Note that in the special case of orthogonal cutting when the rake angle  $\alpha\,=\,0$ ,  Equations (20.9) and (20.10) reduce to  $\boldsymbol{F}=\boldsymbol{F}_{\iota}$  and $N=F_{c}$ , respectively. Thus, in this  special case, friction force and its normal force could be directly measured by the  dynamometer.  

# Example 20.2  Shear stress in  machining  

Suppose in Example 20.1 that cutting force and thrust force are measured dur- ing an orthogonal cutting operation: $F_{c}=1559\,\mathrm{N}$  and $F_{t}=1271$  N. The width  of the orthogonal cutting operation $w=3.0\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Based on these data, deter- mine the shear strength of the work material.  

Solution:  From Example 20.1, rake angle $\alpha=10^{\circ}$ , and shear plane angle $\phi=$ $25.4^{\circ}$ . Shear force can be computed from Equation (20.11):  

$$
F_{s}=1559\cos25.4-1271\sin25.4=863\:\mathrm{N}
$$  

The shear plane area is given by Equation (20.8):  

$$
A_{s}={\frac{(0.5)(3.0)}{\sin25.4}}=3.497\:\mathrm{mm}^{2}
$$  

Thus the shear stress, which equals the shear strength of the work material, is  

$$
\tau=S={\frac{863}{3.497}}=247\;\mathrm{N}/\mathrm{mm}^{2}=247\;\mathrm{MPa}
$$  

This example demonstrates that cutting force and thrust force are related to the  shear strength of the work material. The relationships can be established in a more  direct way. The densities of most molten metals are much higher than water and other ﬂ  uids  normally encountered. These molten metals are also much more chemically reac- tive than at room temperature. Consequently, the wear caused by the ﬂ  ow of these  metals in the mold is signiﬁ  cant, especially under turbulent conditions. Erosion is  especially serious when it occurs in the main cavity because the geometry of the  cast part is affected.  

# 10.2.3  ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF POURING  

There are several relationships that govern the ﬂ  ow of liquid metal through  the gating system and into the mold. An important relationship is  Bernoulli’s  theorem , which states that the sum of the energies (head, pressure, kinetic, and  friction) at any two points in a ﬂ  owing liquid are equal. This can be written in the  following form:  

$$
h_{1}+\frac{p_{1}}{\rho}+\frac{\nu_{1}^{2}}{2g}+F_{1}=h_{2}+\frac{p^{2}}{\rho}+\frac{\nu_{2}^{2}}{2g}+F_{2}
$$  

where $h=$  head, cm (in), $p=$  pressure on the liquid, $\mathrm{N}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}\,(\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{in}^{2});\rho=\mathrm{density},\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ $\mathrm{(l bm/in}^{3})$ ;  $\nu~=$  ﬂ  ow velocity, cm/s (in/sec);  $g\,=$ gravitational acceleration constant,  $981\;\mathrm{cm/s/s}$ $\mathrm{s/s}\;(32.2\times12=386\;\mathrm{in/sec/sec})$ ; and $F=$  head losses due to friction, cm (in).  Subscripts 1 and 2 indicate any two locations in the liquid ﬂ  ow.  

Bernoulli’s equation can be simpliﬁ  ed in several ways. If friction losses are ignored  (to be sure, friction will affect the liquid ﬂ  ow through a sand mold), and the system  is assumed to remain at atmospheric pressure throughout, then the equation can be  reduced to  

$$
h_{1}+\frac{\nu_{1}^{2}}{2g}=h_{2}+\frac{\nu_{2}^{2}}{2g}
$$  

This can be used to determine the velocity of the molten metal at the base of the  sprue. Let point 1 be deﬁ  ned at the top of the sprue and point 2 at its base. If point  2 is used as the reference plane, then the head at that point is zero ( $(h_{2}=0)$ ) and  $h_{1}$   is the height (length) of the sprue. When the metal is poured into the pouring cup  and overﬂ  ows down the sprue, its initial velocity at the top is zero ( $\left(\nu_{1}=0\right)$ ). Hence,  Equation (10.3) further simpliﬁ  es to  

$$
h_{1}=\frac{\nu_{2}^{2}}{2g}
$$  

which can be solved for the ﬂ  ow velocity:  

$$
\nu=\sqrt{2g h}
$$  

where  $\nu\,=$  the velocity of the liquid metal at the base of the sprue, $\mathrm{{cm}/\mathrm{{s}}}$  (in/sec);  $g=981\ \mathrm{cm/s/s}\ (386\ \mathrm{in/sec/sec});$ ; and $h=$  the height of the sprue, cm (in).  

Another relationship of importance during pouring is the  continuity law , which  states that the volume rate of ﬂ  ow remains constant throughout the liquid. The vol- ume ﬂ  ow rate is equal to the velocity multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the  ﬂ  owing liquid.",/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec20.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec10.txt,"[ 0 . 8 8 2 6 8 3 1 3 7 9 6 5 9 8 1 1 ,   0 . 8 2 8 8 9 7 2 3 4 6 0 3 0 7 7 2 ,   0 . 8 2 8 7 6 1 2 4 9 9 0 2 9 7 4 7 ]",3.0,3.28
"Two parallel surfaces, separated by a space of 0.5 in that is occupied by a fluid, are moving relative to each other at a velocity of 25 in/sec. The motion is resisted by a shear stress of 0.3 lb/in2 due to the viscosity of the fluid. If the velocity gradient in the space between the surfaces is constant, determine the viscosity of the fluid.",Solution: Shear rate = (25 in/sec)/(0.5 in) = 50 sec-1 K = (0.3 lb/in2)/(50 sec-1) = 0.0006 lb-sec/in2.,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the viscosity of the fluid using the given information. The relationship between shear stress, shear rate, and viscosity is given by:

\[
\tau = \eta \dot{\gamma}
\]

where:
- \(\tau\) is the shear stress,
- \(\eta\) is the viscosity,
- \(\dot{\gamma}\) is the shear rate.

### Step 1: Identify the Given Values

From the problem statement, we have:
- Shear stress, \(\tau = 0.3 \, \text{lb/in}^2\),
- Velocity of the surfaces, \(d\nu = 25 \, \text{in/sec}\),
- Distance between the surfaces, \(dy = 0.5 \, \text{in}\).

### Step 2: Calculate the Shear Rate

The shear rate \(\dot{\gamma}\) is defined as the change in velocity per unit distance:

\[
\dot{\gamma} = \frac{d\nu}{dy}
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
\dot{\gamma} = \frac{25 \, \text{in/sec}}{0.5 \, \text{in}} = 50 \, \text{sec}^{-1}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Viscosity

Using the relationship \(\tau = \eta \dot{\gamma}\), we can solve for the viscosity \(\eta\):

\[
\eta = \frac{\tau}{\dot{\gamma}}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\eta = \frac{0.3 \, \text{lb/in}^2}{50 \, \text{sec}^{-1}} = 0.006 \, \text{lb-sec/in}^2
\]

### Final Answer

The viscosity of the fluid is \(0.006 \, \text{lb-sec/in}^2\).","This force  can be reduced to a shear stress by dividing $F$  by the plate area $A$ :  

$$
\tau={\frac{F}{A}}

where  $\tau=$  shear stress,  $\mathbf{N}/\mathbf{m}^{2}\mathrm{or}$  Pa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ). This shear stress is related to the rate of  shear, which is deﬁ  ned as the change in velocity  $d\nu$  relative to $d y$ . That is,  

$$
\dot{\gamma}=\frac{d\nu}{d y}
$$  

where $\dot{\gamma}=$  shear rate, $1/\mathrm{s};d\nu=$  incremental change in velocity,  $\mathrm{m/s}$  (in/sec); and  $d y=$ incremental change in distance y, m (in). The shear viscosity is the ﬂ  uid property that  deﬁ  nes the relationship between $F/A$  and $d\nu/d y$ ; that is,  

$$
\frac{F}{A}=\eta\frac{d\nu}{d y}\quad\mathrm{or}\quad\tau=\eta\dot{\gamma}
$$  

where  $\eta\,=\,\mathrm{a}$  constant of proportionality called the coefﬁ  cient of viscosity, Pa-s  (lb-sec/in 2 ). Rearranging Equation (3.25), the coefﬁ  cient of viscosity can be ex- pressed as follows:  

$$
\eta=\frac{\tau}{\dot{\gamma}}
$$  

Thus, the viscosity of a ﬂ  uid can be deﬁ  ned as the ratio of shear stress to shear rate  during ﬂ  ow, where shear stress is the frictional force exerted by the ﬂ  uid per unit  area, and shear rate is the velocity gradient perpendicular to the ﬂ  ow direction.

Thus, in this  special case, friction force and its normal force could be directly measured by the  dynamometer.  

# Example 20.2  Shear stress in  machining  

Suppose in Example 20.1 that cutting force and thrust force are measured dur- ing an orthogonal cutting operation: $F_{c}=1559\,\mathrm{N}$  and $F_{t}=1271$  N. The width  of the orthogonal cutting operation $w=3.0\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Based on these data, deter- mine the shear strength of the work material.  

Solution:  From Example 20.1, rake angle $\alpha=10^{\circ}$ , and shear plane angle $\phi=$ $25.4^{\circ}$ . Shear force can be computed from Equation (20.11):  

$$
F_{s}=1559\cos25.4-1271\sin25.4=863\:\mathrm{N}
$$  

The shear plane area is given by Equation (20.8):  

$$
A_{s}={\frac{(0.5)(3.0)}{\sin25.4}}=3.497\:\mathrm{mm}^{2}
$$  

Thus the shear stress, which equals the shear strength of the work material, is  

$$
\tau=S={\frac{863}{3.497}}=247\;\mathrm{N}/\mathrm{mm}^{2}=247\;\mathrm{MPa}
$$  

This example demonstrates that cutting force and thrust force are related to the  shear strength of the work material. The relationships can be established in a more  direct way. Shear force can be computed from Equation (20.11):  

$$

This example demonstrates that cutting force and thrust force are related to the  shear strength of the work material. The relationships can be established in a more  direct way. Recalling from Equation (20.7) that the shear force  $F_{s}=S\,A_{s}$ , the force  diagram of Figure 20.11 can be used to derive the following equations:  

$$
F_{c}=\frac{S t_{o}w\mathrm{cos}(\beta-\alpha)}{\mathrm{sin}\,\phi\,\mathrm{cos}(\phi+\beta-\alpha)}=\frac{F_{s}\,\mathrm{cos}(\beta-\alpha)}{\mathrm{cos}(\phi+\beta-\alpha)}

# 20.3.2  THE MERCHANT EQUATION  

One of the important relationships in metal cutting was derived by Eugene Mer- chant [10]. Its derivation was based on the assumption of orthogonal cutting, but  its general validity extends to three-dimensional machining operations. Merchant  started with the deﬁ  nition of shear stress expressed in the form of the following rela- tionship derived by combining Equations (20.7), (20.8), and (20.11):  

$$
\tau=\frac{F_{c}\cos\phi-F_{t}\sin\phi}{\left(t_{o}\,w/\mathrm{sin}\,\phi\right)}
$$  

Merchant reasoned that, out of all the possible angles emanating from the cut- ting edge of the tool at which shear deformation could occur, there is one angle  $\phi$   that predominates. This is the angle at which shear stress is just equal to the shear  strength of the work material, and so shear deformation occurs at this angle. For all  other possible shear angles, the shear stress is less than the shear strength, so chip  formation cannot occur at these other angles. In effect, the work material will select a  shear plane angle that minimizes energy. This angle can be determined by taking the  derivative of the shear stress  $\tau$  in Equation (20.15) with respect to $\phi$  and setting the  derivative to zero. Solving for $\phi$ , the relationship named after Merchant is obtained:  

$$
\phi=45+\frac{\alpha}{2}-\frac{\beta}{2}
$$  

Among the assumptions in the Merchant equation is that shear strength of  the work material is a constant, unaffected by strain rate, temperature, and other  factors. Because this assumption is violated in practical machining operations,  Equation (20.16) must be considered an approximate relationship rather than an  accurate mathematical equation. Nevertheless, consider its application in the fol- lowing example.

In the clearance between the shaft and the bushing is a lubricating oil whose viscosity = 0.14 Pa-s. The shaft rotates at a velocity of 400 rev/min; this speed and the action of the oil are sufficient to keep the shaft centered inside the bushing. Determine the magnitude of the torque due to viscosity that acts to resist the rotation of the shaft.,Solution: Bushing internal bearing area A = (125.6)^2 x 50/4 = 19729.6 mm2 = 19729.2(10^-6) m2 d = (125.6 -125)/2 = 0.3 mm v = (125pi mm/rev)(400 rev/min)(1 min/60 sec) = 2618.0 mm/s Shear rate = 2618/0.3 = 8726.6 s-1     W = (0.14)(8726.6) = 1221.7 Pa = 1221.7 N/mm2 Force on surface between shaft and bushing = (1221.7 N/mm2)(19729.2(10^-6)) = 24.1 N Torque T = 24.1 N x 125/2 mm = 1506.4 N-mm = 1.506 N-m,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the torque due to the viscosity of the lubricating oil that resists the rotation of the shaft. This is a classic problem of viscous drag in a cylindrical geometry, where the shaft rotates inside a stationary bushing with a thin layer of lubricant in between.

### Given Data:
- Diameter of the shaft, \( D_s = 125.0 \, \text{mm} = 0.125 \, \text{m} \)
- Inside diameter of the bushing, \( D_b = 125.6 \, \text{mm} = 0.1256 \, \text{m} \)
- Length of the bushing, \( L = 50.0 \, \text{mm} = 0.050 \, \text{m} \)
- Viscosity of the oil, \( \mu = 0.14 \, \text{Pa}\cdot\text{s} \)
- Rotational speed of the shaft, \( N = 400 \, \text{rev/min} \)

### Calculations:

1. **Calculate the clearance (gap) between the shaft and the bushing:**
   \[
   c = \frac{D_b - D_s}{2} = \frac{0.1256 \, \text{m} - 0.1250 \, \text{m}}{2} = 0.0003 \, \text{m}
   \]

2. **Convert the rotational speed to radians per second:**
   \[
   \omega = 2\pi \times \frac{N}{60} = 2\pi \times \frac{400}{60} \approx 41.89 \, \text{rad/s}
   \]

3. **Calculate the torque due to viscosity:**

   The torque \( T \) due to viscous drag in a cylindrical geometry can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   T = \frac{\pi \mu L \omega D_s^3}{2c}
   \]

   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   T = \frac{\pi \times 0.14 \, \text{Pa}\cdot\text{s} \times 0.050 \, \text{m} \times 41.89 \, \text{rad/s} \times (0.125 \, \text{m})^3}{2 \times 0.0003 \, \text{m}}
   \]

   \[
   T = \frac{\pi \times 0.14 \times 0.050 \times 41.89 \times 0.001953125}{0.0006}
   \]

   \[
   T = \frac{0.000558 \times 41.89}{0.0006}
   \]

   \[
   T = \frac{0.02338}{0.0006} \approx 38.97 \, \text{Nm}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The magnitude of the torque due to viscosity that acts to resist the rotation of the shaft is approximately \( 38.97 \, \text{Nm} \).","The motor shaft drives the leadscrew that determines the position and veloc- ity of the worktable. The connection is often designed using a gear reduction to  increase the precision of table movement. However, the angle of rotation and  rotational speed of the leadscrew are reduced by this gear ratio. The relationships  are as follows:  

$$
A_{m}=r_{g}A_{l s}
$$  

and  

$$
N_{m}=r_{g}N_{l s}
$$  

where $A_{m}$  and $N_{m}$  are the angle of rotation, degrees, and rotational speed, rev/min, of  the motor, respectively; $A_{l s}$  and $N_{l s}$  are the angle of rotation, degrees, and rotational  speed, $\mathrm{rev/min}$ , of the leadscrew, respectively; and  $r_{g}=$  gear reduction between the  motor shaft and the leadscrew; for example, a gear reduction of 2 means that the mo- tor shaft rotates through two revolutions for each rotation of the leadscrew.  

The linear position of the table in response to the rotation of the leadscrew de- pends on the leadscrew pitch $p$ , and can be determined as follows:  

$$
x=\frac{p A_{l s}}{360}
$$  

where $x=x$ -axis position relative to the starting position, ${\mathrm{mm~(in)}};p=$ pitch of the  leadscrew, mm/rev (in/rev); and $A_{l s}/360\,=$  the number of revolutions (and partial  revolutions) of the leadscrew. By combining Equations (37.5), (37.7a), and (37.8)  and rearranging, the number of pulses required to achieve a speciﬁ  ed  $x$ -position  increment in a point-to-point system can be found:  

$$
n_{p}=\frac{360r_{g}x}{p\alpha}{=}\frac{r_{g}n_{s}A_{l s}}{360}
$$  

The velocity of the worktable in the direction of the leadscrew axis can be deter- mined as follows:  

$$
\nu_{t}=f_{r}=N_{l s}\,p
$$  

where  $\nu_{t}=$  table travel speed, $\mathrm{mm/min}\ (\mathrm{in/min});f_{r}=$ table feed rate,  $\mathrm{mm/min}$   $\mathrm{(in/}$ min);  $N_{l s}\,=$  rotational speed of the leadscrew, rev/min; and  $p\ =$ leadscrew pitch,  mm/rev (in/rev). The rotational speed of the leadscrew depends on the frequency of  pulses driving the stepping motor:  

$$
N_{l s}=\frac{60f_{p}}{n_{s}r_{g}}
$$  

where  $N_{l s}=$  leadscrew rotational speed, rev/min;  $f_{p}\,=$  pulse train frequency,  $\mathrm{Hz}$ (pulses/sec); $n_{s}=$  steps/rev, or pulses/rev, and $r_{g}=$  gear reduction between the mo- tor and the leadscrew. For a two-axis table with continuous path control, the rela- tive velocities of the axes are coordinated to achieve the desired travel direction.  Finally, the required pulse frequency to drive the table at a speciﬁ  ed feed rate can  be obtained by combining Equations (37.10) and (37.11) and rearranging to solve  for $f_{p}$ :  

$$
f_{p}=\frac{\nu_{t}n_{s}r_{g}}{60p}\!=\frac{f_{r}n_{s}r_{g}}{60p}=\frac{N_{l s}n_{s}r_{g}}{60}=\frac{N_{m}n_{s}}{60}
$$

A stepping motor has 48 step angles. Its output shaft is coupled to a leadscrew  with a 4:1 gear reduction (four turns of the motor shaft for each turn of the  leadscrew). The leadscrew pitch $=5.0\:\mathrm{mm}$ . The high-speed rotation results in centrifugal forces that cause  the metal to take the shape of the mold cavity. Thus, the outside shape of the cast- ing can be round, octagonal, hexagonal, and so on. However, the inside shape of  the casting is (theoretically) perfectly round, due to the radially symmetric forces  at work.  

Orientation of the axis of mold rotation can be either horizontal or vertical, the  former being more common. The question is, how fast must the mold be rotated

for the process to work successfully? Consider  horizontal centrifugal casting  ﬁ  rst.  Centrifugal force is deﬁ  ned by this physics equation:  

$$
F=\frac{m\nu^{2}}{R}
$$  

where  $F=$  force, $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); $m=$ mass, kg (lbm);  $\nu=$  velocity,  $\mathrm{m/s}$  (ft/sec); and  $R={\mathrm{in}}.$ - side radius of the mold,  $\mathrm{m}$  (ft). The force of gravity is its weight  $W=m g$ , where  $W$  is  given in $\mathrm{kg}$  (lb), and $g=$  acceleration of gravity, $9.8\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}^{2}$  (32.2 ft/sec 2 ). The so-called  G-factor  $G F$  is the ratio of centrifugal force divided by weight:  

$$
G F=\frac{F}{W}=\frac{m\nu^{2}}{R m g}=\frac{\nu^{2}}{R g}
$$  

Velocity $\nu$  can be expressed as $2\pi R N/60=\pi R N/30$ , where the constant 60 converts  seconds to minutes; so that $N=$  rotational speed, rev/min. Substituting this expres- sion into Equation (11.3),  

$$
G F=\frac{\displaystyle{\bigg(\frac{\pi R N}{30}\bigg)^{2}}}{R g}=\frac{R\bigg(\displaystyle{\frac{\pi N}{30}\bigg)^{2}}}{g}
$$  

Rearranging this to solve for rotational speed  $N$ , and using diameter  $D$  rather than  radius in the resulting equation,  

$$
N=\frac{30}{\pi}\sqrt{\frac{g G F}{R}}=\frac{30}{\pi}\sqrt{\frac{2g G F}{D}}
$$  

where  $D=$  inside diameter of the mold,  $\mathrm{m}$  (ft). If the  $\mathrm{G}$ -factor is too low in cen- trifugal casting, the liquid metal will not remain forced against the mold wall during  the upper half of the circular path but will “rain” inside the cavity. Slipping occurs  between the molten metal and the mold wall, which means that the rotational speed  of the metal is less than that of the mold. On an empirical basis, values of  $G F=60$   to 80 are found to be appropriate for horizontal centrifugal casting [2], although this  depends to some extent on the metal being cast.  

A true centrifugal casting operation is to be performed horizontally to make  copper tube sections with  $O D=25\,\mathrm{{cm}}$  and  $I D=22.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ . What rotational  speed is required if a G-factor of 65 is used to cast the tubing? Solution:  The inside diameter of the mold  $D=O D$  of the casting  $=25\,\mathrm{cm}=$ $0.25\:\mathrm{m}$ . The required rotational speed can be computed from Equation (11.5)  as follows:  

$$
N={\frac{30}{\pi}}{\sqrt{\frac{2(9.8)(65)}{0.25}}}=681.7\;\mathrm{rev/min}
$$  

In  vertical centrifugal casting , the effect of gravity acting on the liquid metal  causes the casting wall to be thicker at the base than at the top. What rotational  speed is required if a G-factor of 65 is used to cast the tubing? Solution:  The inside diameter of the mold  $D=O D$  of the casting  $=25\,\mathrm{cm}=$ $0.25\:\mathrm{m}$ . The required rotational speed can be computed from Equation (11.5)  as follows:  

$$
N={\frac{30}{\pi}}{\sqrt{\frac{2(9.8)(65)}{0.25}}}=681.7\;\mathrm{rev/min}
$$  

In  vertical centrifugal casting , the effect of gravity acting on the liquid metal  causes the casting wall to be thicker at the base than at the top. The inside proﬁ  le of  the casting wall takes on a parabolic shape. The difference in inside radius between  top and bottom is related to speed of rotation as follows:  

$$
N=\frac{30}{\pi}\sqrt{\frac{2g L}{R_{t}^{2}-R_{b}^{2}}}
$$  

where  $L=$  vertical length of the casting, m (ft);  $R_{t}=$  inside radius at the top of  the casting, m (ft); and  $R_{b}\,=$  inside radius at the bottom of the casting, m (ft).  Equation (11.6) can be used to determine the required rotational speed for verti- cal centrifugal casting, given speciﬁ  cations on the inside radii at top and bottom.  One can see from the formula that for  $R_{t}$  to equal  $R_{b}$ , the speed of rotation  $N$   would have to be inﬁ  nite, which is impossible of course. As a practical matter, part  lengths made by vertical centrifugal casting are usually no more than about twice  their diameters. This is quite satisfactory for bushings and other parts that have  large diameters relatively to their lengths, especially if machining will be used to  accurately size the inside diameter.  

Castings made by true centrifugal casting are characterized by high density, espe- cially in the outer regions of the part where $F$  is greatest. Solidiﬁ  cation shrinkage at  the exterior of the cast tube is not a factor, because the centrifugal force continually  reallocates molten metal toward the mold wall during freezing. Any impurities in the  casting tend to be on the inner wall and can be removed by machining if necessary.  

Semicentrifugal Casting   In this method, centrifugal force is used to produce  solid castings, as in Figure 11.18, rather than tubular parts. The rotation speed in  semicentrifugal casting is usually set so that G-factors of around 15 are obtained [2],  and the molds are designed with risers at the center to supply feed metal. Density of  metal in the ﬁ  nal casting is greater in the outer sections than at the center of rota- tion. The process is often used on parts in which the center of the casting is machined  away, thus eliminating the portion of the casting where the quality is lowest. Wheels  and pulleys are examples of castings that can be made by this process. Expendable  molds are often used in semicentrifugal casting, as suggested by the illustration of  the process.

Centrifuge Casting   In centrifuge casting, Figure 11.19, the mold is designed with  part cavities located away from the axis of rotation, so that the molten metal poured  into the mold is distributed to these cavities by centrifugal force. The process is used  for smaller parts, and radial symmetry of the part is not a requirement as it is for the  other two centrifugal casting methods.",/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec37.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec11.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec11.txt,"[ 0 . 8 3 1 0 6 7 2 5 8 3 8 6 7 3 ,   0 . 8 2 6 3 2 3 9 2 0 8 7 4 2 4 1 8 ,   0 . 8 2 0 8 3 5 2 5 9 0 5 9 4 3 3 4 ]",3.0,3.3
"The starting diameter of a shaft is 25.00 mm. This shaft is to be inserted into a hole in an expansion fit assembly operation. To be readily inserted, the shaft must be reduced in diameter by cooling. Determine the temperature to which the shaft must be reduced from room temperature (20C) in order to reduce its diameter to 24.98 mm. Refer to Table 4.1.","Solution: For steel, a = 12(10^-6) mm/mm/C according to Table 4.1. Revise Eq. (4.1) to D2-D1= aD1(T2-T1). 24.98 -25.00 = 12(10^-6)(25.00)(T2 -20) -0.02 = 300(10^-6)(T2 -20) -0.02 = 0.0003(T2 -20) = 0.0003T2 -0.006 -.02 + 0.006 = 0.0003T2 -0.014 = 0.0003T2                             T2= -46.67C","To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature to which the shaft must be cooled to achieve the desired reduction in diameter. We will use the formula for thermal expansion/contraction:

\[
D_{2} - D_{1} = \alpha \cdot D_{1} \cdot (T_{2} - T_{1})
\]

Where:
- \( D_{2} \) is the final diameter of the shaft after cooling.
- \( D_{1} \) is the initial diameter of the shaft.
- \( \alpha \) is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion for the material.
- \( T_{2} \) is the final temperature of the shaft.
- \( T_{1} \) is the initial temperature of the shaft.

Given:
- \( D_{1} = 25.00 \, \text{mm} \)
- \( D_{2} = 24.98 \, \text{mm} \)
- \( T_{1} = 20^\circ \text{C} \)

From the provided information, the coefficient of thermal expansion for steel is \( \alpha = 12 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{mm/mm} \cdot ^\circ \text{C} \).

We need to rearrange the formula to solve for \( T_{2} \):

\[
T_{2} = \frac{(D_{2} - D_{1})}{\alpha \cdot D_{1}} + T_{1}
\]

Substitute the given values into the equation:

\[
T_{2} = \frac{(24.98 - 25.00)}{12 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 25.00} + 20
\]

Calculate the change in diameter:

\[
D_{2} - D_{1} = 24.98 - 25.00 = -0.02 \, \text{mm}
\]

Now, substitute this value into the equation:

\[
T_{2} = \frac{-0.02}{12 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 25.00} + 20
\]

Calculate the fraction:

\[
T_{2} = \frac{-0.02}{0.0003} + 20
\]

\[
T_{2} = -66.67 + 20
\]

\[
T_{2} = -46.67^\circ \text{C}
\]

Therefore, the shaft must be cooled to approximately \(-46.67^\circ \text{C}\) to achieve the desired reduction in diameter for the expansion fit assembly.","These assembly methods are used to ﬁ  t gears, pulleys, sleeves,  and other components onto solid and hollow shafts.  

Various methods are used to heat and/or cool the work parts. Heating equip- ment includes torches, furnaces, electric resistance heaters, and electric induction  heaters. Cooling methods include conventional refrigeration, packing in dry ice,  and immersion in cold liquids, including liquid nitrogen. The resulting change in  diameter depends on the coefﬁ  cient of thermal expansion and the temperature  difference that is applied to the part. If it is assumed that the heating or cooling  has produced a uniform temperature throughout the work, then the change in di- ameter is given by  

$$
D_{2}\!-\!D_{1}=\alpha\,D_{1}(T_{2}\!-\!T_{1})
$$  

where $\alpha=$  the coefﬁ  cient of linear thermal expansion, $\mathrm{mm/mm\cdot^{\circ}C}$  (in/in- $\mathrm{\cdot^{\circ}F}$ ) for the  material (see Table 4.1);  $T_{2}=$  the temperature to which the parts have been heated  or cooled, $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $\mathrm{(^{\circ}F)}$ ;  $T_{1}=$  starting ambient temperature;  $D_{2}=$  diameter of the part at  $T_{2},\mathrm{mm}$ $D_{\scriptscriptstyle1}=$  diameter of the part at  $T_{1}$ .  

Equations (31.5) through (31.9) for computing interference pressures and  effective stresses can be used to determine the corresponding values for shrink and  expansion ﬁ  ts.  

# Example 31.2  Expansion ﬁ  t  

An alloy steel shaft is to be inserted into a collar of the same metal using an  expansion ﬁ  t. At room temperature  $(20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ , the outer and inner diameters  of the collar $=50.00\:\mathrm{mm}$  and  $30.00\:\mathrm{mm}$ , respectively, and the shaft has a  diameter  $=30.015\:\mathrm{mm}$ . The shaft must be reduced in size for assembly into  the collar by cooling to a sufﬁ  ciently low temperature that there is a  clearance of  $0.03\;\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) the temperature to which the shaft  must be cooled for assembly, (b) the radial pressure at room temperature  after assembly, and (c) the maximum effective stress on the collar.  

![](images/bbe61de318dda8ada1f64a1a5c30123dcf79321f159c203332299663be67ef5e.jpg)  

Solution:  (a) From Table 4.1, the coefﬁ  cient of thermal expansion for steel  $\alpha=12(10^{-6})\mathrm{\,^{\circ}C^{-1}}$ . Rearranging Equation 31.10 to solve for the cooling  temperature,  

$$
T_{2}={\frac{(D2-D_{1})}{\alpha\,D_{1}}}+\,T_{1}={\frac{(30.00-0.03)-30.015}{12(10^{-6})(30.015)}}+20=-124.9+20=-104.9^{\circ}{\bf C}
$$  

(b) From Table 3.1, the modulus of elasticity for steel  $E=209(10^{3})$  MPa. The maximum effective stress occurs in the collar at its inside diameter and can  be calculated as  

$$
\mathrm{Max}\,\sigma_{e}=\frac{2p_{f}D_{c}^{2}}{D_{c}^{2}\!-\!D_{p}^{2}}
$$  

where Max  $\sigma_{e}=$  the maximum effective stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ), and  $p_{f}$ is the interfer- ence ﬁ  t pressure computed from Equation (31.5).  

In situations in which a straight pin or shaft is pressed into the hole of a large part  with geometry other than that of a collar, the previous equations can be simpliﬁ  ed by  taking the outside diameter $D_{c}$  to be inﬁ  nite, thus reducing the equation for interfer- ence pressure to  

$$
p_{f}={\frac{E i}{D_{p}}}
$$  

and the corresponding maximum effective stress becomes  

$$
\operatorname{Max}\sigma_{e}=2p_{f}
$$  

In most cases, particularly for ductile metals, the maximum effective stress should  be compared with the yield strength of the material, applying an appropriate safety  factor, as in the following:  

$$
\operatorname*{Max}\sigma_{e}\leq\frac{Y}{S F}
$$  

where  $Y=$  yield strength of the material, and $S F$  is the applicable safety factor.  

Various pin geometries are available for interference ﬁ  ts. The basic type is a  straight pin , usually made from cold-drawn carbon steel wire or bar stock, ranging  in diameter from 1.6 to $25\,\mathrm{mm}$  (1/16–1.0 in). They are unground, with chamfered or  square ends (chamfered ends facilitate press ﬁ  tting).  Dowel pins  are manufactured  to more precise speciﬁ  cations than straight pins, and can be ground and hardened.  They are used to ﬁ  x the alignment of assembled components in dies, ﬁ  xtures, and  machinery.  Taper pins  possess a taper of  $6.4~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.25 in) per foot and are driven  into the hole to establish a ﬁ  xed relative position between the parts. Their advantage  is that they can be driven readily back out of the hole.  

Additional pin geometries are commercially available, including  grooved pins — solid straight pins with three longitudinal grooves in which the metal is raised on  either side of each groove to cause interference when the pin is pressed into a hole;  knurled pins , pins with a knurled pattern that causes interference in the mating hole;  and  coiled pins , also called  spiral pins , which are made by rolling strip stock into a  coiled spring.  

Shrink and Expansion Fits   These terms refer to the assembly of two parts that  have an interference ﬁ  t at room temperature. The typical case is a cylindrical pin  or shaft assembled into a collar. To assemble by  shrink ﬁ  tting , the external part is  heated to enlarge it by thermal expansion, and the internal part either remains at  room temperature or is cooled to contract its size. The parts are then assembled and  brought back to room temperature, so that the external part shrinks, and if previous- ly cooled the internal part expands, to form a strong interference ﬁ  t. An  expansion  $\mathbf{\nabla}f t$  is when only the internal part is cooled to contract it for assembly; once inserted  into the mating component, it warms to room temperature, expanding to create the  interference assembly. These assembly methods are used to ﬁ  t gears, pulleys, sleeves,  and other components onto solid and hollow shafts.  

Various methods are used to heat and/or cool the work parts. Heating equip- ment includes torches, furnaces, electric resistance heaters, and electric induction  heaters. Cooling methods include conventional refrigeration, packing in dry ice,  and immersion in cold liquids, including liquid nitrogen. The resulting change in  diameter depends on the coefﬁ  cient of thermal expansion and the temperature  difference that is applied to the part. Rearranging Equation 31.10 to solve for the cooling  temperature,  

$$
T_{2}={\frac{(D2-D_{1})}{\alpha\,D_{1}}}+\,T_{1}={\frac{(30.00-0.03)-30.015}{12(10^{-6})(30.015)}}+20=-124.9+20=-104.9^{\circ}{\bf C}
$$  

(b) From Table 3.1, the modulus of elasticity for steel  $E=209(10^{3})$  MPa. Using Equation (31.5) to solve for radial pressure, where  $D_{c}=50.00\,\mathrm{mm}$  and  $D_{p}=30.025\:\mathrm{mm}$  

$$
P_{f}={\frac{E i(D_{c}^{2}-D_{p}^{2})}{D_{p}D_{c}^{2}}}={\frac{209(10^{3})(0.015)(50^{2}-30.015^{2})}{30.015(50^{2})}}=66.8\ \mathrm{MPa}
$$  

(c) The maximum effective stress is given by Equation 31.8:  

$$
\mathbf{Max}\:\sigma_{e}={\frac{2p_{f}D_{c}^{2}}{D_{c}^{2}\!-\!D_{p}^{2}}}={\frac{2(66.8)(50^{2})}{(50^{2}\!-\!30.015^{2})}}={\mathbf{209}}\:\mathbf{MHz}
$$  

Snap Fits and Retaining Rings   Snap ﬁ  ts are a variation of interference ﬁ  ts. A  snap ﬁ  t  involves joining two parts in which the mating elements possess a tempo- rary interference while being pressed together, but once assembled they interlock  to maintain the assembly. A typical example is shown in Figure 31.13: as the parts  are pressed together, the mating elements elastically deform to accommodate the  interference, subsequently allowing the parts to snap together; once in position,  the elements become connected mechanically so that they cannot easily be disas- sembled. The parts are usually designed so that a slight interference exists after  assembly.  

Advantages of snap ﬁ  t assembly include (1) the parts can be designed with self- aligning features, (2) no special tooling is required, and (3) assembly can be accom- plished very quickly. Snap ﬁ  tting was originally conceived as a method that would  be ideally suited to industrial robotics applications; however, it is no surprise that  assembly techniques that are easier for robots are also easier for human assembly  workers.

FIGURE 31.14  Retaining ring assem- bled into a groove on a  shaft.  

A  retaining ring , also known as a  snap ring , is a fastener that snaps into a circum- ferential groove on a shaft or tube to form a shoulder, as in Figure 31.14. The assembly  can be used to locate or restrict the movement of parts mounted on the shaft. Retain- ing rings are available for both external (shaft) and internal (bore) applications. They  are made from either sheet metal or wire stock, heat treated for hardness and stiff- ness. To assemble a retaining ring, a special pliers tool is used to elastically deform the  ring so that it ﬁ  ts over the shaft (or into the bore) and then is released into the groove.  

#  Other Mechanical Fastening Methods  

In addition to the mechanical assembly techniques discussed above, there are sev- eral additional methods that involve the use of fasteners. These include stitching,  stapling, sewing, and cotter pins.",/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec31.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec31.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec31.txt,"[ 0 . 8 7 6 9 1 0 7 3 5 9 1 8 0 3 1 1 ,   0 . 8 3 6 5 0 5 9 4 9 7 2 4 4 2 7 9 ,   0 . 8 2 7 9 3 5 2 2 6 8 9 6 9 6 2 4 ]",4.0,4.1
"Aluminum has a density of 2.70 g/cm3 at room temperature (20C). Determine its density at 650C, using data in Table 4.1 as a reference.","Solution: Assume a 1 cm3 cube, 1 cm on each side. From Table 4.1, a = 24(10^-6) mm/mm/C L2-L1=a L1(T2-T2). L2 = 1.0 + 24(10^-6)(1.0)(650 -20) = 1.01512 cm (L2 )^3 = (1.01512)^3 = 1.04605 cm3 Assume weight remains the same; thus U at 650C = 2.70/1.04605 = 2.581 g/cm3","To determine the density of aluminum at 650°C, we need to account for the thermal expansion of the material as it is heated from room temperature (20°C) to 650°C. The density of a material changes with temperature due to thermal expansion, which affects the volume of the material.

The formula to calculate the change in density due to thermal expansion is:

\[
\rho_T = \frac{\rho_0}{1 + \beta \Delta T}
\]

Where:
- \(\rho_T\) is the density at the elevated temperature \(T\).
- \(\rho_0\) is the initial density at room temperature.
- \(\beta\) is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion.
- \(\Delta T\) is the change in temperature.

From the problem statement, we know:
- \(\rho_0 = 2.70 \, \text{g/cm}^3\) (density at 20°C).
- \(\Delta T = 650°C - 20°C = 630°C\).

We need the coefficient of linear thermal expansion (\(\beta\)) for aluminum. This value is typically around \(23 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{°C}^{-1}\) for aluminum.

Now, we can plug these values into the formula:

\[
\rho_{650} = \frac{2.70 \, \text{g/cm}^3}{1 + (23 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{°C}^{-1} \times 630 \, \text{°C})}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
1 + (23 \times 10^{-6} \times 630) = 1 + 0.01449 = 1.01449
\]

Now, calculate the density at 650°C:

\[
\rho_{650} = \frac{2.70}{1.01449} \approx 2.66 \, \text{g/cm}^3
\]

Therefore, the density of aluminum at 650°C is approximately \(2.66 \, \text{g/cm}^3\).","# TABLE  •  6.1   (continued): (f) Titanium.

as an ore because of its higher Ti content. In recovery of the metal from its ores, the  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  is converted to titanium tetrachloride  $\mathrm{(TiCl_{4})}$  by reacting the compound with  chlorine gas. This is followed by a sequence of distillation steps to remove impurities.  The  highly concentrated  $\mathrm{TiCl_{4}}$  is then reduced to metallic titanium by reaction with  magnesium; this is known as the  Kroll process . Sodium can also be used as a reduc-  ing agent. In either case, an inert atmosphere must be maintained to prevent $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ , $\mathbf{N}_{2}$ ,  or $\mathrm{H}_{2}$  from contaminating the Ti, owing to its chemical affinity for these gases. The  resulting metal is used to cast ingots of titanium and its alloys.  

Properties of Titanium  Ti’s coefficient of thermal expansion is relatively low  among metals. It is stiffer and stronger than aluminum, and it retains good strength  at elevated temperatures. Pure titanium is reactive, which presents problems in  processing, especially in the molten state. However, at room temperature it forms  a thin adherent oxide coating $\left(\mathrm{TiO}_{2}\right)$  that provides excellent corrosion resistance.  

These properties give rise to two principal application areas for titanium: (1) in  the commercially pure state, Ti is used for corrosion resistant components, such as  marine components and prosthetic implants; and (2) titanium alloys are used as  high-strength components in temperatures ranging from ambient to above  $550^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ $(1000^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ), especially where its excellent strength-to-weight ratio is exploited. These  latter applications include aircraft and missile components. Some of the alloying  elements used with titanium include aluminum, manganese, tin, and vanadium.  Some compositions and mechanical properties for several alloys are presented in  Table 6.13.

Aluminum and magnesium are light metals, and they are often specified in engineer-  ing applications for this feature. Both elements are abundant on Earth, aluminum  on land and magnesium in the sea, although neither is easily extracted from their  natural states.  

Properties and other data on aluminum are listed in Table 6.1(b). Among the  major metals, it is a relative newcomer, dating only to the late 1800s (Historical  Note 6.2).

Aluminum Production  The principal aluminum ore is  bauxite , which consists  largely of hydrated aluminum oxide  $(\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}–\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O})$ ) and other oxides. Extraction of  the aluminum from bauxite can be summarized in three steps: (1) washing and  crushing the ore into fine powders; (2) the Bayer process, in which the bauxite is  converted to pure alumina  $\left(\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$ ; and (3) electrolysis, in which the alumina is  separated into aluminum and oxygen gas  $(\mathrm{O}_{2})$ . The  Bayer process , named after the  German chemist who developed it, involves solution of bauxite powders in aque-  ous caustic soda (NaOH) under pressure, followed by precipitation of pure $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ from solution.

Copper  $(\mathrm{Cu})$  is one of the oldest metals known (Historical Note 6.3). Basic data on  the element copper are presented in Table 6.1(d).

Copper was one of the first metals used by human later found that copper mixed with tin could be more cultures  (gold was the other).

ting the metal (cold forging). Pounding copper made it   harder (strain hardening); this and its attractive reddish  color made it valuable in early civilizations.  

Around 4000  B . C . E ., it was discovered that copper  

To the ancient Romans, the island of Cyprus was al-  most the only source of copper. They called the metal  aes cyprium  (ore of Cyprus). This was shortened to  Cyprium  and subsequently renamed  Cuprium . From  

Copper Production  In ancient times, copper was available in nature as a free  element. Today these natural deposits are more difficult to find, and copper is now  extracted from ores that are mostly sulfides, such as  chalcopyrite  $\left(\mathrm{CuFeS}_{2}\right)$ ). The ore  is crushed (Section 16.1.1), concentrated by flotation, and then  smelted  (melted or  fused, often with an associated chemical reaction to separate a metal from its ore).  The resulting copper is called  blister copper , which is between $98\%$  and $99\%$  pure.  Electrolysis is used to obtain higher purity levels suitable for commercial use.  

Properties and Designation Scheme  Pure copper has a distinctive reddish- pink  color, but its most distinguishing engineering property is its low electrical resistivity— one of the lowest of all elements. Because of this property, and its rela- tive abundance  in nature, commercially pure copper is widely used as an electrical conductor. (The  conductivity of copper decreases significantly as alloying elements are added.)  $\mathrm{Cu}$  is  also an excellent thermal conductor.",/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec12456.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec12456.txt; /Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec12456.txt,"[ 0 . 8 1 1 0 9 6 1 9 8 1 2 3 3 4 0 2 ,   0 . 8 0 8 8 0 8 3 5 4 7 8 6 8 1 1 9 ,   0 . 8 0 7 3 5 3 5 8 5 4 4 9 8 0 0 1 ]",4.0,4.3
"With reference to Table 4.1, determine the increase in length of a steel bar whose length = 10.0 in, if the bar is heated from room temperature of 70F to 500F.",Solution: Increase = (6.7 x 10^-6 in/in/F)(10.0 in)(500F -70F) = 0.0288 in.,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the increase in length of a steel bar when it is heated from 70°F to 500°F. We will use the formula for linear thermal expansion:

\[
L_{2} - L_{1} = a \cdot L_{1} \cdot (T_{2} - T_{1})
\]

where:
- \(L_{1}\) is the initial length of the bar,
- \(L_{2}\) is the final length of the bar,
- \(a\) is the coefficient of thermal expansion,
- \(T_{1}\) is the initial temperature,
- \(T_{2}\) is the final temperature.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the given values:**
   - Initial length, \(L_{1} = 10.0\) inches.
   - Initial temperature, \(T_{1} = 70^\circ\text{F}\).
   - Final temperature, \(T_{2} = 500^\circ\text{F}\).

2. **Find the coefficient of thermal expansion for steel:**
   - From the provided information, the coefficient of thermal expansion for steel is typically around \(a = 6.5 \times 10^{-6} \text{ in/in}^\circ\text{F}\). This value can vary slightly depending on the specific type of steel, but this is a common approximation.

3. **Calculate the temperature change:**
   \[
   \Delta T = T_{2} - T_{1} = 500^\circ\text{F} - 70^\circ\text{F} = 430^\circ\text{F}
   \]

4. **Calculate the change in length:**
   \[
   L_{2} - L_{1} = a \cdot L_{1} \cdot \Delta T
   \]
   \[
   L_{2} - L_{1} = 6.5 \times 10^{-6} \text{ in/in}^\circ\text{F} \cdot 10.0 \text{ in} \cdot 430^\circ\text{F}
   \]
   \[
   L_{2} - L_{1} = 6.5 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 10.0 \cdot 430
   \]
   \[
   L_{2} - L_{1} = 0.02795 \text{ in}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The increase in length of the steel bar when heated from 70°F to 500°F is approximately \(0.028\) inches.","The change in  length corresponding to a given temperature change is given by:  

$$
L_{2}-L_{1}=a L_{1}\left(T_{2}-T_{1}\right)
$$  

where $a=$   coefficient of thermal expansion, $^{\circ}\mathbf{C}^{\cdot1}(^{\circ}\mathbf{F}^{\cdot1})$ ; and $L_{1}$  and $L_{2}$  are lengths,  mm (in), corresponding, respectively, to temperatures $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2},\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\ (^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ .  

Values of coefficient of thermal expansion given in Table 4.1 suggest that it has  a linear relationship with temperature. This is only an approximation. Not only is  length affected by temperature, but the thermal expansion coefficient itself is also  affected. For some materials it increases with temperature; for other materials it  decreases. These changes are usually not significant enough to be of much concern,  and values like those in the table are quite useful in design calculations for the range  of temperatures contemplated in service. Changes in the coefficient are more sub-  stantial when the metal undergoes a phase transformation, such as from solid to  liquid, or from one crystal structure to another.  

In manufacturing operations, thermal expansion is put to good use in shrink fit  and expansion fit assemblies (Section 31.3), in which a part is heated to increase its  size or cooled to decrease its size to permit insertion into some other part. When the  part returns to ambient temperature, a tightly fitted assembly is obtained. Thermal  expansion can be a problem in heat treatment (Chapter 26) and welding (Section  29.6) because of thermal stresses that develop in the material during these processes.  

# 4.1.3  MELTING  CHARACTERISTICS  

For a pure element, the  melting point $T_{m}$   is the temperature at which the mate- rial  transforms from solid to liquid state. The reverse transformation, from liquid to  solid,  occurs at the same temperature and is called the  freezing point . For crystalline  elements,  such as metals, the melting and freezing temperatures are the same. A cer- tain  amount of heat energy, called the  heat of fusion , is required at this temperature to  accomplish the transformation from solid to liquid.  

Melting of a metal element at a specific temperature assumes equilibrium condi-  tions. Exceptions occur in nature; for example, when a molten metal is cooled, it may  remain in the liquid state below its freezing point if nucleation of crystals does not  initiate immediately. When this happens, the liquid is said to be  supercooled .  

There are other variations in the melting process—differences in the way melt-  ing occurs in different materials. For example, unlike pure metals, most metal alloys  do not have a single melting point. Instead, melting begins at a certain temperature,   called the  solidus , and continues as   the temperature increases until finally convert-  ing completely to the liquid state at a temperature called the  liquidus . Between the  two temperatures, the alloy is a mixture of solid and molten metals, the amounts of  each being inversely proportional to their relative distances from the liquidus and  solidus. Although most alloys behave in this way, exceptions are eutectic alloys that  

FIGURE 4.1  Changes  in volume per unit  weight (1/density) as a  function of temperature  for a hypothetical pure  metal, alloy, and glass;  all exhibiting similar  thermal expansion and  melting  characteristics.

melt (and freeze) at a single temperature. These issues are examined in the discus-  sion of phase diagrams in Chapter 6.  

Another difference in melting occurs with noncrystalline materials (glasses). In  these materials, there is a gradual transition from solid to liquid states. The solid  material gradually softens as temperature increases, finally becoming liquid at the  melting point. During softening, the material has a consistency of increasing plasticity  (increasingly like a fluid) as it gets closer to the melting point.  

These differences in melting characteristics among pure metals, alloys, and glass  are portrayed in Figure 4.1. These assembly methods are used to ﬁ  t gears, pulleys, sleeves,  and other components onto solid and hollow shafts.  

Various methods are used to heat and/or cool the work parts. Heating equip- ment includes torches, furnaces, electric resistance heaters, and electric induction  heaters. Cooling methods include conventional refrigeration, packing in dry ice,  and immersion in cold liquids, including liquid nitrogen. The resulting change in  diameter depends on the coefﬁ  cient of thermal expansion and the temperature  difference that is applied to the part. If it is assumed that the heating or cooling  has produced a uniform temperature throughout the work, then the change in di- ameter is given by  

$$
D_{2}\!-\!D_{1}=\alpha\,D_{1}(T_{2}\!-\!T_{1})
$$  

where $\alpha=$  the coefﬁ  cient of linear thermal expansion, $\mathrm{mm/mm\cdot^{\circ}C}$  (in/in- $\mathrm{\cdot^{\circ}F}$ ) for the  material (see Table 4.1);  $T_{2}=$  the temperature to which the parts have been heated  or cooled, $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $\mathrm{(^{\circ}F)}$ ;  $T_{1}=$  starting ambient temperature;  $D_{2}=$  diameter of the part at  $T_{2},\mathrm{mm}$ $D_{\scriptscriptstyle1}=$  diameter of the part at  $T_{1}$ .  

Equations (31.5) through (31.9) for computing interference pressures and  effective stresses can be used to determine the corresponding values for shrink and  expansion ﬁ  ts.  

# Example 31.2  Expansion ﬁ  t  

An alloy steel shaft is to be inserted into a collar of the same metal using an  expansion ﬁ  t. At room temperature  $(20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ , the outer and inner diameters  of the collar $=50.00\:\mathrm{mm}$  and  $30.00\:\mathrm{mm}$ , respectively, and the shaft has a  diameter  $=30.015\:\mathrm{mm}$ . The shaft must be reduced in size for assembly into  the collar by cooling to a sufﬁ  ciently low temperature that there is a  clearance of  $0.03\;\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) the temperature to which the shaft  must be cooled for assembly, (b) the radial pressure at room temperature  after assembly, and (c) the maximum effective stress on the collar.

Solution:  (a) From Table 4.1, the coefﬁ  cient of thermal expansion for steel  $\alpha=12(10^{-6})\mathrm{\,^{\circ}C^{-1}}$ . Rearranging Equation 31.10 to solve for the cooling  temperature,  

$$
T_{2}={\frac{(D2-D_{1})}{\alpha\,D_{1}}}+\,T_{1}={\frac{(30.00-0.03)-30.015}{12(10^{-6})(30.015)}}+20=-124.9+20=-104.9^{\circ}{\bf C}

a second. When the power is turned off, the area, usually a narrow line as in the  ﬁ  gure, is quenched by heat transfer to the surrounding metal. Depth of the treated  area is around  $0.63\ \mathrm{mm}$  (0.025 in.); hardness depends on carbon content of the  steel and can range up to  $60\,\mathrm{HRC}$  [11].  

Electron beam  $(E B)$  heating  involves localized surface hardening of steel in  which the electron beam is focused onto a small area, resulting in rapid heat buildup.  Austenitizing temperatures can often be achieved in less than a second. When the  directed beam is removed, the heated area is immediately quenched and hardened  by heat transfer to the surrounding cold metal. A disadvantage of EB heating is  that best results are achieved when the process is performed in a vacuum. A special  vacuum chamber is needed, and time is required to draw the vacuum, thus slowing  production rates.  

Laser beam  $(L B)$  heating  uses a high-intensity beam of coherent light focused on a  small area. The beam is usually moved along a deﬁ  ned path on the work surface, caus- ing heating of the steel into the austenite region. When the beam is moved, the area  is immediately quenched by heat conduction to the surrounding metal.  Laser  is an  acronym for  l ight  a mpliﬁ  cation by  s timulated  e mission of  r adiation. The advantage of  LB over EB heating is that laser beams do not require a vacuum to achieve best results.  Energy density levels in EB and LB heating are lower than in cutting or welding.

" With reference to Table 4.2, determine the quantity of heat required to increase the temperature of an 
aluminum block that is 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm from room temperature (21C) to 300C. ","Solution. Heat = (0.21 cal/g C)(103 cm3
)(2.70 g/cm3
)(300qC - 21C) = 158,193 cal.
Conversion: 1.0 cal = 4.184J, so heat = 662,196 J.","To determine the quantity of heat required to increase the temperature of an aluminum block from room temperature (21°C) to 300°C, we need to use the formula for calculating the heat required to raise the temperature of a solid:

\[ 
Q = m \cdot C_s \cdot \Delta T 
\]

where:
- \( Q \) is the heat required (in Joules),
- \( m \) is the mass of the aluminum block (in grams),
- \( C_s \) is the specific heat capacity of aluminum (in J/g°C),
- \( \Delta T \) is the change in temperature (in °C).

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the aluminum block.**

The dimensions of the block are 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, so the volume \( V \) is:

\[ 
V = 10 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} = 1000 \, \text{cm}^3 
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the mass of the aluminum block.**

The density \( \rho \) of aluminum is approximately 2.7 g/cm³. Therefore, the mass \( m \) is:

\[ 
m = \rho \cdot V = 2.7 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \times 1000 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2700 \, \text{g} 
\]

**Step 3: Determine the specific heat capacity of aluminum.**

The specific heat capacity \( C_s \) of aluminum is approximately 0.897 J/g°C.

**Step 4: Calculate the change in temperature.**

The change in temperature \( \Delta T \) is:

\[ 
\Delta T = 300^\circ\text{C} - 21^\circ\text{C} = 279^\circ\text{C} 
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the heat required.**

Substitute the values into the heat equation:

\[ 
Q = m \cdot C_s \cdot \Delta T = 2700 \, \text{g} \times 0.897 \, \text{J/g°C} \times 279^\circ\text{C} 
\]

\[ 
Q = 2700 \times 0.897 \times 279 
\]

\[ 
Q = 676,509.3 \, \text{J} 
\]

Therefore, the quantity of heat required to increase the temperature of the aluminum block from 21°C to 300°C is approximately 676,509.3 Joules.","In permanent metal molds, small vent holes are drilled into the mold or  machined into the parting line to permit removal of air and gases.  

#  Heating and Pouring  

To perform a casting operation, the metal must be heated to a temperature some- what above its melting point and then poured into the mold cavity to solidify. Several  aspects of these two steps are discussed in this section.  

# 10.2.1  HEATING THE METAL  

Heating furnaces of various kinds (Section 11.4.1) are used to heat the metal to a  molten temperature sufﬁ  cient for casting. The heat energy required is the sum of (1)  the heat to raise the temperature to the melting point, (2) the heat of fusion to con- vert it from solid to liquid, and (3) the heat to raise the molten metal to the desired  temperature for pouring. This can be expressed:  

$$
H=\rho\,V\{C_{s}\,(T_{m}-\,T_{o})+\,H_{f}+\,C_{l}\,(T_{p}\,-\,T_{m})\}
$$  

where  $H=$  total heat required to raise the temperature of the metal to the pour- ing temperature, J (Btu); $\rho=$  density,  $\mathrm{{g}/\mathrm{{cm}}^{3}}$   $\left(1\mathrm{b}\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{in}^{3}\right)$ ;  $C_{s}=$  weight speciﬁ  c heat for  the solid metal,  $\mathrm{J/g-C}$  (Btu/lbm-F);  $T_{m}=$  melting temperature of the metal, C (F);  $T_{o}=$  starting temperature—usually ambient,  $\mathrm{C}$  (F);  $H_{f}=$  heat of fusion,  $\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{g}$  ( $\mathrm{{'Bup/}}$ lbm);  $C_{1}=$  weight speciﬁ  c heat of the liquid metal, $\mathrm{J/g-C}$  (Btu/lbm-F);  $T_{p}=$  pouring  temperature, C (F); and  $V=$  volume of metal being heated, $\mathrm{cm}^{3}\left(\mathrm{in}^{3}\right)$ .  

# Example 10.1  Heating metal  for casting  

One cubic meter of a certain eutectic alloy is heated in a crucible from room  temperature to $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  above its melting point for casting. The alloy’s density $=$ $7.5\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , melting point $=800^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , speciﬁ  c heat $=0.33\;\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{g}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  in the solid state  and $0.29\,\mathrm{J/g^{\circ}C}$  in the liquid state; and heat of fusion $=160\,\mathrm{J/g}$ . How much heat  energy must be added to accomplish the heating, assuming no losses?  

Solution :  Assume ambient temperature in the foundry $=25^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and that the  density of the liquid and solid states of the metal are the same. Noting that one  $\mathsf{m}^{3}=10^{6}\,\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , and substituting the property values into Equation (10.1),  

$H=(7.5)\,(10^{6})\{0.33(800-25)+160+0.29\,(100)\}=3335(10^{6})\,\mathrm{J}$ The above equation is of conceptual value, but its computational value is limited,  

notwithstanding the calculation in Example 10.1. Use of Equation (10.1) is com- plicated by the following factors: (1) Speciﬁ  c heat and other thermal properties of  a solid metal vary with temperature, especially if the metal undergoes a change of  phase during heating. (2) A metal’s speciﬁ  c heat may be different in the solid and  liquid states. Noting that one  $\mathsf{m}^{3}=10^{6}\,\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , and substituting the property values into Equation (10.1),  

$H=(7.5)\,(10^{6})\{0.33(800-25)+160+0.29\,(100)\}=3335(10^{6})\,\mathrm{J}$ The above equation is of conceptual value, but its computational value is limited,  

notwithstanding the calculation in Example 10.1. Use of Equation (10.1) is com- plicated by the following factors: (1) Speciﬁ  c heat and other thermal properties of  a solid metal vary with temperature, especially if the metal undergoes a change of  phase during heating. (2) A metal’s speciﬁ  c heat may be different in the solid and  liquid states. (3) Most casting metals are alloys, and most alloys melt over a tem- perature range between a solidus and liquidus rather than at a single melting point;  thus, the heat of fusion cannot be applied so simply as indicated above. (4) The  property values required in the equation for a particular alloy are not readily avail- able in most cases. (5) There are signiﬁ  cant heat losses to the environment during  heating.  

# 10.2.2  POURING THE MOLTEN METAL  

After heating, the metal is ready for pouring. Introduction of molten metal into the  mold, including its ﬂ  ow through the gating system and into the cavity, is a critical  step in the casting process. For this step to be successful, the metal must ﬂ  ow into  all regions of the mold before solidifying. Factors affecting the pouring operation  include pouring temperature, pouring rate, and turbulence.  

The  pouring temperature  is the temperature of the molten metal as it is intro- duced into the mold. What is important here is the difference between the tempera- ture at pouring and the temperature at which freezing begins (the melting point for  a pure metal or the liquidus temperature for an alloy). This temperature difference is  sometimes referred to as the  superheat . This term is also used for the amount of heat  that must be removed from the molten metal between pouring and when solidiﬁ  ca- tion commences [7].  

Pouring rate  refers to the volumetric rate at which the molten metal is poured  into the mold. If the rate is too slow, the metal will chill and freeze before ﬁ  lling the  cavity. If the pouring rate is excessive, turbulence can become a serious problem.  Turbulence  in ﬂ  uid ﬂ  ow is characterized by erratic variations in the magnitude and  direction of the velocity throughout the ﬂ  uid. The ﬂ  ow is agitated and irregular  rather than smooth and streamlined, as in laminar ﬂ  ow. Turbulent ﬂ  ow should be  avoided during pouring for several reasons. It tends to accelerate the formation  of metal oxides that can become entrapped during solidiﬁ  cation, thus degrading  the quality of the casting. Turbulence also aggravates  mold erosion , the gradual  wearing away of the mold surfaces due to impact of the ﬂ  owing molten metal.  The densities of most molten metals are much higher than water and other ﬂ  uids  normally encountered. These molten metals are also much more chemically reac- tive than at room temperature. Consequently, the wear caused by the ﬂ  ow of these  metals in the mold is signiﬁ  cant, especially under turbulent conditions. Erosion is  especially serious when it occurs in the main cavity because the geometry of the  cast part is affected.  

# 10.2.3  ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF POURING  

There are several relationships that govern the ﬂ  ow of liquid metal through  the gating system and into the mold. An important relationship is  Bernoulli’s  theorem , which states that the sum of the energies (head, pressure, kinetic, and  friction) at any two points in a ﬂ  owing liquid are equal. # 28.3.2  HEAT BALANCE IN FUSION WELDING  

The quantity of heat required to melt a given volume of metal depends on (1) the  heat to raise the temperature of the solid metal to its melting point, which depends  on the metal’s volumetric speciﬁ  c heat, (2) the melting point of the metal, and (3)  the heat to transform the metal from solid to liquid phase at the melting point, which  depends on the metal’s heat of fusion. To a reasonable approximation, this quantity  of heat can be estimated by the following equation [5]:  

$$
U_{m}=K T_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}
$$  

where  $U_{m}=$  the unit energy for melting (i.e., the quantity of heat required to melt a  unit volume of metal starting from room temperature), $\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{mm}^{3}\left(\mathrm{Btu}/\mathrm{in}^{3}\right)$ ;  $T_{m}=$ melt- ing point of the metal on an absolute temperature scale, $^{\circ}\mathrm{K}\left(^{\circ}\mathrm{R}\right)$ ; and  $K=$  constant  whose value is $3.33\times10^{-6}$  when the Kelvin scale is used (and  $K=1.467\times10^{-5}$  for  the Rankine temperature scale). Absolute melting temperatures for selected metals  are presented in Table 28.2.  

Not all of the energy generated at the heat source is used to melt the weld metal.  There are two heat transfer mechanisms at work, both of which reduce the amount  of generated heat that is used by the welding process. The situation is depicted in  Figure 28.8. The ﬁ  rst mechanism involves the transfer of heat between the heat source  and the surface of the work. This process has a certain  heat transfer factor $f_{1}$ , deﬁ  ned as  the ratio of the actual heat received by the workpiece divided by the total heat gener- ated at the source. The second mechanism involves the conduction of heat away from  the weld area to be dissipated throughout the work metal, so that only a portion of the  heat transferred to the surface is available for melting. This  melting factor $f_{2}$  is the pro- portion of heat received at the work surface that can be used for melting. The combined  effect of these two factors is to reduce the heat energy available for welding as follows:  

$$
H_{w}=f_{1}f_{2}H
$$

where $H_{w}\!=$  net heat available for welding, J (Btu), $f_{1}=$  heat transfer factor, $f_{2}=$  the  melting factor, and $H=$  the total heat generated by the welding process, J (Btu).  

The factors $f_{1}$  and $f_{2}$  range in value between zero and one. It is appropriate to  separate $f_{1}$  and $f_{2}$  in concept, even though they act in concert during the welding  process. The heat transfer factor $f_{1}$  is determined largely by the welding process and  the capacity to convert the power source (e.g., electrical energy) into usable heat at  the work surface. Arc-welding processes are relatively efﬁ  cient in this regard, while  oxyfuel gas-welding processes are relatively inefﬁ  cient.  

The melting factor $f_{2}$  depends on the welding process, but it is also inﬂ  uenced  by the thermal properties of the metal, joint conﬁ  guration, and work thickness.  Metals with high thermal conductivity, such as aluminum and copper, present a  problem in welding because of the rapid dissipation of heat away from the heat  contact area. The problem is exacerbated by welding heat sources with low energy

What is the resistance R of a length of copper wire whose length = 10 m and whose diameter = 0.10 mm? Use Table 4.3 as a reference.,"Solution: R = rL/A, A = pi(0.1)^2/4 = 0.007854 mm2 = 0.007854(10^-6) m2 From Table 4.3, r = 1.7 x 10^-8 -m2/m  R = (1.7 x 10^-8  ohm-m2/m)(10 m)/( 0.007854(10^-6) m2) = 2164.5(10^-2) : = 21.65 ohm","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the electrical resistance \( R \) of a copper wire given its length and diameter. The resistance of a wire can be calculated using the formula:

\[
R = \rho \frac{L}{A}
\]

where:
- \( R \) is the resistance,
- \( \rho \) is the resistivity of the material (copper in this case),
- \( L \) is the length of the wire,
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the wire.

### Step 1: Find the Resistivity of Copper
The resistivity (\( \rho \)) of copper is typically around \( 1.68 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \). This value can be found in standard tables of material properties.

### Step 2: Calculate the Cross-Sectional Area
The wire is cylindrical, so its cross-sectional area \( A \) can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle:

\[
A = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2
\]

where \( d \) is the diameter of the wire. Given \( d = 0.10 \, \text{mm} = 0.10 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} = 0.0001 \, \text{m} \), we have:

\[
A = \pi \left(\frac{0.0001}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \left(0.00005\right)^2 = \pi \times 2.5 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}^2
\]

\[
A \approx 7.85 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Resistance
Now, substitute the values into the resistance formula:

\[
R = \rho \frac{L}{A} = (1.68 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m}) \frac{10 \, \text{m}}{7.85 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}^2}
\]

\[
R = (1.68 \times 10^{-8}) \times \frac{10}{7.85 \times 10^{-9}}
\]

\[
R = (1.68 \times 10^{-8}) \times 1.274 \times 10^{9}
\]

\[
R \approx 21.4 \, \Omega
\]

Thus, the resistance \( R \) of the copper wire is approximately \( 21.4 \, \Omega \).","This can be expressed  by the equation  

$$
H=I^{2}R t
$$  

where $H=$  heat generated, $\mathrm{J}$  (to convert to Btu divide by 1055); $I=$ current, $\mathbf{A};R=$ electrical resistance, $\Omega$ ; and  $t=$  time, s.

FIGURE 29.12  Resistance welding  (RW), showing the  components in  spot welding, the  predominant process in  the RW group.  

The current used in resistance welding operations is very high (5000–20,000 A,  typically), although voltage is relatively low (usually below  $10\,\mathrm{V}$ ). The duration $t$  of  the current is short in most processes, perhaps lasting 0.1 to  $0.4~\mathrm{s}$  in a typical spot- welding operation.  

The reason why such a high current is used in RW is because (1) the squared term  in Equation (29.3) ampliﬁ  es the effect of current, and (2) the resistance is very low  (around  $0.0001\;\Omega$ ). Resistance in the welding circuit is the sum of (1) resistance of  the electrodes, (2) resistances of the work parts, (3) contact resistances between elec- trodes and work parts, and (4) contact resistance of the faying surfaces. Thus, heat  is generated in all of these regions of electrical resistance. The ideal situation is for  the faying surfaces to be the largest resistance in the sum, because this is the desired  location of the weld. The resistance of the electrodes is minimized by using metals  with very low resistivities, such as copper. Also, the electrodes are often water cooled  to dissipate the heat that is generated there. The work part resistances are a function  of the resistivities of the base metals and the part thicknesses. The contact resist- ances between the electrodes and the parts are determined by the contact areas (i.e.,  size and shape of the electrode) and the condition of the surfaces (e.g., cleanliness  of the work surfaces and scale on the electrode). Finally, the resistance at the faying  surfaces depends on surface ﬁ  nish, cleanliness, contact area, and pressure. No paint,  oil, dirt, or other contaminants should be present to separate the contacting surfaces.  

# Example 29.2  Resistance  welding  

A resistance spot-welding operation performed on two pieces of $2.5\mathrm{-mm}$ -thick  sheet steel uses 12,000 amps for a 0.20-s duration. The electrodes are  $6\,\mathrm{mm}$  in  diameter at the contacting surfaces. Resistance is assumed to be $0.0001\;\Omega$ , and  the resulting weld nugget $6\:\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter and averages $3\:\mathrm{mm}$  in thickness.  The unit melting energy for the metal  $U_{m}=12.0\:\mathrm{J/mm}^{3}$ . What portion of the  heat generated was used to form the weld nugget, and what portion was dis- sipated into the work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air?  

Solution:   The heat generated in the operation is given by Equation (29.3) as.  

$$
H=(12,\!000)^{2}(0.0001)(0.2)=2880\,\mathrm{J}
$$  

The volume of the weld nugget (assumed disc-shaped) is  $\nu=3.0\frac{\pi(6)^{2}}{4}=$ $84.8\;\mathrm{mm}^{3}$ .  

The heat required to melt this volume of metal is  $H w=84.8(12.0)=\mathbf{1018\,J}$ .   The remaining heat,  $\begin{array}{r}{2880{-}1018=1862\;\mathbf{J}}\end{array}$   $(64.7\%$  of the total), is lost into the  work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air. In effect, this loss represents  the combined effect of the heat transfer factor $f_{1}$  and melting factor $f_{2}$   (Section 28.3.2). The heat required to melt this volume of metal is  $H w=84.8(12.0)=\mathbf{1018\,J}$ .   The remaining heat,  $\begin{array}{r}{2880{-}1018=1862\;\mathbf{J}}\end{array}$   $(64.7\%$  of the total), is lost into the  work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air. In effect, this loss represents  the combined effect of the heat transfer factor $f_{1}$  and melting factor $f_{2}$   (Section 28.3.2).  

Success in resistance welding depends on pressure as well as heat. The principal  functions of pressure in RW are to (1) force contact between the electrodes and  the work parts and between the two work surfaces prior to applying current, and  (2) press the faying surfaces together to accomplish coalescence when the proper  welding temperature has been reached.  

General advantages of resistance welding include (1) no ﬁ  ller metal is re- quired, (2) high production rates are possible, (3) lends itself to mechanization and  automation, (4) operator skill level is lower than that required for arc welding, and  (5) good repeatability and reliability. Drawbacks are (1) equipment cost is high— usually much higher than most arc-welding operations, and (2) types of joints that  can be welded are limited to lap joints for most RW processes.  

# 29.2.2  RESISTANCE-WELDING PROCESSES  

The resistance-welding processes of most commercial importance are spot, seam,  and projection welding.  

Resistance Spot Welding  Resistance spot welding is by far the predominant  process in this group. It is widely used in mass production of automobiles, appliances,  metal furniture, and other products made of sheet metal. If one considers that a  typical car body has approximately 10,000 individual spot welds, and that the annual  production of automobiles throughout the world is measured in tens of millions of  units, the economic importance of resistance spot welding can be appreciated.  

Resistance spot welding  (RSW) is an RW process in which fusion of the faying  surfaces of a lap joint is achieved at one location by opposing electrodes. The process  is used to join sheet-metal parts of thickness  $3~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.125 in) or less, using a series  of spot welds, in situations where an airtight assembly is not required. The size and  shape of the weld spot is determined by the electrode tip, the most common elec- trode shape being round, but hexagonal, square, and other shapes are also used. The  resulting weld nugget is typically 5 to  $10\;\mathrm{mm}\;(0.2–0.4\;\mathrm{in})$  in diameter, with a heat- affected zone extending slightly beyond the nugget into the base metals. If the weld  is made properly, its strength will be comparable to that of the surrounding metal.  The steps in a spot welding cycle are depicted in Figure 29.13.  

![](images/3439fb98fe357a6b0093316099324f51525a4ebbc74db2c99922a6a8305f4da0.jpg)  
FIGURE 29.13  (a)  Steps in a resistance  spot-welding (RSW)  cycle, and (b) plot of  squeezing force and  current during cycle.  The sequence is: (1)  parts inserted between  open electrodes, (2)  electrodes close and  force is applied, (3)  weld time—current is  switched on, (4) cur- rent is turned off but  force is maintained or  increased (a reduced  current is sometimes  applied near the end of  this step for stress re- lief in the weld region),  and (5) electrodes are  opened, and the welded  assembly is removed.  

![](images/099497798d3d7405cbea4c9b6d703010ce5e7f2316e753b9f06a7ac9075c4537.jpg)  

Materials used for RSW electrodes consist of two main groups: (1) copper-based  alloys and (2) refractory metal compositions such as copper and tungsten combina- tions. The second group is noted for superior wear resistance. As in most manufactur- ing processes, the tooling in spot welding gradually wears out as it is used. The units of  $R_{H w}$  are watts (current multiplied by voltage), which equal  J/sec. This can be converted to Btu/sec by recalling that $1{\mathrm{~Bun}}=1055{\mathrm{~J}},$ , and thus 1  $\mathrm{Blu/sec}=1055$  watts.  

# Example 29.1  Power in arc  welding  

A gas tungsten arc welding operation is performed at a current of $300\,\mathrm{A}$  and  voltage of $20\,\mathrm{V}.$  The melting factor $f_{2}=0.5$ , and the unit melting energy for the  metal  $U_{m}=10\:\mathrm{J/mm^{3}}$ . Determine (a) power in the operation, (b) rate of heat  generation at the weld, and (c) volume rate of metal welded.  

Solution:   (a) The power in this arc-welding operation is  

$$
P=I E=(300\,\mathrm{A})(20\,\mathrm{V})=\mathbf{6000}\,\mathbf{W}
$$  

(b) From Table 29.1, the heat transfer factor $f_{1}=0.7$ . The rate of heat used for  welding is given by  

$$
R_{H w}=f_{1}\,f_{2}\,I\,E=(0.7)(0.5)(6000)=2100\,\mathrm{W}=2100\,\mathrm{J/s}
$$  

(c) The volume rate of metal welded is  

$R_{V W}=(2100\:\mathrm{J/s})/(10\:\mathrm{J/mm^{3}})=210\:\mathrm{mm^{3}/s}$  

# 29.1.2  AW PROCESSES—CONSUMABLE ELECTRODES  

A number of important arc-welding processes use consumable electrodes. These are  discussed in this section. Symbols for the welding processes are those used by the  American Welding Society.  

Shielded Metal Arc Welding   Shielded metal arc welding  (SMAW) is an AW  process that uses a consumable electrode consisting of a ﬁ  ller metal rod coated with  chemicals that provide ﬂ  ux and shielding. The process is illustrated in Figures 29.2  and 29.3. The welding stick (SMAW is sometimes called  stick welding ) is typically  225 to  $450\;\mathrm{mm}$  (9–18 in) long and 2.5 to  $9.5\;\mathrm{mm}$  (3/32–3/8 in) in diameter. The ﬁ  ller  metal used in the rod must be compatible with the metal to be welded, the com- position usually being very close to that of the base metal. The coating consists of  powdered cellulose (i.e., cotton and wood powders) mixed with oxides, carbonates,  and other ingredients, held together by a silicate binder. Metal powders are also  sometimes included in the coating to increase the amount of ﬁ  ller metal and to add  alloying elements. The heat of the welding process melts the coating to provide a  protective atmosphere and slag for the welding operation. It also helps to stabilize  the arc and regulate the rate at which the electrode melts.

During operation the bare metal end of the welding stick (opposite the welding  tip) is clamped in an electrode holder that is connected to the power source.

"A 16 gage nickel wire (0.0508-in diameter) connects a solenoid to a control circuit that is 32.8 ft away. (a) What is the resistance of the wire? Use Table 4.3 as a reference.

Since nickel is a metal, the resistivity would increase, causing the resistance to increase. This, in turn, would cause slightly more heat to be generated.","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the resistance of a 16-gauge nickel wire and understand how heating affects its resistance. Let's break it down step by step.

### (a) Calculating the Resistance of the Wire

1. **Determine the Length of the Wire in Consistent Units:**
   - The wire is 32.8 feet long. We need to convert this to inches because the diameter is given in inches.
   - \( 32.8 \text{ ft} \times 12 \text{ in/ft} = 393.6 \text{ in} \).

2. **Find the Cross-Sectional Area of the Wire:**
   - The diameter of the wire is 0.0508 inches.
   - The cross-sectional area \( A \) of a wire is given by the formula for the area of a circle: 
     \[
     A = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \left(\frac{0.0508}{2}\right)^2 \approx 0.002026 \text{ in}^2
     \]

3. **Determine the Resistivity of Nickel:**
   - From Table 4.3 (not provided here, but typically available in textbooks or online), let's assume the resistivity \( \rho \) of nickel is approximately \( 6.99 \times 10^{-7} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \).
   - Convert resistivity to consistent units (inches):
     \[
     \rho = 6.99 \times 10^{-7} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \times \left(\frac{39.37 \text{ in}}{1 \text{ m}}\right) = 2.75 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{in}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Resistance Using the Formula:**
   - The resistance \( R \) of a wire is given by:
     \[
     R = \rho \frac{L}{A}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     R = 2.75 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{in} \times \frac{393.6 \text{ in}}{0.002026 \text{ in}^2} \approx 5.33 \, \Omega
     \]

### (b) Effect of Heating on Resistance

When a current passes through the wire, it generates heat due to the resistance. This heat increases the temperature of the wire, which in turn affects its resistance. For most metals, including nickel, resistance increases with temperature. This is due to the increased vibration of atoms in the metal lattice, which impedes the flow of electrons.

- **Temperature Coefficient of Resistance:**
  - Metals have a positive temperature coefficient of resistance, meaning their resistance increases with temperature.
  - The change in resistance with temperature can be expressed as:
    \[
    R_t = R_0 (1 + \alpha \Delta T)
    \]
  - Where \( R_t \) is the resistance at temperature \( T \), \( R_0 \) is the original resistance, \( \alpha \) is the temperature coefficient of resistance for nickel (approximately \( 0.006 \, \text{per degree Celsius} \)), and \( \Delta T \) is the change in temperature.

In summary, the resistance of the wire is approximately \( 5.33 \, \Omega \), and it will increase as the wire heats up due to the current passing through it.","This can be expressed  by the equation  

$$
H=I^{2}R t
$$  

where $H=$  heat generated, $\mathrm{J}$  (to convert to Btu divide by 1055); $I=$ current, $\mathbf{A};R=$ electrical resistance, $\Omega$ ; and  $t=$  time, s.

FIGURE 29.12  Resistance welding  (RW), showing the  components in  spot welding, the  predominant process in  the RW group.  

The current used in resistance welding operations is very high (5000–20,000 A,  typically), although voltage is relatively low (usually below  $10\,\mathrm{V}$ ). The duration $t$  of  the current is short in most processes, perhaps lasting 0.1 to  $0.4~\mathrm{s}$  in a typical spot- welding operation.  

The reason why such a high current is used in RW is because (1) the squared term  in Equation (29.3) ampliﬁ  es the effect of current, and (2) the resistance is very low  (around  $0.0001\;\Omega$ ). Resistance in the welding circuit is the sum of (1) resistance of  the electrodes, (2) resistances of the work parts, (3) contact resistances between elec- trodes and work parts, and (4) contact resistance of the faying surfaces. Thus, heat  is generated in all of these regions of electrical resistance. The ideal situation is for  the faying surfaces to be the largest resistance in the sum, because this is the desired  location of the weld. The resistance of the electrodes is minimized by using metals  with very low resistivities, such as copper. Also, the electrodes are often water cooled  to dissipate the heat that is generated there. The work part resistances are a function  of the resistivities of the base metals and the part thicknesses. The contact resist- ances between the electrodes and the parts are determined by the contact areas (i.e.,  size and shape of the electrode) and the condition of the surfaces (e.g., cleanliness  of the work surfaces and scale on the electrode). Finally, the resistance at the faying  surfaces depends on surface ﬁ  nish, cleanliness, contact area, and pressure. No paint,  oil, dirt, or other contaminants should be present to separate the contacting surfaces.  

# Example 29.2  Resistance  welding  

A resistance spot-welding operation performed on two pieces of $2.5\mathrm{-mm}$ -thick  sheet steel uses 12,000 amps for a 0.20-s duration. The electrodes are  $6\,\mathrm{mm}$  in  diameter at the contacting surfaces. Resistance is assumed to be $0.0001\;\Omega$ , and  the resulting weld nugget $6\:\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter and averages $3\:\mathrm{mm}$  in thickness.  The unit melting energy for the metal  $U_{m}=12.0\:\mathrm{J/mm}^{3}$ . What portion of the  heat generated was used to form the weld nugget, and what portion was dis- sipated into the work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air?  

Solution:   The heat generated in the operation is given by Equation (29.3) as.  

$$
H=(12,\!000)^{2}(0.0001)(0.2)=2880\,\mathrm{J}
$$  

The volume of the weld nugget (assumed disc-shaped) is  $\nu=3.0\frac{\pi(6)^{2}}{4}=$ $84.8\;\mathrm{mm}^{3}$ .  

The heat required to melt this volume of metal is  $H w=84.8(12.0)=\mathbf{1018\,J}$ .   The remaining heat,  $\begin{array}{r}{2880{-}1018=1862\;\mathbf{J}}\end{array}$   $(64.7\%$  of the total), is lost into the  work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air. In effect, this loss represents  the combined effect of the heat transfer factor $f_{1}$  and melting factor $f_{2}$   (Section 28.3.2). The heat required to melt this volume of metal is  $H w=84.8(12.0)=\mathbf{1018\,J}$ .   The remaining heat,  $\begin{array}{r}{2880{-}1018=1862\;\mathbf{J}}\end{array}$   $(64.7\%$  of the total), is lost into the  work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air. In effect, this loss represents  the combined effect of the heat transfer factor $f_{1}$  and melting factor $f_{2}$   (Section 28.3.2).  

Success in resistance welding depends on pressure as well as heat. The principal  functions of pressure in RW are to (1) force contact between the electrodes and  the work parts and between the two work surfaces prior to applying current, and  (2) press the faying surfaces together to accomplish coalescence when the proper  welding temperature has been reached.  

General advantages of resistance welding include (1) no ﬁ  ller metal is re- quired, (2) high production rates are possible, (3) lends itself to mechanization and  automation, (4) operator skill level is lower than that required for arc welding, and  (5) good repeatability and reliability. Drawbacks are (1) equipment cost is high— usually much higher than most arc-welding operations, and (2) types of joints that  can be welded are limited to lap joints for most RW processes.  

# 29.2.2  RESISTANCE-WELDING PROCESSES  

The resistance-welding processes of most commercial importance are spot, seam,  and projection welding.  

Resistance Spot Welding  Resistance spot welding is by far the predominant  process in this group. It is widely used in mass production of automobiles, appliances,  metal furniture, and other products made of sheet metal. If one considers that a  typical car body has approximately 10,000 individual spot welds, and that the annual  production of automobiles throughout the world is measured in tens of millions of  units, the economic importance of resistance spot welding can be appreciated.  

Resistance spot welding  (RSW) is an RW process in which fusion of the faying  surfaces of a lap joint is achieved at one location by opposing electrodes. The process  is used to join sheet-metal parts of thickness  $3~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.125 in) or less, using a series  of spot welds, in situations where an airtight assembly is not required. The size and  shape of the weld spot is determined by the electrode tip, the most common elec- trode shape being round, but hexagonal, square, and other shapes are also used. The  resulting weld nugget is typically 5 to  $10\;\mathrm{mm}\;(0.2–0.4\;\mathrm{in})$  in diameter, with a heat- affected zone extending slightly beyond the nugget into the base metals. If the weld  is made properly, its strength will be comparable to that of the surrounding metal.  The steps in a spot welding cycle are depicted in Figure 29.13.

FIGURE 29.13  (a)  Steps in a resistance  spot-welding (RSW)  cycle, and (b) plot of  squeezing force and  current during cycle.  The sequence is: (1)  parts inserted between  open electrodes, (2)  electrodes close and  force is applied, (3)  weld time—current is  switched on, (4) cur- rent is turned off but  force is maintained or  increased (a reduced  current is sometimes  applied near the end of  this step for stress re- lief in the weld region),  and (5) electrodes are  opened, and the welded  assembly is removed.

Materials used for RSW electrodes consist of two main groups: (1) copper-based  alloys and (2) refractory metal compositions such as copper and tungsten combina- tions. The second group is noted for superior wear resistance. As in most manufactur- ing processes, the tooling in spot welding gradually wears out as it is used. The units of  $R_{H w}$  are watts (current multiplied by voltage), which equal  J/sec. This can be converted to Btu/sec by recalling that $1{\mathrm{~Bun}}=1055{\mathrm{~J}},$ , and thus 1  $\mathrm{Blu/sec}=1055$  watts.  

# Example 29.1  Power in arc  welding  

A gas tungsten arc welding operation is performed at a current of $300\,\mathrm{A}$  and  voltage of $20\,\mathrm{V}.$  The melting factor $f_{2}=0.5$ , and the unit melting energy for the  metal  $U_{m}=10\:\mathrm{J/mm^{3}}$ . Determine (a) power in the operation, (b) rate of heat  generation at the weld, and (c) volume rate of metal welded.  

Solution:   (a) The power in this arc-welding operation is  

$$
P=I E=(300\,\mathrm{A})(20\,\mathrm{V})=\mathbf{6000}\,\mathbf{W}
$$  

(b) From Table 29.1, the heat transfer factor $f_{1}=0.7$ . The rate of heat used for  welding is given by  

$$
R_{H w}=f_{1}\,f_{2}\,I\,E=(0.7)(0.5)(6000)=2100\,\mathrm{W}=2100\,\mathrm{J/s}
$$  

(c) The volume rate of metal welded is  

$R_{V W}=(2100\:\mathrm{J/s})/(10\:\mathrm{J/mm^{3}})=210\:\mathrm{mm^{3}/s}$  

# 29.1.2  AW PROCESSES—CONSUMABLE ELECTRODES  

A number of important arc-welding processes use consumable electrodes. These are  discussed in this section. Symbols for the welding processes are those used by the  American Welding Society.  

Shielded Metal Arc Welding   Shielded metal arc welding  (SMAW) is an AW  process that uses a consumable electrode consisting of a ﬁ  ller metal rod coated with  chemicals that provide ﬂ  ux and shielding. The process is illustrated in Figures 29.2  and 29.3. The welding stick (SMAW is sometimes called  stick welding ) is typically  225 to  $450\;\mathrm{mm}$  (9–18 in) long and 2.5 to  $9.5\;\mathrm{mm}$  (3/32–3/8 in) in diameter. The ﬁ  ller  metal used in the rod must be compatible with the metal to be welded, the com- position usually being very close to that of the base metal. The coating consists of  powdered cellulose (i.e., cotton and wood powders) mixed with oxides, carbonates,  and other ingredients, held together by a silicate binder. Metal powders are also  sometimes included in the coating to increase the amount of ﬁ  ller metal and to add  alloying elements. The heat of the welding process melts the coating to provide a  protective atmosphere and slag for the welding operation. It also helps to stabilize  the arc and regulate the rate at which the electrode melts.

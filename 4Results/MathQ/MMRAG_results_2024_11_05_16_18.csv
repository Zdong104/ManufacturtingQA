A tensile test for a certain metal provides flow curve parameters: strain-hardening exponent is 0.3 and strength coefficient is 600 MPa. Determine (a) the flow stress at a true strain = 1.0 and (b) true strain at a flow stress = 600 MPa.,Solution: (a) Yf = 600(1.0)^.3 = 600 MPa (b) H = (600/600)^(1/.3) = (1.0)^3.33 = 1.00,"To solve this problem, we need to use the flow curve equation, which is given by:

\[
\sigma = K \epsilon^n
\]

where:
- \(\sigma\) is the true stress,
- \(K\) is the strength coefficient,
- \(\epsilon\) is the true strain,
- \(n\) is the strain-hardening exponent.

Given:
- \(K = 600 \, \text{MPa}\)
- \(n = 0.3\)

We need to determine:
(a) The flow stress at a true strain \(\epsilon = 1.0\).
(b) The true strain at a flow stress \(\sigma = 600 \, \text{MPa}\).

### (a) Flow stress at a true strain \(\epsilon = 1.0\)

Using the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = K \epsilon^n
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
\sigma = 600 \times (1.0)^{0.3}
\]

Since any number raised to the power of 1 is itself, we have:

\[
\sigma = 600 \times 1 = 600 \, \text{MPa}
\]

Thus, the flow stress at a true strain of 1.0 is \(600 \, \text{MPa}\).

### (b) True strain at a flow stress \(\sigma = 600 \, \text{MPa}\)

Again, using the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = K \epsilon^n
\]

We need to solve for \(\epsilon\) when \(\sigma = 600 \, \text{MPa}\):

\[
600 = 600 \epsilon^{0.3}
\]

Divide both sides by 600:

\[
1 = \epsilon^{0.3}
\]

To solve for \(\epsilon\), raise both sides to the power of \(\frac{1}{0.3}\):

\[
\epsilon = 1^{\frac{1}{0.3}} = 1
\]

Thus, the true strain at a flow stress of \(600 \, \text{MPa}\) is \(1.0\).

In summary:
- (a) The flow stress at a true strain of 1.0 is \(600 \, \text{MPa}\).
- (b) The true strain at a flow stress of \(600 \, \text{MPa}\) is \(1.0\).","Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.

FIGURE 3.5  True stress–strain  curve plotted on log–log scale.  

Because it is a straight line in this transformation of the data, the relationship  between true stress and true strain in the plastic region can be expressed as  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

This equation is called the  ﬂ  ow curve , and it provides a good approximation of the  behavior of metals in the plastic region, including their capacity for strain hardening.  The constant $K$  is called the  strength coefﬁ  cient , MPa  $(1{\mathrm{b}}/{\mathrm{in}}^{2}),$  and it equals the value  of true stress at a true strain value equal to one. The parameter  $n$  is called the  strain  hardening exponent , and it is the slope of the line in Figure 3.5. Its value is directly  related to a metal’s tendency to work harden. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for selected  metals are given in Table 3.4.

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine the strength coefﬁ  cient and  strain hardening exponent in the ﬂ  ow curve equation: $\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}$ .  

Solution:  We have two points on the ﬂ  ow curve from which the ﬂ  ow curve  parameters can be determined: (1) at the yield point and (2) at the maximum  load.  

(1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ .",/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt,[ 0 . 9 0 1 2 2 1 2 4 1 1 0 6 6 7 5 3 ],3.0,3.08
"The flow curve for a certain metal has a strain-hardening exponent of 0.22 and strength coefficient of 54,000 lb/in2. Determine (a) the flow stress at a true strain = 0.45 and (b) the true strain at a flow stress = 40,000 lb/in2.","Solution: (a) Yf = 54,000(0.45)^.22 = 45,300 lb/in2 (b) H = (40,000/54,000)^(1/.22) = (0.7407)^4.545 = 0.256","To solve the given problem, we will use the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = K \epsilon^n
\]

where:
- \(\sigma\) is the flow stress,
- \(K\) is the strength coefficient,
- \(\epsilon\) is the true strain, and
- \(n\) is the strain-hardening exponent.

Given:
- \(K = 54,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2\),
- \(n = 0.22\).

### (a) Determine the flow stress at a true strain \(\epsilon = 0.45\).

Substitute the given values into the flow curve equation:

\[
\sigma = 54,000 \times (0.45)^{0.22}
\]

First, calculate \((0.45)^{0.22}\):

\[
0.45^{0.22} \approx 0.782
\]

Now, calculate the flow stress \(\sigma\):

\[
\sigma = 54,000 \times 0.782 \approx 42,228 \, \text{lb/in}^2
\]

So, the flow stress at a true strain of 0.45 is approximately \(42,228 \, \text{lb/in}^2\).

### (b) Determine the true strain at a flow stress \(\sigma = 40,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2\).

Rearrange the flow curve equation to solve for \(\epsilon\):

\[
40,000 = 54,000 \times \epsilon^{0.22}
\]

Divide both sides by 54,000:

\[
\epsilon^{0.22} = \frac{40,000}{54,000} \approx 0.7407
\]

Now, solve for \(\epsilon\) by raising both sides to the power of \(\frac{1}{0.22}\):

\[
\epsilon = (0.7407)^{\frac{1}{0.22}}
\]

Calculate \((0.7407)^{\frac{1}{0.22}}\):

\[
\epsilon \approx 0.365
\]

So, the true strain at a flow stress of \(40,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2\) is approximately \(0.365\).

In summary:
- (a) The flow stress at a true strain of 0.45 is approximately \(42,228 \, \text{lb/in}^2\).
- (b) The true strain at a flow stress of \(40,000 \, \text{lb/in}^2\) is approximately \(0.365\).","The typical stress–strain relationship for a metal exhibits elasticity below the  yield point and strain hardening above it. Figures 3.4 and 3.5 indicate this behavior  in linear and logarithmic axes. In the plastic region, the metal’s behavior is expressed  by the ﬂ  ow curve:  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

where $K=$  the strength coefﬁ  cient, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ; and $n$  is the strain hardening expo- nent. The stress  $\sigma$  and strain  $\epsilon$  in the ﬂ  ow curve are true stress and true strain. The  ﬂ  ow curve is generally valid as a relationship that deﬁ  nes a metal’s plastic behavior  in cold working. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for different metals at room temperature  are listed in Table 3.4.  

Flow Stress  The ﬂ  ow curve describes the stress–strain relationship in the region  in which metal forming takes place. It indicates the ﬂ  ow stress of the metal—the  strength property that determines forces and power required to accomplish a par- ticular forming operation. For most metals at room temperature, the stress–strain  plot of Figure 3.5 indicates that as the metal is deformed, its strength increases  due to strain hardening. The stress required to continue deformation must be  increased to match this increase in strength.  Flow stress  is deﬁ  ned as the instan- taneous value of stress required to continue deforming the material—to keep the  metal “ﬂ  owing.” It is the yield strength of the metal as a function of strain, which  can be expressed:  

$$
Y_{f}=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

where  $Y_{f}=$  ﬂ  ow stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ .  

In the individual forming operations discussed in the following two chapters, the  instantaneous ﬂ  ow stress can be used to analyze the process as it is occurring. For  example, in certain forging operations, the instantaneous force during compression  can be determined from the ﬂ  ow stress value. Maximum force can be calculated  based on the ﬂ  ow stress that results from the ﬁ  nal strain at the end of the forging  stroke.  

In other cases, the analysis is based on the average stresses and strains that occur  during deformation rather than instantaneous values. Extrusion represents this case,  Figure 17.2(c). As the billet is reduced in cross section to pass through the extrusion  die opening, the metal gradually strain hardens to reach a maximum value. Rather  than determine a sequence of instantaneous stress–strain values during the reduc- tion, which would be not only difﬁ  cult but also of limited interest, it is more useful to  analyze the process based on the average ﬂ  ow stress during deformation.  

Average Flow Stress  The average ﬂ  ow stress (also called the  mean ﬂ  ow stress ) is  the average value of stress over the stress–strain curve from the beginning of strain  to the ﬁ  nal (maximum) value that occurs during deformation. The value is illustrated  in the stress–strain plot of Figure 17.4. The average ﬂ  ow stress is determined by inte- grating the ﬂ  ow curve equation, Equation (17.1), between zero and the ﬁ  nal strain  value deﬁ  ning the range of interest. This yields the equation:

"Derive an expression for true strain as a function of D and Do for a tensile test specimen of round cross section, where D = the instantaneous diameter of the specimen and Do is its original diameter.","Solution: Starting with the definition of true strain as H = ln(L/Lo) and assuming constant volume, we have V = AoLo = AL Therefore, L/Lo = Ao/A       A =pi D^2 and Ao =pi Do^2 and A0=piD^2        Ao/A = piDo^2/piD^2 = (Do/D)2 H = ln(Do/D)2 = 2ln(Do/D)","To derive an expression for true strain as a function of the instantaneous diameter \( D \) and the original diameter \( D_o \) for a tensile test specimen of round cross-section, we need to consider the relationship between the cross-sectional area and the diameter of the specimen.

### Step-by-Step Derivation:

1. **Understand the Relationship Between Diameter and Area:**
   - For a round cross-section, the area \( A \) is related to the diameter \( D \) by the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}
     \]
   - Similarly, the original area \( A_o \) is:
     \[
     A_o = \frac{\pi D_o^2}{4}
     \]

2. **Express True Strain in Terms of Area:**
   - True strain (\( \epsilon_t \)) is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the instantaneous length to the original length. However, for a round specimen, we can relate this to the change in cross-sectional area due to volume constancy (assuming incompressibility during plastic deformation):
     \[
     \epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{A_o}{A}\right)
     \]

3. **Substitute the Area Expressions:**
   - Substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( A_o \) into the true strain formula:
     \[
     \epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{\frac{\pi D_o^2}{4}}{\frac{\pi D^2}{4}}\right)
     \]

4. **Simplify the Expression:**
   - The \(\pi/4\) terms cancel out, simplifying the expression to:
     \[
     \epsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{D_o^2}{D^2}\right)
     \]

5. **Apply Logarithmic Identity:**
   - Use the logarithmic identity \(\ln(a^b) = b \ln(a)\) to further simplify:
     \[
     \epsilon_t = 2 \ln\left(\frac{D_o}{D}\right)
     \]

### Final Expression:
The true strain (\( \epsilon_t \)) as a function of the instantaneous diameter \( D \) and the original diameter \( D_o \) for a tensile test specimen of round cross-section is given by:
\[
\epsilon_t = 2 \ln\left(\frac{D_o}{D}\right)
\]

This expression captures the true strain based on the change in diameter, reflecting the material's deformation during the tensile test.","To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

metallic test specimens and the associated nonuniform effect on elongation and area  reduction. Despite these difﬁ  culties, percent elongation and percent area reduction  are the most commonly used measures of ductility in engineering practice.

# Example 3.1  Engineering  stress and strain  

A tensile test specimen has a starting gage length $=50\:\mathrm{mm}$  and a cross-sectional  area $=200\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ . During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ .

"Show that true strain H = ln(1 + e), where e = engineering strain.","Solution: Starting definitions: (1) H = ln(L/Lo) and (2) e = (L -Lo)/Lo Consider definition (2): e = L/Lo -Lo/Lo = L/Lo -1 Rearranging, 1 + e = L/Lo Substituting this into definition (1), H = ln(1 + e)","To demonstrate that true strain \( \epsilon = \ln(1 + e) \), where \( e \) is the engineering strain, we need to understand the definitions of both true strain and engineering strain.

### Definitions:

1. **Engineering Strain (\( e \))**: This is defined as the change in length divided by the original length. Mathematically, it is expressed as:
   \[
   e = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0} = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0}
   \]
   where \( L \) is the final length and \( L_0 \) is the original length.

2. **True Strain (\( \epsilon \))**: This is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the final length to the original length. Mathematically, it is expressed as:
   \[
   \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right)
   \]

### Derivation:

To show that \( \epsilon = \ln(1 + e) \), we start by substituting the expression for engineering strain into the formula for true strain.

1. From the definition of engineering strain:
   \[
   e = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0}
   \]

2. Rearrange this equation to express \( L \) in terms of \( L_0 \) and \( e \):
   \[
   L = L_0(1 + e)
   \]

3. Substitute this expression for \( L \) into the formula for true strain:
   \[
   \epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{L_0(1 + e)}{L_0}\right)
   \]

4. Simplify the expression:
   \[
   \epsilon = \ln(1 + e)
   \]

Thus, we have shown that the true strain \( \epsilon \) is indeed equal to \( \ln(1 + e) \), where \( e \) is the engineering strain. This relationship is particularly useful in the plastic region of deformation, where the true strain accounts for the continuous change in the material's dimensions.","In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation.

previous curve, a downturn ﬁ  nally occurs as a result of necking. A dashed line is used  in the ﬁ  gure to indicate the projected continuation of the true stress–strain plot if  necking had not occurred.  

As strain becomes signiﬁ  cant in the plastic region, the values of true strain and  engineering strain diverge. True strain can be related to the corresponding engineer- ing strain by  

$$
\epsilon=\ln(1+e)
$$  

Similarly, true stress and engineering stress can be related by the expression  

$$
\sigma=s\,(1\,+\,e)
$$  

In Figure 3.4, note that stress increases continuously in the plastic region until  necking begins. When this happened in the engineering stress–strain curve, its sig- niﬁ  cance was lost because an admittedly erroneous area value was used to calculate  stress. Now when the true stress also increases, it cannot be dismissed so lightly.  What it means is that the metal is becoming stronger as strain increases. This is the  property called  strain hardening  that was mentioned in the previous chapter in the  discussion of metallic crystal structures, and it is a property that most metals exhibit  to a greater or lesser degree.  

# Example 3.2  True stress and  strain  

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine (a) true stress and (b) true strain  at the maximum load of  $65{,}000\:\mathrm{N}.$ .  

Solution:  (a) True stress is deﬁ  ned as the load divided by the instantaneous  area. To ﬁ  nd the instantaneous area, we assume uniform elongation prior to  necking. Thus, $A L=A_{o}L_{o}$ , and $A=A_{o}L_{o}/L=200(50)/57.7=173.3\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}/$  

$$
{\sigma=F/A=65,\!000/173.3=375\;\mathrm{MPa}}
$$  

(b) By Equation (3.7), true strain $\epsilon=\ln(L/L_{o})=\ln(57.7/50)=$ $\ln(1.154)={\bf0.143}$ .  

Check:  Use Equations (3.8) and (3.9) to check these values:  

Using Equation (3.8) and the value of  $e$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\epsilon=\ln(1+0.154)=0.143$ .  

Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.

A copper wire of diameter 0.80 mm fails at an engineering stress = 248.2 MPa. Its ductility is measured as 75% reduction of area. Determine the true stress and true strain at failure.,"Solution: Area reduction AR = (Ao -Af)/Ao = 0.75 Ao -Af = 0.75 Ao    Ao -0.75Ao = 0.25 Ao = Af      If engineering stress = 248.2 MPa, then true stress V = 248.2/0.25 = 992.8 MPa True strain H = ln(Lf/Lo) = ln(Ao/Af) = ln(4) = 1.386.  However, it should be noted that these values are associated with the necked portion of the test specimen.","To determine the true stress and true strain at failure for the copper wire, we need to use the definitions of true stress and true strain. Let's go through the calculations step by step.

### Given:
- Diameter of the wire, \( d = 0.80 \, \text{mm} \)
- Engineering stress at failure, \( \sigma_{\text{eng}} = 248.2 \, \text{MPa} \)
- Ductility (reduction of area), \( \text{RA} = 75\% \)

### (1) Calculate the initial cross-sectional area:
The initial cross-sectional area \( A_0 \) of the wire can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle:
\[
A_0 = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}
\]
Substituting the given diameter:
\[
A_0 = \frac{\pi (0.80)^2}{4} = \frac{\pi \times 0.64}{4} \approx 0.5024 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

### (2) Calculate the final cross-sectional area:
The reduction of area is given as 75%, which means the final area \( A_f \) is 25% of the initial area:
\[
A_f = A_0 \times (1 - \text{RA}) = 0.5024 \times 0.25 = 0.1256 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

### (3) Calculate the true stress at failure:
True stress \( \sigma_{\text{true}} \) is calculated using the actual (instantaneous) area at failure:
\[
\sigma_{\text{true}} = \frac{F}{A_f}
\]
We know the engineering stress is given by:
\[
\sigma_{\text{eng}} = \frac{F}{A_0}
\]
Thus, the force \( F \) can be expressed as:
\[
F = \sigma_{\text{eng}} \times A_0 = 248.2 \times 0.5024 = 124.67 \, \text{N}
\]
Now, substituting \( F \) and \( A_f \) into the true stress formula:
\[
\sigma_{\text{true}} = \frac{124.67}{0.1256} \approx 992.5 \, \text{MPa}
\]

### (4) Calculate the true strain at failure:
True strain \( \epsilon_{\text{true}} \) is given by:
\[
\epsilon_{\text{true}} = \ln \left( \frac{A_0}{A_f} \right)
\]
Substituting the areas:
\[
\epsilon_{\text{true}} = \ln \left( \frac{0.5024}{0.1256} \right) = \ln (4) \approx 1.386
\]

### Conclusion:
- **True Stress at Failure:** \( \sigma_{\text{true}} \approx 992.5 \, \text{MPa} \)
- **True Strain at Failure:** \( \epsilon_{\text{true}} \approx 1.386 \)

These calculations provide the true stress and true strain at the point of failure for the copper wire, considering the reduction in area due to ductility.","During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ .

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation.

Let's break down the solution step by step:

### Given Data:
- **Starting gage length, \( L_0 \)**: 2.0 inches
- **Cross-sectional area, \( A_0 \)**: 0.5 in²
- **Maximum load, \( F \)**: 37,000 lb
- **Elongation at maximum load**: 24%

### (1) Calculate the True Stress:

True stress is calculated using the formula:

\[
\sigma = \frac{F}{A}
\]

However, true stress uses the instantaneous area, which is not directly given. We need to find the new area after elongation. First, let's calculate the engineering stress using the original area:

\[
\sigma_{\text{eng}} = \frac{F}{A_0} = \frac{37,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.5 \, \text{in}^2} = 74,000 \, \text{psi}
\]

To find the true stress, we need to account for the reduction in area due to elongation. Assuming volume constancy (which is a common assumption for metals under plastic deformation), the initial volume equals the final volume:

\[
A_0 \cdot L_0 = A \cdot L
\]

Given the elongation is 24%, the final length \( L \) is:

\[
L = L_0 \times (1 + \text{elongation}) = 2.0 \, \text{in} \times 1.24 = 2.48 \, \text{in}
\]

Using the volume constancy:

\[
A = \frac{A_0 \cdot L_0}{L} = \frac{0.5 \, \text{in}^2 \times 2.0 \, \text{in}}{2.48 \, \text{in}} = 0.4032 \, \text{in}^2
\]

Now, calculate the true stress:

\[
\sigma = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{37,000 \, \text{lb}}{0.4032 \, \text{in}^2} \approx 91,750 \, \text{psi}
\]

### (2) Calculate the True Strain:

True strain is calculated using the formula:

\[
\epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right)
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\epsilon = \ln\left(\frac{2.48 \, \text{in}}{2.0 \, \text{in}}\right) = \ln(1.24) \approx 0.215
\]

### Conclusion:

- **True Stress**: Approximately 91,750 psi
- **True Strain**: Approximately 0.215

- \( T R S \) is the transverse rupture strength, given as 1000 MPa.
- \( F \) is the applied load at fracture, which we need to find.
- \( L \) is the length of the specimen between supports, given as 60 mm.
- \( b \) is the width of the specimen, given as 15 mm.

load. These materials do not respond well to traditional tensile testing because of  problems in preparing the test specimens and possible misalignment of the press  jaws that hold the specimen. The  bending test  (also known as the  ﬂ  exure test ) is  used to test the strength of these materials, using a setup illustrated in the ﬁ  rst  diagram in Figure 3.10. In this procedure, a specimen of rectangular cross section  is positioned between two supports, and a load is applied at its center. In this con- ﬁ  guration, the test is called a three-point bending test. A four-point conﬁ  guration  is also sometimes used. These brittle materials do not ﬂ  ex to the exaggerated ex- tent shown in Figure 3.10; instead they deform elastically until immediately be- fore fracture. Failure usually occurs because the ultimate tensile strength of the  outer ﬁ  bers of the specimen has been exceeded. This results in  cleavage , a failure  mode associated with ceramics and metals operating at low service temperatures,  in which separation rather than slip occurs along certain crystallographic planes.  The strength value derived from this test is called the  transverse rupture strength ,  calculated from the formula  

$$
T R S={\frac{1.5F L}{b t^{2}}}
$$  

where  $T R S=$  transverse rupture strength, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  applied load at fracture,  N (lb); $L=$ length of the specimen between supports, mm (in); and  $b$  and  $t$  are the  dimensions of the cross section of the specimen as shown in the ﬁ  gure, mm (in).  

The ﬂ  exure test is also used for certain nonbrittle materials such as thermoplastic  polymers. In this case, because the material is likely to deform rather than fracture,  TRS cannot be determined based on failure of the specimen. Instead, either of two  measures is used: (1) the load recorded at a given level of deﬂ  ection, or (2) the de- ﬂ  ection observed at a given load.

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12.

1. **Calculate \( t^2 \):**

   \[
   t^2 = (0.25 \, \text{in})^2 = 0.0625 \, \text{in}^2
   \]

2. **Substitute the values into the TRS formula:**

   \[
   TRS = \frac{1.5 \times 1700 \, \text{lb} \times 2.0 \, \text{in}}{0.50 \, \text{in} \times 0.0625 \, \text{in}^2}
   \]

3. **Calculate the numerator:**

   \[
   1.5 \times 1700 \times 2.0 = 5100 \, \text{lb} \cdot \text{in}
   \]

4. **Calculate the denominator:**

   \[
   0.50 \times 0.0625 = 0.03125 \, \text{in}^3
   \]

5. **Calculate the TRS:**

   \[
   TRS = \frac{5100}{0.03125} = 163200 \, \text{lb/in}^2
   \]

Therefore, the transverse rupture strength of the ceramic specimen is \( 163200 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \).","[](images/4fa9287e7e474f4387d790a053742a087536a2b5fe6d46af83a3ed15bed0f89e.jpg)

load. These materials do not respond well to traditional tensile testing because of  problems in preparing the test specimens and possible misalignment of the press  jaws that hold the specimen. The  bending test  (also known as the  ﬂ  exure test ) is  used to test the strength of these materials, using a setup illustrated in the ﬁ  rst  diagram in Figure 3.10. In this procedure, a specimen of rectangular cross section  is positioned between two supports, and a load is applied at its center. In this con- ﬁ  guration, the test is called a three-point bending test. A four-point conﬁ  guration  is also sometimes used. These brittle materials do not ﬂ  ex to the exaggerated ex- tent shown in Figure 3.10; instead they deform elastically until immediately be- fore fracture. Failure usually occurs because the ultimate tensile strength of the  outer ﬁ  bers of the specimen has been exceeded. This results in  cleavage , a failure  mode associated with ceramics and metals operating at low service temperatures,  in which separation rather than slip occurs along certain crystallographic planes.  The strength value derived from this test is called the  transverse rupture strength ,  calculated from the formula  

$$
T R S={\frac{1.5F L}{b t^{2}}}
$$  

where  $T R S=$  transverse rupture strength, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  applied load at fracture,  N (lb); $L=$ length of the specimen between supports, mm (in); and  $b$  and  $t$  are the  dimensions of the cross section of the specimen as shown in the ﬁ  gure, mm (in).  

The ﬂ  exure test is also used for certain nonbrittle materials such as thermoplastic  polymers. In this case, because the material is likely to deform rather than fracture,  TRS cannot be determined based on failure of the specimen. Instead, either of two  measures is used: (1) the load recorded at a given level of deﬂ  ection, or (2) the de- ﬂ  ection observed at a given load.  

# 3.1.4 SHEAR PROPERTIES  

Shear involves application of stresses in opposite directions on either side of a thin  element to deﬂ  ect it as shown in Figure 3.11. The shear stress is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\tau={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

![](images/54903b7bc86140704dc9a1b301a1623b6698845dbec06069b59ac3b86084a573.jpg)  

where  $\tau=$  shear stress,  $\mathrm{lb/in^{2}}$  (MPa);  $F=$  applied force,  $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A=$  area over  which the force is applied, $\mathrm{in}^{2}\left(\mathrm{mm}^{2}\right)$ . Shear strain can be deﬁ  ned as  

$$

where  $\gamma=$  shear strain, $\mathrm{mm/mm}\;(\mathrm{in/in});\delta=$ the deﬂ  ection of the element, mm (in);  and $b=$  the orthogonal distance over which deﬂ  ection occurs, mm (in).  

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12. As torque  is increased, the tube deﬂ  ects by twisting, which is a shear strain for this geometry.",/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec3.txt,[ 0 . 8 4 5 4 1 1 7 0 3 6 1 5 8 4 6 8 ],3.0,3.22

### Given Data:
- Radius, \( R = 25 \) mm
- Wall thickness, \( t = 3 \) mm
- Gauge length, \( L = 50 \) mm
- Applied torque, \( T = 900 \) N-m (Note: 1 N-m = 1000 N-mm)
- Angular deflection, \( \alpha = 0.3 \) radians

### (a) Calculate the Shear Stress (\(\tau\)):

The formula for shear stress in a torsion test is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{T}{2\pi R^2 t}
\]

First, convert the torque from N-m to N-mm:

\[
T = 900 \, \text{N-m} = 900 \times 1000 \, \text{N-mm} = 900,000 \, \text{N-mm}
\]

Now, substitute the values into the shear stress formula:

\[
\tau = \frac{900,000}{2\pi (25)^2 (3)}
\]

Calculate the denominator:

\[
2\pi (25)^2 (3) = 2 \times 3.1416 \times 625 \times 3 = 11,781.6
\]

Now, calculate the shear stress:

\[
\tau = \frac{900,000}{11,781.6} \approx 76.39 \, \text{N/mm}^2
\]

### (b) Calculate the Shear Strain (\(\gamma\)):

The formula for shear strain in a torsion test is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{R\alpha}{L}
\]

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[
\gamma = \frac{25 \times 0.3}{50}
\]

Calculate the shear strain:

\[
\gamma = \frac{7.5}{50} = 0.15 \, \text{mm/mm}
\]

### Summary:
- **Shear Stress (\(\tau\))**: Approximately \( 76.39 \, \text{N/mm}^2 \)
- **Shear Strain (\(\gamma\))**: \( 0.15 \, \text{mm/mm} \)

These calculations provide the shear stress and shear strain for the given torsion test specimen based on the provided data and formulas.","Shear strain can be deﬁ  ned as

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12. As torque  is increased, the tube deﬂ  ects by twisting, which is a shear strain for this geometry. The shear stress can be determined in the test by the equation  

$$
\tau=\frac{T}{2\pi R^{2}t}
$$  

where  $T=$  applied torque,  $\mathrm{N{-mm}}$  (lb-in);  $R\,=$ radius of the tube measured to the  neutral axis of the wall, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and $t=$  wall thickness, mm (in). The shear strain can  be determined by measuring the amount of angular deﬂ  ection of the tube, convert- ing this into a distance deﬂ  ected, and dividing by the gauge length  $L$ . Reducing this  to a simple expression,  

$$
\gamma={\frac{R\alpha}{L}}
$$

In the plastic region of the shear stress–strain curve, the material strain hardens  to cause the applied torque to continue to increase until fracture ﬁ  nally   occurs.  The relationship in this region is similar to the ﬂ  ow curve. The shear stress at  fracture can be calculated and this is used as the  shear strength $S$  of the material.  Shear strength can be estimated from tensile strength data by the approximation:  $S=0.7(T S)$ .  

Because the cross-sectional area of the test specimen in the torsion test does not  change as it does in the tensile and compression tests, the engineering stress–strain  curve for shear derived from the torsion test is virtually the same as the true stress– strain curve.  

Shear processes are common in industry. Shearing action is used to cut sheet metal  in blanking, punching, and other cutting operations (Section 19.1). In machining, the  material is removed by the mechanism of shear deformation (Section 20.2).  

The hardness of a material is deﬁ  ned as its resistance to permanent indentation.  Good hardness generally means that the material is resistant to scratching and wear.  For many engineering applications, including most of the tooling used in manufac- turing, scratch and wear resistance are important characteristics. As the reader shall  see later in this section, there is a strong correlation between hardness and strength.

The density of a material changes with temperature due to thermal expansion, and this can be calculated using the coefficient of thermal expansion.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Identify the Coefficient of Thermal Expansion:**
   - The coefficient of linear thermal expansion (\(\alpha\)) for aluminum is typically around \(23 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{°C}^{-1}\). This value might be found in Table 4.1 or a similar reference table.

2. **Calculate the Change in Temperature:**
   - \(\Delta T = 650^\circ\text{C} - 20^\circ\text{C} = 630^\circ\text{C}\)

3. **Calculate the Linear Expansion:**
   - The linear expansion factor can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Expansion Factor} = 1 + \alpha \times \Delta T
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Expansion Factor} = 1 + (23 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{°C}^{-1}) \times 630^\circ\text{C} = 1 + 0.01449 = 1.01449
     \]

4. **Calculate the Volume Expansion:**
   - Since volume expansion is approximately three times the linear expansion for isotropic materials, the volume expansion factor is:
     \[
     \text{Volume Expansion Factor} = (\text{Expansion Factor})^3 = (1.01449)^3 \approx 1.0438
     \]

5. **Calculate the New Density:**
   - The density of a material is inversely proportional to its volume. Therefore, the new density (\(\rho_{\text{new}}\)) can be calculated as:
     \[
     \rho_{\text{new}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{original}}}{\text{Volume Expansion Factor}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \rho_{\text{new}} = \frac{2.70 \, \text{g/cm}^3}{1.0438} \approx 2.585 \, \text{g/cm}^3
     \]

### Conclusion:
The density of aluminum at 650°C is approximately \(2.585 \, \text{g/cm}^3\). This calculation accounts for the thermal expansion of aluminum as it is heated from room temperature to 650°C.","# TABLE  •  6.1   (continued): (f) Titanium.

as an ore because of its higher Ti content. In recovery of the metal from its ores, the  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  is converted to titanium tetrachloride  $\mathrm{(TiCl_{4})}$  by reacting the compound with  chlorine gas. This is followed by a sequence of distillation steps to remove impurities.  The  highly concentrated  $\mathrm{TiCl_{4}}$  is then reduced to metallic titanium by reaction with  magnesium; this is known as the  Kroll process . Sodium can also be used as a reduc-  ing agent. In either case, an inert atmosphere must be maintained to prevent $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ , $\mathbf{N}_{2}$ ,  or $\mathrm{H}_{2}$  from contaminating the Ti, owing to its chemical affinity for these gases. The  resulting metal is used to cast ingots of titanium and its alloys.  

Properties of Titanium  Ti’s coefficient of thermal expansion is relatively low  among metals. It is stiffer and stronger than aluminum, and it retains good strength  at elevated temperatures. Pure titanium is reactive, which presents problems in  processing, especially in the molten state. However, at room temperature it forms  a thin adherent oxide coating $\left(\mathrm{TiO}_{2}\right)$  that provides excellent corrosion resistance.  

These properties give rise to two principal application areas for titanium: (1) in  the commercially pure state, Ti is used for corrosion resistant components, such as  marine components and prosthetic implants; and (2) titanium alloys are used as  high-strength components in temperatures ranging from ambient to above  $550^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ $(1000^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ), especially where its excellent strength-to-weight ratio is exploited. These  latter applications include aircraft and missile components. Some of the alloying  elements used with titanium include aluminum, manganese, tin, and vanadium.  Some compositions and mechanical properties for several alloys are presented in  Table 6.13.

"With reference to Table 4.1, determine the increase in length of a steel bar whose length = 10.0 in, if the bar is heated from room temperature of 70F to 500F.",Solution: Increase = (6.7 x 10^-6 in/in/F)(10.0 in)(500F -70F) = 0.0288 in.,"To determine the increase in length of a steel bar when it is heated from 70°F to 500°F, we will use the formula for linear thermal expansion:

\[
L_{2} - L_{1} = a \cdot L_{1} \cdot (T_{2} - T_{1})
\]

where:
- \( L_{1} \) is the initial length of the bar.
- \( L_{2} \) is the final length of the bar.
- \( a \) is the coefficient of thermal expansion.
- \( T_{1} \) is the initial temperature.
- \( T_{2} \) is the final temperature.

Given:
- \( L_{1} = 10.0 \) inches
- \( T_{1} = 70^\circ \text{F} \)
- \( T_{2} = 500^\circ \text{F} \)

We need to find the coefficient of thermal expansion (\( a \)) for steel from Table 4.1. Since the table is not provided here, let's assume a typical value for the coefficient of thermal expansion for steel, which is approximately \( 6.5 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{in/in/°F} \).

Now, substitute the values into the formula:

1. Calculate the temperature change:
   \[
   T_{2} - T_{1} = 500^\circ \text{F} - 70^\circ \text{F} = 430^\circ \text{F}
   \]

2. Substitute the values into the thermal expansion formula:
   \[
   L_{2} - L_{1} = 6.5 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{in/in/°F} \times 10.0 \, \text{in} \times 430^\circ \text{F}
   \]

3. Perform the multiplication:
   \[
   L_{2} - L_{1} = 6.5 \times 10^{-6} \times 10.0 \times 430
   \]

4. Calculate the result:
   \[
   L_{2} - L_{1} = 6.5 \times 10^{-6} \times 4300 = 0.02795 \, \text{in}
   \]

Therefore, the increase in length of the steel bar is approximately 0.028 inches.","The change in  length corresponding to a given temperature change is given by:  

$$
L_{2}-L_{1}=a L_{1}\left(T_{2}-T_{1}\right)
$$  

where $a=$   coefficient of thermal expansion, $^{\circ}\mathbf{C}^{\cdot1}(^{\circ}\mathbf{F}^{\cdot1})$ ; and $L_{1}$  and $L_{2}$  are lengths,  mm (in), corresponding, respectively, to temperatures $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2},\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\ (^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ .  

Values of coefficient of thermal expansion given in Table 4.1 suggest that it has  a linear relationship with temperature. This is only an approximation. Not only is  length affected by temperature, but the thermal expansion coefficient itself is also  affected. For some materials it increases with temperature; for other materials it  decreases. These changes are usually not significant enough to be of much concern,  and values like those in the table are quite useful in design calculations for the range  of temperatures contemplated in service. Changes in the coefficient are more sub-  stantial when the metal undergoes a phase transformation, such as from solid to  liquid, or from one crystal structure to another.  

In manufacturing operations, thermal expansion is put to good use in shrink fit  and expansion fit assemblies (Section 31.3), in which a part is heated to increase its  size or cooled to decrease its size to permit insertion into some other part. When the  part returns to ambient temperature, a tightly fitted assembly is obtained. Thermal  expansion can be a problem in heat treatment (Chapter 26) and welding (Section  29.6) because of thermal stresses that develop in the material during these processes.  

# 4.1.3  MELTING  CHARACTERISTICS  

For a pure element, the  melting point $T_{m}$   is the temperature at which the mate- rial  transforms from solid to liquid state. The reverse transformation, from liquid to  solid,  occurs at the same temperature and is called the  freezing point . For crystalline  elements,  such as metals, the melting and freezing temperatures are the same. A cer- tain  amount of heat energy, called the  heat of fusion , is required at this temperature to  accomplish the transformation from solid to liquid.  

Melting of a metal element at a specific temperature assumes equilibrium condi-  tions. Exceptions occur in nature; for example, when a molten metal is cooled, it may  remain in the liquid state below its freezing point if nucleation of crystals does not  initiate immediately. When this happens, the liquid is said to be  supercooled .  

There are other variations in the melting process—differences in the way melt-  ing occurs in different materials. For example, unlike pure metals, most metal alloys  do not have a single melting point. Instead, melting begins at a certain temperature,   called the  solidus , and continues as   the temperature increases until finally convert-  ing completely to the liquid state at a temperature called the  liquidus . Between the  two temperatures, the alloy is a mixture of solid and molten metals, the amounts of  each being inversely proportional to their relative distances from the liquidus and  solidus. Although most alloys behave in this way, exceptions are eutectic alloys that

melt (and freeze) at a single temperature. These issues are examined in the discus-  sion of phase diagrams in Chapter 6.  

Another difference in melting occurs with noncrystalline materials (glasses). In  these materials, there is a gradual transition from solid to liquid states. The solid  material gradually softens as temperature increases, finally becoming liquid at the  melting point. During softening, the material has a consistency of increasing plasticity  (increasingly like a fluid) as it gets closer to the melting point.  

These differences in melting characteristics among pure metals, alloys, and glass  are portrayed in Figure 4.1.",/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec12456.txt,[ 0 . 8 2 4 5 4 6 4 7 9 0 8 7 2 8 3 6 ],4.0,4.4

\[ 
Q = m \cdot C_s \cdot \Delta T 
\]

where:
- \( Q \) is the heat required (in Joules),
- \( m \) is the mass of the aluminum block (in grams),
- \( C_s \) is the specific heat capacity of aluminum (in J/g°C),
- \( \Delta T \) is the change in temperature (in °C).

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate the Volume of the Aluminum Block:**
   The block is a cube with dimensions 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm.
   \[
   V = 10 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} \times 10 \, \text{cm} = 1000 \, \text{cm}^3

2. **Determine the Density of Aluminum:**
   The density of aluminum is approximately \( 2.7 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \).

3. **Calculate the Mass of the Aluminum Block:**
   \[
   m = \text{density} \times \text{volume} = 2.7 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \times 1000 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2700 \, \text{g}
   \]

4. **Determine the Specific Heat Capacity of Aluminum:**
   The specific heat capacity of aluminum is approximately \( 0.897 \, \text{J/g°C} \).

5. **Calculate the Change in Temperature (\( \Delta T \)):**
   \[
   \Delta T = 300°C - 21°C = 279°C
   \]

6. **Calculate the Heat Required (\( Q \)):**
   \[
   Q = m \cdot C_s \cdot \Delta T = 2700 \, \text{g} \times 0.897 \, \text{J/g°C} \times 279°C
   \]
   \[
   Q = 2700 \times 0.897 \times 279 = 676,779.3 \, \text{J}
   \]

Therefore, the quantity of heat required to increase the temperature of the aluminum block from 21°C to 300°C is approximately \( 676,779.3 \, \text{J} \).","In permanent metal molds, small vent holes are drilled into the mold or  machined into the parting line to permit removal of air and gases.  

#  Heating and Pouring  

To perform a casting operation, the metal must be heated to a temperature some- what above its melting point and then poured into the mold cavity to solidify. Several  aspects of these two steps are discussed in this section.  

# 10.2.1  HEATING THE METAL  

Heating furnaces of various kinds (Section 11.4.1) are used to heat the metal to a  molten temperature sufﬁ  cient for casting. The heat energy required is the sum of (1)  the heat to raise the temperature to the melting point, (2) the heat of fusion to con- vert it from solid to liquid, and (3) the heat to raise the molten metal to the desired  temperature for pouring. This can be expressed:  

$$
H=\rho\,V\{C_{s}\,(T_{m}-\,T_{o})+\,H_{f}+\,C_{l}\,(T_{p}\,-\,T_{m})\}
$$  

where  $H=$  total heat required to raise the temperature of the metal to the pour- ing temperature, J (Btu); $\rho=$  density,  $\mathrm{{g}/\mathrm{{cm}}^{3}}$   $\left(1\mathrm{b}\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{in}^{3}\right)$ ;  $C_{s}=$  weight speciﬁ  c heat for  the solid metal,  $\mathrm{J/g-C}$  (Btu/lbm-F);  $T_{m}=$  melting temperature of the metal, C (F);  $T_{o}=$  starting temperature—usually ambient,  $\mathrm{C}$  (F);  $H_{f}=$  heat of fusion,  $\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{g}$  ( $\mathrm{{'Bup/}}$ lbm);  $C_{1}=$  weight speciﬁ  c heat of the liquid metal, $\mathrm{J/g-C}$  (Btu/lbm-F);  $T_{p}=$  pouring  temperature, C (F); and  $V=$  volume of metal being heated, $\mathrm{cm}^{3}\left(\mathrm{in}^{3}\right)$ .  

# Example 10.1  Heating metal  for casting  

One cubic meter of a certain eutectic alloy is heated in a crucible from room  temperature to $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  above its melting point for casting. The alloy’s density $=$ $7.5\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , melting point $=800^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , speciﬁ  c heat $=0.33\;\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{g}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  in the solid state  and $0.29\,\mathrm{J/g^{\circ}C}$  in the liquid state; and heat of fusion $=160\,\mathrm{J/g}$ . How much heat  energy must be added to accomplish the heating, assuming no losses?  

Solution :  Assume ambient temperature in the foundry $=25^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and that the  density of the liquid and solid states of the metal are the same. Noting that one  $\mathsf{m}^{3}=10^{6}\,\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , and substituting the property values into Equation (10.1),  

$H=(7.5)\,(10^{6})\{0.33(800-25)+160+0.29\,(100)\}=3335(10^{6})\,\mathrm{J}$ The above equation is of conceptual value, but its computational value is limited,  

notwithstanding the calculation in Example 10.1. Use of Equation (10.1) is com- plicated by the following factors: (1) Speciﬁ  c heat and other thermal properties of  a solid metal vary with temperature, especially if the metal undergoes a change of  phase during heating. (2) A metal’s speciﬁ  c heat may be different in the solid and  liquid states.",/Users/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/1Book/3Book_txt_images/sec10.txt,[ 0 . 8 2 6 6 1 0 7 4 0 4 5 3 0 8 6 ],4.0,4.5

\[
R = \rho \frac{L}{A}
\]

where:
- \( R \) is the resistance,
- \( \rho \) is the resistivity of the material,
- \( L \) is the length of the wire,
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the wire.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the given values:**
   - Length of the wire, \( L = 10 \, \text{m} \).
   - Diameter of the wire, \( d = 0.10 \, \text{mm} = 0.10 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \).

2. **Calculate the cross-sectional area \( A \):**
   The wire is cylindrical, so the cross-sectional area \( A \) is given by the formula for the area of a circle:

   \[
   A = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2
   \]

   Substituting the diameter:

   \[
   A = \pi \left(\frac{0.10 \times 10^{-3}}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \left(0.05 \times 10^{-3}\right)^2
   \]

   \[
   A = \pi \times 0.0025 \times 10^{-6} = 7.85 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}^2
   \]

3. **Find the resistivity \( \rho \) of copper:**
   From Table 4.3 (not provided here, but typically known), the resistivity of copper is approximately:

   \[
   \rho = 1.68 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m}
   \]

4. **Calculate the resistance \( R \):**

   \[
   R = \rho \frac{L}{A} = 1.68 \times 10^{-8} \frac{10}{7.85 \times 10^{-9}}
   \]

   \[
   R = 1.68 \times 10^{-8} \times 1.274 \times 10^{9}
   \]

   \[
   R \approx 0.0214 \, \Omega
   \]

Thus, the resistance \( R \) of the copper wire is approximately \( 0.0214 \, \Omega \).","This can be expressed  by the equation

FIGURE 29.12  Resistance welding  (RW), showing the  components in  spot welding, the  predominant process in  the RW group.  

The current used in resistance welding operations is very high (5000–20,000 A,  typically), although voltage is relatively low (usually below  $10\,\mathrm{V}$ ). The duration $t$  of  the current is short in most processes, perhaps lasting 0.1 to  $0.4~\mathrm{s}$  in a typical spot- welding operation.  

The reason why such a high current is used in RW is because (1) the squared term  in Equation (29.3) ampliﬁ  es the effect of current, and (2) the resistance is very low  (around  $0.0001\;\Omega$ ). Resistance in the welding circuit is the sum of (1) resistance of  the electrodes, (2) resistances of the work parts, (3) contact resistances between elec- trodes and work parts, and (4) contact resistance of the faying surfaces. Thus, heat  is generated in all of these regions of electrical resistance. The ideal situation is for  the faying surfaces to be the largest resistance in the sum, because this is the desired  location of the weld. The resistance of the electrodes is minimized by using metals  with very low resistivities, such as copper. Also, the electrodes are often water cooled  to dissipate the heat that is generated there. The work part resistances are a function  of the resistivities of the base metals and the part thicknesses. The contact resist- ances between the electrodes and the parts are determined by the contact areas (i.e.,  size and shape of the electrode) and the condition of the surfaces (e.g., cleanliness  of the work surfaces and scale on the electrode). Finally, the resistance at the faying  surfaces depends on surface ﬁ  nish, cleanliness, contact area, and pressure. No paint,  oil, dirt, or other contaminants should be present to separate the contacting surfaces.  

# Example 29.2  Resistance  welding  

A resistance spot-welding operation performed on two pieces of $2.5\mathrm{-mm}$ -thick  sheet steel uses 12,000 amps for a 0.20-s duration. The electrodes are  $6\,\mathrm{mm}$  in  diameter at the contacting surfaces. Resistance is assumed to be $0.0001\;\Omega$ , and  the resulting weld nugget $6\:\mathrm{mm}$  in diameter and averages $3\:\mathrm{mm}$  in thickness.  The unit melting energy for the metal  $U_{m}=12.0\:\mathrm{J/mm}^{3}$ . What portion of the  heat generated was used to form the weld nugget, and what portion was dis- sipated into the work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air?  

Solution:   The heat generated in the operation is given by Equation (29.3) as.  

$$
H=(12,\!000)^{2}(0.0001)(0.2)=2880\,\mathrm{J}
$$  

The volume of the weld nugget (assumed disc-shaped) is  $\nu=3.0\frac{\pi(6)^{2}}{4}=$ $84.8\;\mathrm{mm}^{3}$ .  

The heat required to melt this volume of metal is  $H w=84.8(12.0)=\mathbf{1018\,J}$ .   The remaining heat,  $\begin{array}{r}{2880{-}1018=1862\;\mathbf{J}}\end{array}$   $(64.7\%$  of the total), is lost into the  work metal, electrodes, and surrounding air.

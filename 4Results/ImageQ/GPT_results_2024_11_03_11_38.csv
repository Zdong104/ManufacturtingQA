Although I can't provide visual figures, I can describe what such a figure might include:

1. **Consumable Electrode**: In processes like MIG (Metal Inert Gas) welding, the consumable electrode is usually a metal wire fed continuously through a welding gun. The wire melts and becomes part of the weld.

2. **Welding Gun/Torch**: This is the tool held by the welder, which directs the electrode to the welding spot. It also channels the protective gas around the welding area.

3. **Power Source**: Supplies the electricity required to produce the arc. This is essential for melting the consumable electrode and the base metals.

4. **Protective Gas Supply**: In MIG and TIG welding, a protective gas (often argon, CO2, or a mixture) shields the weld pool from atmospheric contamination. The gas is stored in a cylinder and regulated to flow through the welding gun.

5. **Workpiece**: The metals that are being joined together by the welding process.

6. **Ground Clamp**: Connected to the workpiece to complete the electrical circuit needed for welding.

A well-drawn figure would typically show these components in a layout representing an operational setup.

   - Each curve corresponds to a different constant temperature.
   - Initially, hardness increases with time as precipitates form and strengthen the alloy.
   - After reaching a peak, further aging can lead to over-aging, where hardness decreases due to coarsening of precipitates.

2. **Hardness vs. Temperature and Time:**
   - Sometimes a 3D plot is used, with the x-axis representing time, y-axis representing temperature, and the z-axis representing hardness.
   - This surface plot helps visualize the combined effect of aging time and temperature on alloy hardness.

These figures essentially show that, generally, higher temperatures initially increase the rate of hardening but also accelerate over-aging. Lower temperatures may result in slower hardening but maintain higher hardness for extended periods.",069208572608804f435085cf0f88f0e670f2d6ba60fe0cea27a83a7c13930388.jpg

This arrangement converts the rotary motion of the motor into linear motion, which is used to precisely position components or tools.

The specific arrangement of the motor and lead screw in an NC positioning system can vary, but a common setup involves:
- A motor (often a stepper or servo motor) connected to one end of the lead screw.
- The lead screw runs through a nut that is attached to the moving part. As the screw rotates, the nut and attached component move linearly along the axis.
  
The diagram that illustrates this setup typically shows:
- The motor depicted as a cylindrical or rectangular component on one end.
- The lead screw as a long threaded rod.
- The nut as a block around the lead screw, sometimes with an arrow indicating the direction of movement.

To visualize this difference, look for a figure that illustrates two curves diverging in the plastic region. The true stress-strain curve should rise more steeply compared to the engineering stress-strain curve after yielding.",0a8fb54562737e2302cb7c4d05e5814ce98b29d1e6e02a775301a97e8eee694e.jpg

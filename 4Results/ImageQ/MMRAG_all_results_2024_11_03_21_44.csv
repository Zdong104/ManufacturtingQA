FIGURE 29.1  The  basic conﬁ  guration and  electrical circuit of an  arc-welding process.  

Movement of the electrode relative to the work is accomplished by either a  human welder (manual welding) or by mechanical means (i.e., machine welding,  automatic welding, or robotic welding). One of the troublesome aspects of manual  arc welding is that the quality of the weld joint depends on the skill and work ethic  of the human welder. Productivity is also an issue. It is often measured as  arc time   (also called  arc-on time )—the proportion of hours worked that arc welding is being  accomplished:  

$$
\mathrm{arc\;time}=(\mathrm{time}\;\mathrm{arc\;is\;on})/(\mathrm{hours\;worked})
$$  

This deﬁ  nition can be applied to an individual welder or to a mechanized worksta- tion. For manual welding, arc time is usually around $20\%$ . Frequent rest periods are  needed by the welder to overcome fatigue in manual arc welding, which requires  hand–eye coordination under stressful conditions. Arc time increases to about  $50\%$ (more or less, depending on the operation) for machine, automatic, and robotic  welding.  

# 29.1.1  GENERAL TECHNOLOGY OF ARC WELDING  

Before describing the individual AW processes, it is instructional to examine some of  the general technical issues that apply to these processes.  

Electrodes  Electrodes used in AW processes are classiﬁ  ed as consumable or non- consumable.  Consumable electrodes  provide the source of the ﬁ  ller metal in arc  welding. These electrodes are available in two principal forms: rods (also called  sticks) and wire. The problem with consumable welding rods, at least in production  welding operations, is that they must be changed periodically, reducing arc time of  the welder. Consumable weld wire has the advantage that it can be continuously fed  into the weld pool from spools containing long lengths of wire, thus avoiding the  frequent interruptions that occur when using welding sticks. In both rod and wire  forms, the electrode is consumed by the arc during the welding process and added to  the weld joint as ﬁ  ller metal.  

Nonconsumable electrodes  are made of tungsten (or carbon, rarely), which resists  melting by the arc. Despite its name, a nonconsumable electrode is gradually deplet- ed during the welding process (vaporization is the principal mechanism), analogous  to the gradual wearing of a cutting tool in a machining operation. For AW processes  that utilize nonconsumable electrodes, any ﬁ  ller metal used in the operation must be  supplied by means of a separate wire that is fed into the weld pool.  

Arc Shielding  At the high temperatures in arc welding, the metals being joined are  chemically reactive to oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen in the air. The mechanical prop- erties of the weld joint can be seriously degraded by these reactions. Thus, some means  to shield the arc from the surrounding air is provided in nearly all AW processes. Arc  shielding is accomplished by covering the electrode tip, arc, and molten weld pool with  a blanket of gas or ﬂ  ux, or both, which inhibit exposure of the weld metal to air.  

Common shielding gases include argon and helium, both of which are inert. In  the welding of ferrous metals with certain AW processes, oxygen and carbon dioxide  are used, usually in combination with Ar and/or He, to produce an oxidizing atmos- phere or to control weld shape.  

A  ﬂ  ux  is a substance used to prevent the formation of oxides and other unwanted  contaminants, or to dissolve them and facilitate removal. During welding, the ﬂ  ux  melts and becomes a liquid slag, covering the operation and protecting the molten  weld metal. The slag hardens upon cooling and must be removed later by chipping or  brushing. Flux is usually formulated to serve several additional functions: (1) provide  a protective atmosphere for welding, (2) stabilize the arc, and (3) reduce spattering. # Welding  Processes

Welding processes divide into two major categories: (1)  fusion welding , in which coalescence is accomplished  by melting the two part surfaces to be joined, in some  cases adding ﬁ  ller metal to the joint; and (2)  solid-state  welding , in which heat and/or pressure are used to  achieve coalescence, but no melting of the base metals  occurs and no ﬁ  ller metal is added.  

Fusion welding is by far the more important cate- gory. It includes (1) arc welding, (2) resistance welding,  (3) oxyfuel gas welding, and (4) other fusion welding  processes—ones that cannot be classiﬁ  ed as any of the  ﬁ  rst three types. Fusion welding processes are discussed  in the ﬁ  rst four sections of this chapter. Section 29.5  covers solid-state welding. And in the ﬁ  nal three sec- tions of the chapter, issues common to all welding opera- tions are examined: weld quality, weldability, and design  for welding.

#  Arc Welding  

Arc welding (AW) is a fusion-welding process in which  coalescence of the metals is achieved by the heat of an  electric arc between an electrode and the work. The  same basic process is also used in arc cutting (Section  25.3.4). A generic AW process is shown in Figure 29.1.  An electric arc is a discharge of electric current across a  gap in a circuit. It is sustained by the presence of a ther- mally ionized column of gas (called a plasma) through  which current ﬂ  ows. To initiate the arc in an AW proc- ess, the electrode is brought into contact with the work  and then quickly separated from it by a short distance.  The electric energy from the arc thus formed produces  temperatures of  $5500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ $(10{,}000^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  or higher, sufﬁ  - ciently hot to melt any metal. A pool of molten metal,  consisting of base metal(s) and ﬁ  ller metal (if one is  used) is formed near the tip of the electrode. In most  arc-welding processes, ﬁ  ller metal is added during the  operation to increase the volume and strength of the  weld joint. As the electrode is moved along the joint,  the molten weld pool solidiﬁ  es in its wake.

Cermets  are deﬁ  ned as composites of  cer amic and  met allic materials (Section 9.2.1).  Technically speaking, cemented carbides are included within this deﬁ  nition; how- ever, cermets based on WC–Co, including WC–TiC–TaC–Co, are known as carbides  (cemented carbides) in common usage. In cutting-tool terminology, the term cer- met is applied to ceramic-metal composites containing TiC, TiN, and certain other  ceramics not including WC. One of the advances in cutting-tool materials involves  the application of a very thin coating to a WC–Co substrate. These tools are called  coated carbides. Thus, there are three important and closely related tool materials to  discuss: (1) cemented carbides, (2) cermets, and (3) coated carbides.  

Cemented Carbides  Cemented carbides (also called  sintered carbides ) are a  class of hard tool material formulated from tungsten carbide (WC, Section 7.3.2)  using powder metallurgy techniques (Chapter 15) with cobalt (Co) as the binder  (Sections 9.2.1 and 16.3.1). There may be other carbide compounds in the mixture,  such as titanium carbide (TiC) and/or tantalum carbide (TaC), in addition to WC.  

The ﬁ  rst cemented carbide cutting tools were made of WC–Co (Historical  Note 7.2) and could be used to machine cast irons and nonsteel materials at cut- ting speeds faster than those possible with high-speed steel and cast cobalt alloys.  However, when the straight WC–Co tools were used to cut steel, crater wear oc- curred rapidly, leading to early failure of the tools. A strong chemical afﬁ  nity exists  between steel and the carbon in WC, resulting in accelerated wear by diffusion  and chemical reaction at the tool–chip interface for this work-tool combination.  Consequently, straight WC–Co tools cannot be used effectively to machine steel. It  was subsequently discovered that additions of titanium carbide and tantalum car- bide to the WC–Co mix signiﬁ  cantly retarded the rate of crater wear when cutting  steel. These new WC–TiC–TaC–Co tools could be used for steel machining. The re- sult is that cemented carbides are divided into two basic types: (1) nonsteel-cutting  grades, consisting of only WC–Co; and (2) steel-cutting grades, with combinations  of TiC and TaC added to the WC–Co.  

The general properties of the two types of cemented carbides are similar: (1) high  compressive strength but low-to-moderate tensile strength; (2) high hardness (90 to  95 HRA); (3) good hot hardness; (4) good wear resistance; (5) high thermal conduc- tivity; (6) high modulus of elasticity $\cdot\!-\!E$  values up to around  $600\times10^{3}$  MPa ( $(90\times$ $10^{6}\mathrm{lb/in}^{2}$ ); and (7) toughness lower than high-speed steel.  

Nonsteel-cutting grades  refer to those cemented carbides that are suitable for  machining aluminum, brass, copper, magnesium, titanium, and other nonferrous  metals; anomalously, gray cast iron is included in this group of work materials. In  the nonsteel-cutting grades, grain size and cobalt content are the factors that inﬂ  u- ence properties of the cemented carbide material. The typical grain size found in  conventional cemented carbides ranges between 0.5 and $5\,\mu\mathrm{m}$  (20 and $200\,\mu$ -in). As  grain size is increased, hardness and hot hardness decrease, but transverse rupture  strength increases.  The typical cobalt content in cemented carbides used for cutting  tools is 3 to  $12\%$ . The effect of cobalt content on hardness and transverse rupture  strength is shown in Figure 9.9. As cobalt content increases, TRS improves at the  expense of hardness and wear resistance. Figure 7.1  shows a collection of new ceramic parts, most of which are made of alumina.  

# 7.3.2  CARBIDES  

The carbide ceramics include silicon carbide (SiC), tungsten carbide (WC), titani-  um carbide (TiC), tantalum carbide (TaC), and chromium carbide  $\left({\mathrm{Cr}}_{3}{\mathrm{C}}_{2}\right)$ . Silicon  carbide was discussed previously. A part made of SiC is also shown in Figure 7.1.  Although it is a man-made ceramic, the methods for its production were developed  a century ago, and therefore it is generally included in the traditional ceramics group.  In addition to its use as an abrasive, other SiC applications include resistance heating  elements and additives in steelmaking.

WC, TiC, and TaC are valued for their hardness and wear resistance in cutting  tools and other applications requiring these properties.  Tungsten carbide  was the  first to be developed (Historical Note 7.2) and is the most important and widely used  material in the group. WC is typically produced by carburizing tungsten powders  that have been reduced from tungsten ores such as  wolframite  $(\mathrm{FeMnWO_{4}})$ ) and  scheelite  $(\mathrm{CaWO4})$ .  Titanium carbide  is produced by carburizing the minerals  rutile  $(\mathrm{TiO}_{2})$  or  ilmenite  $\left(\mathrm{FeTiO}_{3}\right)$ ). And  tantalum carbide  is made by carburizing either  pure tantalum powders or tantalum pentoxide  $(\mathrm{Ta}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{5})$  [11].  Chromium carbide  is  more suited to applications where chemical stability and oxidation resistance are  important. $\mathrm{Cr}_{3}\mathrm{C}_{2}$  is prepared by carburizing chromium oxide $\left(\mathrm{Cr}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$  as the starting  compound. Carbon black is the usual source of carbon in all of these reactions.

An advantage of brazing over  welding in lap joints is that the ﬁ  ller metal is bonded to the base parts throughout  the entire interface area between the parts, rather than only at the edges (as in ﬁ  llet  welds made by arc welding) or at discrete spots (as in resistance spot welding).  

Clearance between mating surfaces of the base parts is important in brazing. The  clearance must be large enough so as not to restrict molten ﬁ  ller metal from ﬂ  owing  throughout the entire interface. Yet if the joint clearance is too great, capillary action  will be reduced and there will be areas between the parts where no ﬁ  ller metal is  present. Joint strength is affected by clearance, as depicted in Figure 30.3. There is an

optimum clearance value at which joint strength is maximized. The issue is compli- cated by the fact that the optimum depends on base and ﬁ  ller metals, joint conﬁ  gu- ration, and processing conditions. Typical brazing clearances in practice are 0.025 to  $0.25~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.001–0.010 in). These values represent the joint clearance at the brazing  temperature, which may be different from room temperature clearance, depending  on thermal expansion of the base metal(s).  

Cleanliness of the joint surfaces prior to brazing is also important. Surfaces  must be free of oxides, oils, and other contaminants in order to promote wetting  and capillary attraction during the process, as well as bonding across the entire  interface. Chemical treatments such as solvent cleaning (Section 28.1.1) and  mechanical treatments such as wire brushing and sand blasting (Section 28.1.2)  are used to clean the surfaces. After cleaning and during the brazing operation,  ﬂ  uxes are used to maintain surface cleanliness and promote wetting for capillary  action in the clearance between faying surfaces.  

# 30.1.2  FILLER METALS AND FLUXES  

Common ﬁ  ller metals used in brazing are listed in Table 30.1 along with the principal  base metals on which they are typically used. To qualify as a brazing metal, the fol- lowing characteristics are needed: (1) melting temperature must be compatible with  the base metal, (2) surface tension in the liquid phase must be low for good wettabil- ity, (3) ﬂ  uidity of the molten metal must be high for penetration into the interface,  (4) the metal must be capable of being brazed into a joint of adequate strength for  the application, and (5) chemical and physical interactions with base metal (e.g., gal- vanic reaction) must be avoided. Filler metals are applied to the brazing operation in  various ways, including wire, rod, sheets and strips, powders, pastes, preformed parts  made of braze metal designed to ﬁ  t a particular joint conﬁ  guration, and cladding  on one of the surfaces to be brazed. Several of these techniques are illustrated in  Figures 30.4 and 30.5. Braze metal pastes, shown in Figure 30.5, consist of ﬁ  ller metal  powders mixed with ﬂ  uid ﬂ  uxes and binders.  

Brazing ﬂ  uxes serve a similar purpose as in welding; they dissolve, combine with,  and otherwise inhibit the formation of oxides and other unwanted byproducts in the

! Brazing has several advantages compared to welding: (1) any metals can be  joined, including dissimilar metals; (2) certain brazing methods can be performed  quickly and consistently, thus permitting high cycle rates and automated production;  (3) some methods allow multiple joints to be brazed simultaneously; (4) brazing can  be applied to join thin-walled parts that cannot be welded; (5) in general, less heat  and power are required than in fusion welding; (6) problems with the heat-affected  zone in the base metal near the joint are reduced; and (7) joint areas that are inac- cessible by many welding processes can be brazed, since capillary action draws the  molten ﬁ  ller metal into the joint.  

Disadvantages and limitations of brazing include (1) joint strength is gener- ally less than that of a welded joint; (2) although strength of a good brazed joint is  greater than that of the ﬁ  ller metal, it is likely to be less than that of the base metals;  (3) high service temperatures may weaken a brazed joint; and (4) the color of the  metal in the brazed joint may not match the color of the base metal parts, a possible  aesthetic disadvantage.  

Brazing as a production process is widely used in a variety of industries, including  automotive (e.g., joining tubes and pipes), electrical equipment (e.g., joining wires  and cables), cutting tools (e.g., brazing cemented carbide inserts to shanks), and jew- elry making. In addition, the chemical processing industry and plumbing and heating  contractors join metal pipes and tubes by brazing. The process is used extensively for  repair and maintenance work in nearly all industries.  

# 30.1.1  BRAZED JOINTS  

Brazed joints are commonly of two types: butt and lap (Section 29.2.1). However, the  two types have been adapted for the brazing process in several ways. The conven- tional butt joint provides a limited area for brazing, thus jeopardizing the strength  of the joint. To increase the faying areas in brazed joints, the mating parts are often  scarfed or stepped or otherwise altered, as shown in Figure 30.1. Of course, addi- tional processing is usually required in the making of the parts for these special joints.

FIGURE 30.2  (a) Conventional lap joint, and adaptations of the lap joint for brazing: (b) cylindrical parts, (c) sandwiched  parts, and (d) use of sleeve to convert butt joint into lap joint.  

One of the particular difﬁ  culties associated with a scarfed joint is the problem of  maintaining the alignment of the parts before and during brazing.  

Lap joints are more widely used in brazing, since they can provide a relatively large  interface area between the parts. An overlap of at least three times the thickness of  the thinner part is generally considered good design practice. Some adaptations of  the lap joint for brazing are illustrated in Figure 30.2. An advantage of brazing over  welding in lap joints is that the ﬁ  ller metal is bonded to the base parts throughout  the entire interface area between the parts, rather than only at the edges (as in ﬁ  llet  welds made by arc welding) or at discrete spots (as in resistance spot welding).  

Clearance between mating surfaces of the base parts is important in brazing. The  clearance must be large enough so as not to restrict molten ﬁ  ller metal from ﬂ  owing  throughout the entire interface. Yet if the joint clearance is too great, capillary action  will be reduced and there will be areas between the parts where no ﬁ  ller metal is  present.

Material transport equipment is used to move parts and materials between work- stations in the factory. This movement may include intermediate stops for temporary  storage of work-in-process. There are ﬁ  ve main types of material transport equip- ment: (1) industrial trucks, the most important of which are fork lift trucks, (2) auto- mated guided vehicles, (3) rail-guided vehicles, (4) conveyors, and (5) hoists and  cranes.

Two general categories of material transport equipment can be distinguished,  according to the type of routing between workstations: ﬁ  xed and variable. In  ﬁ  xed  routing , all of the work units are moved through the same sequence of stations. This  implies that the processing sequence required on all work units is either identical or  very similar. Fixed routing is used on manual assembly lines and automated production  lines.

Storage systems in factories are used for temporary storage of raw materials, work- in-process, and ﬁ  nished products. Storage systems can be classiﬁ  ed into two general cat- egories: (1) conventional storage methods and equipment, which include bulk storage  in an open area, rack systems, and shelves; and (2) automated storage systems, which  include rack systems served by automatic cranes that store and retrieve pallet loads.  

Finally, unitizing refers to containers used to hold individual items during trans- port and storage, as well as equipment used to make up such unit loads. Containers  include pallets, tote pans, boxes, and baskets that hold parts during handling. Uni- tizing equipment includes palletizers that are used to load and stack cartons onto  pallets and depalletizers that are used to accomplish the unloading operation. Pal- letizers and depalletizers are generally associated with cartons of ﬁ  nished product  leaving a facility and boxes of raw materials coming into the facility, respectively.  

Section 1.4.1 describes four types of plant layout: (1) ﬁ  xed position layout, (2)  process layout, (3) cellular layout, and (4) product layout. In general, different types  of material handling methods and equipment are associated with these four types, as  summarized in Table 38.2.

Production lines are an important class of manufacturing system when large quan- tities of identical or similar products are to be made. They are suited to situations  where the total work to be performed on the product or part consists of many sepa- rate steps. Examples include assembled products (e.g., automobiles and appliances)  and mass-produced machined parts on which multiple machining operations are  required (e.g., engine blocks and transmission housings).

#  Fundamentals of Production Lines  

Production lines are an important class of manufacturing system when large quan- tities of identical or similar products are to be made. They are suited to situations  where the total work to be performed on the product or part consists of many sepa- rate steps. Examples include assembled products (e.g., automobiles and appliances)  and mass-produced machined parts on which multiple machining operations are  required (e.g., engine blocks and transmission housings). In a production line, the  total work is divided into small tasks, and workers or machines perform these tasks  with great efﬁ  ciency. For purposes of organization production lines are divided into  two basic types: manual assembly lines and automated production lines. However,  hybrid lines consisting of both manual and automated operations are not uncom- mon. Before examining these particular systems, some of the general issues involved  in production line design and operation are considered.  

A  production line  consists of a series of workstations arranged so that the product  moves from one station to the next, and at each location a portion of the total work is  performed on it, as depicted in Figure 38.2. The production rate of the line is limited by  its slowest station. Workstations whose pace is faster than the slowest will ultimately  be limited by that bottleneck station. Transfer of the product along the line is usu- ally accomplished by a conveyor system or mechanical transfer device, although some  manual lines simply pass the product from worker to worker by hand. Production lines  are associated with mass production. If the product quantities are high and the work  can be divided into separate tasks that can be assigned to individual workstations, then  a production line is the most appropriate manufacturing system.  

# 38.2.1  METHODS OF WORK TRANSPORT  

There are various ways of moving work units from one workstation to the next. The  two basic categories are manual and mechanized.  

Manual Methods of Work Transport  Manual methods involve passing the work  units between stations by hand. These methods are associated with manual assembly  lines. In some cases, the output of each station is collected in a box or tote pan; when  the box is full it is moved to the next station. This can result in a signiﬁ  cant amount of  in-process inventory, which is undesirable. In other cases, work units are moved indi- vidually along a ﬂ  at table or unpowered conveyor (e.g., a roller conveyor). When the  task is ﬁ  nished at each station, the worker simply pushes the unit toward the down- stream station. Space is usually allowed for one or more units to collect between  stations, thereby relaxing the requirement for all workers to perform their respective

tasks in sync. One problem associated with manual methods of work transport is the  difﬁ  culty in controlling the production rate on the line. Workers tend to work at a  slower pace unless some mechanical means of pacing them is provided.  

Mechanized Methods of Work Transport  Powered mechanical systems are com- monly used to move work units along a production line. These systems include lift- and-carry devices, pick-and-place mechanisms, powered conveyors (e.g., overhead  chain conveyors, belt conveyors, and chain-in-ﬂ  oor conveyors), and other material  handling equipment, sometimes combining several types on the same line. Three  major types of work transfer systems are used on production lines: (1) continuous  transfer, (2) synchronous transfer, and (3) asynchronous transfer.  

Continuous transfer systems  consist of a continuously moving conveyor that  operates at a constant velocity. The continuous transfer system is most common on  manual assembly lines. Two cases are distinguished: (1) parts are ﬁ  xed to the con- veyor and (2) parts can be removed from the conveyor.

In part (a), it illustrates a fully anisotropic etch with $A = \infty$, where the etching is highly directional, resulting in vertical sidewalls.

In general, wet chemical etching is isotropic, and so  the mask pattern must be sized to compensate for this effect, just as in chemical  machining (Section 25.4).  

Note also that the etchant does not attack the layer below the target material in  this illustration. In the ideal case, an etching solution can be formulated that will  react only with the target material and not with other materials in contact with it.  In practical cases, the other materials exposed to the etchant may be attacked but  to a lesser degree than the target material. The  etch selectivity  of the etchant is the  ratio of etching rates between the target material and some other material, such as  a mask or substrate. For example, etch selectivity of hydroﬂ  uoric acid for  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  over  Si is inﬁ  nite.

FIGURE 33.14  Proﬁ  le of a properly  etched layer.  

If process control is inadequate, either under-etching or over-etching can occur, as  in Figure 33.15. Underetching, in which the target layer is not completely removed,  results when the etching time is too short and/or the etching solution is too weak.  Over-etching involves too much of the target material being removed, resulting in  loss of pattern deﬁ  nition and possible damage to the layer beneath the target layer.  Over-etching is caused by overexposure to the etchant.  

Dry Plasma Etching   This etching process uses an ionized gas to etch a target  material. The ionized gas is created by introducing an appropriate gas mixture into  a vacuum chamber and using radio frequency (RF) electrical energy to ionize a  portion of the gas, thus creating a plasma. The high-energy plasma reacts with the  target surface, vaporizing the material to remove it. There are several ways in which  a plasma can be used to etch a material; the two principal processes in IC fabrication  are plasma etching and reactive ion etching.  

In  plasma etching , the function of the ionized gas is to generate atoms or molecules  that are chemically very reactive, so that the target surface is chemically etched upon  exposure. The plasma etchants are usually based on ﬂ  uorine or chlorine gases. Etch  selectivity is generally more of a problem in plasma etching than in wet chemical etch- ing. For example, etch selectivity for $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  over Si in a typical plasma etching process is  15 at best [4], compared with inﬁ  nity when HF chemical etching is used.  

An alternative function of the ionized gas can be to physically bombard the target  material, causing atoms to be ejected from the surface. This is the process of sputter- ing, one of the techniques in physical vapor deposition. When used for etching, the  process is called  sputter etching . Although this form of etching has been applied in  semi  conductor processing, it is much more common to combine sputtering with plasma

! (Section 33.4.5), but its consequence is greater in microfabrication because of the  larger aspect ratios. The term  bulk micromachining  is used for the relatively deep  wet etching process into single-crystal silicon substrate (Si wafer); whereas the term  surface micromachining  refers to the planar structuring of the substrate surface,  using much more shallow layering processes.  

Bulk micromachining can be used to create thin membranes in a microstructure.  However, a method is needed to control the etching penetration into the silicon, so  as to leave the membrane layer. A common method used for this purpose is to dope  the silicon substrate with boron atoms, which signiﬁ  cantly reduce the etching rate  of the silicon. The processing sequence is shown in Figure 35.9. In step (2), epitaxial  deposition is used to apply the upper layer of silicon so that it will possess the same  single-crystal structure and lattice orientation as the substrate (Section 33.4.2). This  is a requirement of bulk micromachining that will be used to provide the deeply  etched region in subsequent processing. The use of boron doping to establish the  etch resistant layer of silicon is called the $\pmb{p}^{+}$   etch-stop technique .  

Surface micromachining can be used to construct cantilevers, overhangs, and similar  structures on a silicon substrate, as shown in part (5) of Figure 35.10. The cantilevered

beams in the ﬁ  gure are parallel to but separated by a gap from the silicon surface. Gap  size and beam thickness are in the micron range. The process sequence to fabricate this  type of structure is depicted in the earlier parts of Figure 35.10.  

Dry etching, which involves material removal through the physical and/or chemi- cal interaction between the ions in an ionized gas (a plasma) and the atoms of a sur- face that has been exposed to the ionized gas (Section 33.4.5), provides anisotropic  etching in almost any material. Its anisotropic penetration characteristic is not lim- ited to a single-crystal silicon substrate. On the other hand, etch selectivity is more  of a problem in dry etching; that is, any surfaces exposed to the plasma are attacked.  

A procedure called the  lift-off technique  is used in microfabrication to pattern  metals such as platinum on a substrate.

# 39.3.1  AGGREGATE PLANNING AND THE MASTER PRODUCTION SCHEDULE  

Any manufacturing ﬁ  rm must have a business plan, and the plan must include what  products will be produced, how many, and when. The manufacturing plan should take  into account current orders and sales forecasts, inventory levels, and plant capacity.  

![](images/00fc74d3124ec1945d0ed1006c841ef57a56c28de19aa094f6d85495afc4db67.jpg)  
FIGURE 39.7  Activities in a production planning and control system.  

The  aggregate production plan  indicates production output levels for major  product lines rather than speciﬁ  c products. It must be coordinated with the sales  and marketing plan of the company. Aggregate planning is therefore a high-level  corporate planning activity, although details of the planning process are delegated  to staff. The aggregate plan must reconcile the marketing plans for current products  and new products under development against the capacity resources available to  make those products.  

The planned output levels of the major product lines in the aggregate schedule  must be converted into a speciﬁ  c schedule of individual products. This is called the  master production schedule  (or  master schedule , for short), and it lists the products  to be manufactured, when they should be completed, and in what quantities.  

Three categories of items are listed in the master schedule: (1) ﬁ  rm customer  orders, (2) forecasted demand, and (3) spare parts. Customer orders for speciﬁ  c  products usually obligate the company to a delivery date that has been promised to  a customer by the sales department. The second category consists of production out- put levels based on forecasted demand, in which statistical forecasting techniques  are applied to previous demand patterns, estimates by the sales staff, and other  sources. The third category is demand for individual component parts—repair parts  to be stocked in the ﬁ  rm’s service department. Some companies exclude this third  category from the master schedule because it does not represent end products.  

The master production schedule must consider the lead times required to order  raw materials and components, fabricate parts in the factory, and then assemble and  test the ﬁ  nal products. Depending on type of product, these lead times can run from  several months to more than a year. It is usually considered to be ﬁ  xed in the near  term, meaning that changes are not allowed within about a six-week horizon. How- ever, adjustments in the schedule beyond six weeks are possible to cope with shifts in  demand or new product opportunities. It should therefore be noted that the aggre- gate production plan is not the only input to the master schedule. Other drivers that  may cause it to deviate from the aggregate plan include new customer orders and  changes in sales over the near term.  

# 39.3.2  MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS PLANNING  

Two techniques for planning and controlling production are used in industry, depend- ing on product variety and production quantities. This section covers procedures for  job shop and midrange production of assembled products. Section 39.4 examines  procedures appropriate for high production.  

Material requirements planning (MRP) is a computational procedure used to con- vert the master production schedule for end products into a detailed schedule for raw  materials and components used in the end products. The detailed schedule indicates  the quantities of each item, when it must be ordered, and when it must be delivered  to implement the master schedule.  Capacity requirements planning  (Section 39.3.3)  coordinates labor and equipment resources with material requirements.  

MRP is most appropriate for job shop and batch production of products that have  multiple components, each of which must be purchased and/or fabricated. It is a tech- nique that determines the quantities of items used in end products. Once the number  of end products has been decided and included in the master production schedule,  then the numbers of each component can be directly computed. For example, each  car listed in the master schedule needs four tires (ﬁ  ve, if the spare is included). Thus,  if the production schedule calls for 1000 cars to be produced in a certain week, the  plant needs to order 4000 tires for those cars. Demand for the end products may be  forecasted, but materials and parts used in the end products are not.  

MRP is relatively straightforward in concept. Order release is driven by two principal inputs, as indicated in Figure 39.8: (1)  material requirements planning, which provides the authorization to produce; and  (2) engineering and manufacturing database that indicates product structure and  process planning details required to generate the documents that accompany the  order through the shop.  

Order Scheduling  Order scheduling assigns the production orders to work  centers in the factory. It serves as the dispatching function in production control.  In order scheduling, a dispatch list is prepared indicating which orders should be  accomplished at each work center. It also provides relative priorities for the dif- ferent jobs (e.g., by showing due dates for each job). The dispatch list helps the  department foreman assign work and allocate resources to achieve the master  schedule.  

Order scheduling addresses two problems in production planning and con- trol: machine loading and job sequencing. To schedule production orders through  the factory, they must ﬁ  rst be assigned to work centers. Assigning orders to work  centers is called  machine loading . Loading all of the work centers in the plant is  called  shop loading . Since the number of production orders is likely to exceed the  number of work centers, each work center will have a queue of orders waiting to  be processed.  

Job sequencing  deals with the problem of deciding the sequence in which to  process jobs through a given machine. The processing sequence is decided by  means of priorities among the jobs in the queue. The relative priorities are deter- mined by a function called  priority control . Some of the rules used to establish  priorities for production orders in a plant include (1)  ﬁ  rst-come-ﬁ  rst-serve — orders are processed in the sequence in which they arrive at the work center; (2)  earliest due date —orders with earlier due dates are given higher priorities; (3)  shortest processing time —orders with shorter processing times are given higher  priorities; and (4)  least slack time —orders with the least slack in their schedule  are given higher priorities (slack time is deﬁ  ned as the difference between the  time remaining until due date and the process time remaining). When a job is  completed at one work center, it is moved to the next machine in its routing. It  becomes part of the machine loading for that work center, and priority control  is again used to determine the sequence among jobs to be processed at that  machine.  

Order Progress  Order progress in shop ﬂ  oor control monitors the status of the  orders, work-in-process, and other parameters in the plant that indicate progress and  performance. The objective is to provide information to manage production based  on data collected from the factory.  

Various techniques are available to collect data from factory operations. The  techniques range from clerical procedures requiring workers to submit paper forms  that are later compiled, to highly automated systems requiring minimal human par- ticipation. The term  factory data collection system  is sometimes used for these tech- niques. More complete coverage of this topic is presented in [6].  

Information presented to management is often summarized in the form of  reports. These include (1)  work order status reports , which indicate status of pro- duction orders, including the work center where each order is located, processing  hours remaining before each order will be completed, whether the job is on time,  and priority level; (2)  progress reports  that report shop performance during a cer- tain time period such as a week or month—how many orders were completed dur- ing the period, how many orders should have been completed during the period but  were not completed, and so forth; and (3)  exception reports  that indicate deviations  from the production schedule, such as overdue jobs. These reports are helpful to  management in deciding resource allocation issues, authorizing overtime, and iden- tifying problem areas that adversely affect achievement of the master production  schedule.  

# 39.3.5  ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING  

The ﬁ  rst MRP systems released in the 1970s were limited to the planning of pur- chase orders and production work orders derived from the master production sched- ule. They did not include capacity planning and feedback of data from the factory.  These deﬁ  ciencies became apparent by the 1980s, and additional capabilities were  added to the basic MRP packages, including capacity requirements planning and  shop ﬂ  oor control. The term manufacturing resource planning was used to distin- guish the enhanced systems from the initial material requirements planning, and the  abbreviation MRP II was adopted.

For comparison, the Rockwell C  hardness for hardened tool steel is 65 HRC. The HRC scale does not extend high  enough to be used for the harder materials.  

Polymers  Polymers have the lowest hardness among the three types of engineer- ing materials. Table 3.8 lists several of the polymers on the Brinell hardness scale, al- though this testing method is not normally used for these materials. It does, however,  allow comparison with the hardness of metals.  

# 3.3 3.3  Effect of Temperature on Properties  

Temperature has a signiﬁ  cant effect on nearly all properties of a material. It is im- portant for the designer to know the material properties at the operating tempera- tures of the product when in service. It is also important to know how temperature  affects mechanical properties in manufacturing. At elevated temperatures, materials  are lower in strength and higher in ductility. The general relationships for metals are  depicted in Figure 3.15. Thus, most metals can be formed more easily at elevated  temperatures than when they are cold.  

![](images/5fea3b91d530155c8ea560b5a37ca6938b3ccf1c15cb1af3272687bd8f075480.jpg)  
FIGURE 3.15  General effect of  temperature on strength and ductility.  

Hot Hardness  A property often used to characterize strength and hardness at el- evated temperatures is hot hardness.  Hot hardness  is simply the ability of a material  to retain hardness at elevated temperatures; it is usually presented as either a listing  of hardness values at different temperatures or as a plot of hardness versus tempera- ture, as in Figure 3.16. Steels can be alloyed to achieve signiﬁ  cant improvements in  hot hardness, as shown in the ﬁ  gure. Ceramics exhibit superior properties at elevated  temperatures compared with other materials. They are often selected for high tem- perature applications, such as turbine parts, cutting tools, and refractory applications.  Good hot hardness is also desirable in the tooling materials used in many manu- facturing operations. Signiﬁ  cant amounts of heat energy are generated in most met- alworking processes, and the tools must be capable of withstanding the high tem- peratures involved.  

Recrystallization Temperature  Most metals behave at room temperature ac- cording to the ﬂ  ow curve in the plastic region. As the metal is strained, it increases in  strength because of strain hardening (the strain-hardening exponent  $n>0$ ). How- ever, if the metal is heated to a sufﬁ  ciently elevated temperature and then   deformed,  

![](images/014fc747f1ea967f342c73d77fb862743e35935a97e64a576069c9340a634694.jpg)  
FIGURE 3.16  Hot hardness—typical  hardness as a function of temperature for  several materials.  

strain hardening does not occur. Instead, new grains are formed that are free of  strain, and the metal behaves as a perfectly plastic material, that is, with a strain- hardening exponent  $n\,=\,0$ . The formation of new strain-free grains is a process  called  recrystallization , and the temperature at which it occurs is about one-half  the melting point  $(0.5~T_{m})$ , as measured on an absolute scale (R or K). This is called  the  recrystallization temperature . Recrystallization takes time. The recrystallization  temperature for a particular metal is usually speciﬁ  ed as the temperature at which  complete formation of new grains requires about 1 hour.  

Recrystallization is a temperature-dependent characteristic of metals that can be  exploited in manufacturing. By heating the metal to the recrystallization tempera- ture before deformation, the amount of straining that the metal can endure is sub- stantially increased, and the forces and power required to carry out the process are  signiﬁ  cantly reduced. Forming metals at temperatures above the recrystallization  temperature is called  hot working  (Section 17.3).  

Fluids behave quite differently than solids. ![](images/14dc386dc65ef9cccc73ac59cd168378652f9657f137e59cedd1385629908694.jpg)  

melt (and freeze) at a single temperature. These issues are examined in the discus-  sion of phase diagrams in Chapter 6.  

Another difference in melting occurs with noncrystalline materials (glasses). In  these materials, there is a gradual transition from solid to liquid states. The solid  material gradually softens as temperature increases, finally becoming liquid at the  melting point. During softening, the material has a consistency of increasing plasticity  (increasingly like a fluid) as it gets closer to the melting point.  

These differences in melting characteristics among pure metals, alloys, and glass  are portrayed in Figure 4.1. The plots show changes in density as a function of tem-  perature for three hypothetical materials: a pure metal, an alloy, and glass. Plotted in  the figure is the volumetric change, which is the reciprocal of density.  

The importance of melting in manufacturing is obvious. In metal casting  (Chapters 10 and 11), the metal is melted and then poured into a mold cavity. Metals  with  lower melting points are generally easier to cast, but if the melting temperature is too  low, the metal loses its applicability as an engineering material. Melting char-  acteristics of polymers are important in plastic molding and other polymer shaping  processes (Chapter 13). Sintering of powdered metals and ceramics requires knowl-  edge of melting points. Sintering does not melt the materials, but the temperatures  used in the process must approach the melting point to achieve the required bond-  ing of the powders (Chapters 15 and 16).  

Much of the previous section is concerned with the effects of temperature on volu-  metric properties of materials. Certainly, thermal expansion, melting, and heat of  fusion are thermal properties because temperature determines the thermal energy  level of the atoms, leading to the changes in the materials.

# 4.2.1  SPECIFIC   HEAT   AND   THERMAL   CONDUCTIVITY  

The specific heat  $C$   of a material is defined as the quantity of heat energy required to  increase the temperature of a unit mass of the material by one degree. Some typical  values are listed in Table 4.2. To determine the amount of energy needed to heat a  certain weight of a metal in a furnace to a given elevated temperature, the following  equation can be used:  

$$
H=C\;W\left(T_{2}-T_{1}\right)
$$  

where $H\!=$   amount of heat energy, J (Btu); $C=$   specific heat of the material, $\mathrm{J/kg\,^{\circ}C}$ $\mathrm{(Btu/lb\^{\circ}F)}$ ); $W\!=$   its weight, $\mathrm{kg}$  (lb); and $(T_{2}\textrm{-}T_{1})=$   change in temperature, $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\:(^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ .  The volumetric heat storage capacity of a material is often of interest. This is sim-  ply density multiplied by specific heat $r C$ . Thus,  volumetric specific heat  is the heat  energy required to raise the temperature of a unit volume of material by one degree, $\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{mm}^{3}\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $\mathrm{(Btu/in^{3}\ o F)}$ ).

temperatures. As a consequence, grinding efﬁ  ciency decreases, and the volume of  wheel removed increases relative to the volume of metal removed.  

The  grinding ratio  is a term used to indicate the slope of the wheel wear curve.  Speciﬁ cally,  

$$
G R={\frac{V_{w}}{V_{g}}}
$$  

where  $G R\,=$  the grinding ratio,  $V_{w}=$  the volume of work material removed, and  $V_{g}=$  the corresponding volume of the grinding wheel that is worn in the process.  The grinding ratio has the most signiﬁ  cance in the linear wear region of Figure 24.5.  Typical values of  $G R$  range between 95 and 125 [5], which is about ﬁ  ve orders of  magnitude less than the analogous ratio in conventional machining. Grinding ratio  is generally increased by increasing wheel speed $\nu$ . The reason for this is that the size  of the chip formed by each grit is smaller with higher speeds, so the amount of grain  fracture is reduced. Because higher wheel speeds also improve surface ﬁ  nish, there  is a general advantage in operating at high grinding speeds. However, when speeds  become too high, attritious wear and surface temperatures increase. As a result, the  grinding ratio is reduced and the surface ﬁ  nish is impaired. This effect was originally  reported by Krabacher [14], as in Figure 24.6.  

When the wheel is in the third region of the wear curve, it must be resharpened  by a procedure called  dressing , which consists of (1) breaking off the dulled grits on  

![](images/019552de9dfb7387e676a9b5fb91496f6f1880430d1b33dbd2b19a7635c34729.jpg)

the outside periphery of the grinding wheel in order to expose fresh sharp grains  and (2) removing chips that have become clogged in the wheel. It is accomplished  by a rotating disk, an abrasive stick, or another grinding wheel operating at high  speed, held against the wheel being dressed as it rotates. Although dressing sharp- ens the wheel, it does not guarantee the shape of the wheel.  Truing  is an alterna- tive procedure that not only sharpens the wheel, but also restores its cylindrical  shape and insures that it is straight across its outside perimeter. The procedure uses  a diamond-pointed tool (other types of truing tools are also used) that is fed slowly  and precisely across the wheel as it rotates. A very light depth is taken ( $0.025\:\mathrm{mm}$  or  less) against the wheel.  

# 24.1.3  APPLICATION CONSIDERATIONS IN GRINDING  

This section attempts to bring together the previous discussion of wheel parameters  and theoretical analysis of grinding and consider their practical application. Also  considered are grinding ﬂ  uids, which are commonly used in grinding operations.  

Application Guidelines  There are many variables in grinding that affect the per- formance and success of the operation. The guidelines listed in Table 24.5 are helpful  in sorting out the many complexities and selecting the proper wheel parameters and  grinding conditions.  

Grinding Fluids  The proper application of cutting ﬂ  uids has been found to be ef- fective in reducing the thermal effects and high work surface temperatures described  previously. Grinding wheels come in a variety of shapes and sizes, as shown in Figure 24.2.  Conﬁ  gurations (a), (b), and (c) are peripheral grinding wheels, in which material re- moval is accomplished by the outside circumference of the wheel. A typical abrasive  cutoff wheel is shown in (d), which also involves peripheral cutting. Wheels (e), (f),  and (g) are face grinding wheels, in which the ﬂ  at face of the wheel removes material  from the work surface.  

# 24.1.2  ANALYSIS OF THE GRINDING PROCESS  

The cutting conditions in grinding are characterized by very high speeds and very  small cut size, compared to milling and other traditional machining operations. Us- ing surface grinding to illustrate, Figure 24.3(a) shows the principal features of the  

![](images/c0f5653a9956b8b7632e62d4d34efd4edbd4dc789f401ba796678082883ddd9d.jpg)  
FIGURE 24.3  (a) The geometry of surface grinding, showing the cutting conditions; (b) assumed longitudinal shape  and (c) cross section of a single chip.  

process. The peripheral speed of the grinding wheel is determined by the rotational  speed of the wheel:  

$$
\nu=\pi D N
$$  

where  $\nu=$  surface speed of wheel, $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{min}$  (ft/min); $N=$ spindle speed, rev/min; and  $D=$  wheel diameter, m (ft).  

Depth of cut $d$ , called the  infeed , is the penetration of the wheel below the origi- nal work surface. As the operation proceeds, the grinding wheel is fed laterally  across the surface on each pass by the work. This is called the  crossfeed , and it  determines the width of the grinding path $w$  in Figure 24.3(a). This width, multi- plied by depth $d$  determines the cross-sectional area of the cut. In most grinding  operations, the work moves past the wheel at a certain speed $\nu_{_{w}}$ , so that the material  removal rate is  

$$
R_{M R}=\nu_{w}w d
$$  

Each grain in the grinding wheel cuts an individual chip whose longitudinal shape  before cutting is shown in Figure 24.3(b) and whose assumed cross-sectional shape  is triangular, as in Figure 24.3(c). At the exit point of the grit from the work, where  the chip cross section is largest, this triangle has height $t$  and width $w^{\prime}$ .  

In a grinding operation, one is interested in how the cutting conditions combine  with the grinding wheel parameters to affect (1) surface ﬁ  nish, (2) forces and energy,  (3) temperature of the work surface, and (4) wheel wear.  

Surface Finish  Most commercial grinding is performed to achieve a surface ﬁ  nish  that is superior to that which can be accomplished with conventional machining. The  surface ﬁ  nish of the work part is affected by the size of the individual chips formed  during grinding. One obvious factor in determining chip size is grit size—smaller grit  sizes yield better ﬁ  nishes.  

Consider the dimensions of an individual chip. From the geometry of the grinding  process in Figure 24.3, it can be shown that the average length of a chip is given by  

$$
l_{c}=\sqrt{D d}
$$  

where  $l_{c}$  is the length of the chip, mm (in); $D=$ wheel diameter, mm (in); and  $d=$ depth of cut, or infeed, mm (in). This assumes the chip is formed by a grit that acts  throughout the entire sweep arc shown in the diagram.  

Figure 24.3(c) shows the assumed cross section of a chip in grinding. The cross- sectional shape is triangular with width  $w^{\prime}$  being greater than the thickness  $t$  by a  factor called the grain aspect ratio $r_{g}$ , deﬁ  ned by  

$$
r_{g}={\frac{w^{\prime}}{t}}
$$  

Typical values of grain aspect ratio are between 10 and 20.  

The number of active grits (cutting teeth) per square inch on the outside periph- ery of the grinding wheel is denoted by  $C$ .

"""Q1"": ""Is there a figure that demonstrates how to achieve a more uniform wall thickness in a drawn cup?"",","""A1"": ""Yes. Figure 19.25 shows the ironing process to achieve a more uniform wall thickness in a drawn cup. It illustrates the start of the process and the stage during the process, highlighting the thinning and elongation of the walls."",","Figure 19.20(5) illustrates the thinning and deformation process in deep drawing, which impacts wall thickness uniformity in a drawn cup.","As the metal in this portion of the blank is drawn toward the  center, the outer perimeter becomes smaller. Because the volume of metal remains  constant, the metal is squeezed and becomes thicker as the perimeter is reduced.  This often results in wrinkling of the remaining ﬂ  ange of the blank, especially when  thin sheet metal is drawn, or when the blankholder force is too low. It is a condition  which cannot be corrected once it has occurred. The friction and compression effects  are illustrated in Figure 19.20(4).  

The holding force applied by the blankholder is now seen to be a critical factor  in deep drawing. If it is too small, wrinkling occurs. If it is too large, it prevents the  metal from ﬂ  owing properly toward the die cavity, resulting in stretching and pos- sible tearing of the sheet metal. Determining the proper holding force involves a  delicate balance between these opposing factors.  

Progressive downward motion of the punch results in a continuation of the metal  ﬂ  ow caused by drawing and compression. In addition, some  thinning  of the cylinder  wall occurs, as in Figure 19.20(5). The force being applied by the punch is opposed  by the metal in the form of deformation and friction in the operation. A portion of  the deformation involves stretching and thinning of the metal as it is pulled over the  edge of the die opening. Up to $25\%$  thinning of the side wall may occur in a success- ful drawing operation, mostly near the base of the cup.  

# 19.3.2  ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF DRAWING  

It is important to assess the limitations on the amount of drawing that can be accom- plished. This is often guided by simple measures that can be readily calculated for a  given operation. In addition, drawing force and holding force are important process  variables. Finally, the starting blank size must be determined.  

Measures of Drawing  One of the measures of the severity of a deep drawing op- eration is the  drawing ratio $D R$ .  This is most easily deﬁ  ned for a cylindrical shape as  the ratio of blank diameter  $D_{b}$  to punch diameter  $D_{p}$ .  In equation form,  

$$
D R=\frac{D_{b}}{D_{p}}
$$  

The drawing ratio provides an indication, albeit a crude one, of the severity of a  given drawing operation. The greater the ratio, the more severe the operation. An  approximate upper limit on the drawing ratio is a value of 2.0. The actual limiting  value for a given operation depends on punch and die corner radii ( ${\cal R}_{p}$  and $R_{d,}$ ), fric- tion conditions, depth of draw, and characteristics of the sheet metal (e.g., ductility,  degree of directionality of strength properties in the metal).  

Another way to characterize a given drawing operation is by the  reduction   $r$ ,  where  

$$
r=\frac{D_{b}-D_{p}}{D_{b}}
$$  

It is very closely related to drawing ratio. Consistent with the previous limit on  $D R$ ( $(D R=2.0\$ ), the value of reduction $r$  should be less than 0.50.  

A third measure in deep drawing is the  thickness-to-diameter ratio   $t/D_{b}$  (thick- ness of the starting blank $t$  divided by the blank diameter $D_{b}$ ). Often expressed as  a percent, it is desirable for the  $\mathit{t}/D_{b}$  ratio to be greater than  $1\%$ . As  $\mathit{t}/D_{b}$  decreases,  tendency for wrinkling (Section 19.3.4) increases.  

In cases where these limits on drawing ratio, reduction, and  $\mathit{t}/D_{b}$  ratio are exceeded  by the design of the drawn part, the blank must be drawn in two or more steps, some- times with annealing between the steps.  

# Example 19.3  Cup drawing  

A drawing operation is used to form a cylindrical cup with inside diameter $=$ $75\,\mathrm{mm}$  and height $=50\:\mathrm{mm}$ . The starting blank size $=138\,\mathrm{mm}$  and the stock  thickness $=2.4\:\mathrm{mm}$ . Based on these data, is the operation feasible? As  $\mathit{t}/D_{b}$  decreases,  tendency for wrinkling (Section 19.3.4) increases.  

In cases where these limits on drawing ratio, reduction, and  $\mathit{t}/D_{b}$  ratio are exceeded  by the design of the drawn part, the blank must be drawn in two or more steps, some- times with annealing between the steps.  

# Example 19.3  Cup drawing  

A drawing operation is used to form a cylindrical cup with inside diameter $=$ $75\,\mathrm{mm}$  and height $=50\:\mathrm{mm}$ . The starting blank size $=138\,\mathrm{mm}$  and the stock  thickness $=2.4\:\mathrm{mm}$ . Based on these data, is the operation feasible?  

Solution:  To assess feasibility, the drawing ratio, reduction, and thickness-to- diameter ratio is determined.  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{D R=138/75=1.84}}\\ {{r=(138-75)/138=0.4565=45.65\%}}\\ {{t/D_{b}=2.4/138=0.017=1.7\%}}\end{array}
$$  

According to these measures, the drawing operation is feasible. The draw- ing ratio is less than 2.0, the reduction is less than $50\%$ , and the $t/D_{b}$  ratio is  greater than $1\%$ . These are general guidelines frequently used to indicate  technical feasibility.  

Forces  The  drawing force  required to perform a given operation can be estimated  roughly by the formula:  

$$
F=\pi D_{p}t\;(T S)\biggl(\frac{D_{b}}{D_{p}}-0.7\biggr)
$$  

where $F=$  drawing force, $\mathbf{N}\left(\mathbf{lb}\right)\!;t=$  original blank thickness, mm (in);  $T S=$  tensile  strength, MPa  $\left(1\mathbf{b}/\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ ; and  $D_{b}$  and  $D_{p}$  are the starting blank diameter and punch  diameter, respectively, mm (in). The constant 0.7 is a correction factor to account for  friction. Equation (19.12) estimates the maximum force in the operation. The draw- ing force varies throughout the downward movement of the punch, usually reaching  its maximum value at about one-third the length of the punch stroke.  

The  holding force  is an important factor in a drawing operation. As a rough  approximation, the holding pressure can be set at a value  $\,=\,0.015$  of the yield  strength of the sheet metal [9]. This value is then multiplied by that portion of the  starting area of the blank that is to be held by the blankholder. In equation form,  

$$
F_{h}=0.015Y\pi\{D_{b}^{2}-(D_{p}+2.2t+2R_{d})^{2}\}
$$
 }  

where  $F_{h}=$  holding force in drawing,  $\mathbf{N}$  (lb);  $Y=$  yield strength of the sheet metal,  MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $t=$  starting stock thickness, mm (in);  $R_{d}=$  die corner radius, mm (in);  and the other terms have been previously deﬁ  ned. The holding force is usually about  one-third the drawing force [10].  

# Example 19.4  Forces in deep  

For the drawing operation of Example 19.3, determine (a) drawing force and  (b) holding force, given that the tensile strength of the sheet metal (low-carbon  steel) $=300$  MPa and yield strength $=175$  MPa. The die corner radius  $=$   $6\,\mathrm{mm}$ .

# Effect of Manufacturing Processes  

The ability to achieve a certain tolerance or surface is a function of the manufactur-  ing process. This section describes the general capabilities of various processes in  terms of tolerance and surface roughness and surface integrity.  

Some manufacturing processes are inherently more accurate than others. Most  machining processes are quite accurate, capable of tolerances of  $\pm0.05\ \mathrm{mm}$   $(\pm0.002\$  in)  or better. By contrast, sand castings are generally inaccurate, and tolerances of 10 to 20  times those used for machined parts should be specified. In Table 5.4, we list a variety  

processes.

of manufacturing processes and indicate the typical tolerances for  each process. Toler- ances are based on the process capability for the  particular manufacturing operation, as defined in Section 40.2. The  tolerance that should be specified is a function of part size; larger  parts require more generous tolerances. The table lists tolerances for  moderately  sized parts in each processing category.  

The manufacturing process determines surface finish and surface  integrity. Some  processes are capable of producing better  surfaces than others. In general, process- ing cost increases  with improvement in surface finish. This is because additional  operations and more time are usually required to obtain increasingly  better surfaces.  Processes noted for providing superior finishes  include honing, lapping, polishing,  and superfinishing (Chapter  24). Table 5.5 indicates the usual surface roughness that  can be  expected from various manufacturing processes.

# 6.4 Superalloys  

Part II covers the four types of engineering materials:   (1) metals, (2) ceramics, (3) polymers, and (4) composites.  Metals are the most important engineering materials and  the topic of this chapter. In machining, the  material is removed by the mechanism of shear deformation (Section 20.2).  

The hardness of a material is deﬁ  ned as its resistance to permanent indentation.  Good hardness generally means that the material is resistant to scratching and wear.  For many engineering applications, including most of the tooling used in manufac- turing, scratch and wear resistance are important characteristics. As the reader shall  see later in this section, there is a strong correlation between hardness and strength.  

3.2.1  HARDNESS TESTS  

Hardness tests are commonly used for assessing material properties because they  are quick and convenient. However, a variety of testing methods are appropriate  because of differences in hardness among different materials. The best-known hard- ness tests are Brinell and Rockwell.  

Brinell Hardness Test  The Brinell hardness test is widely used for testing metals  and nonmetals of low- to medium hardness. It is named after the Swedish engineer  who developed it around 1900. In the test, a hardened steel (or cemented carbide)  ball of $10{\mathrm{-mm}}$  diameter is pressed into the surface of a specimen using a load of 500,  1500, or  $3000~\mathrm{kg}$ . The load is then divided into the indentation area to obtain the  Brinell Hardness Number (BHN). In equation form,  

$$
H B=\frac{2F}{\pi D_{b}(D_{b}-\sqrt{D_{b}^{2}-D_{i}^{2}})}
$$  

where  $H B\;=$ Brinell Hardness Number (BHN);  $F\,=$  indentation load, kg;  $D_{b}\,=$ diameter of the ball, mm; and $D_{i}=$  diameter of the indentation on the surface, mm.  

These dimensions are indicated in Figure 3.14(a). The resulting BHN has units  of $\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ , but the units are usually omitted in expressing the number. For harder  materials (above $500\:\mathrm{BHN}$ ), the cemented carbide ball is used because the steel ball  experiences elastic deformation that compromises the accuracy of the reading. Also,  higher loads (1500 and $3000\;\mathrm{kg}$ ) are typically used for harder materials. Because of  differences in results under different loads, it is considered good practice to indicate  the load used in the test when reporting $H B$  readings.  

Rockwell Hardness Test  This is another widely used test, named after the met- allurgist who developed it in the early 1920s. It is convenient to use, and several  enhancements over the years have made the test adaptable to a variety of materials.  

In the Rockwell Hardness Test, a cone-shaped indenter or small-diameter ball,  with diameter $=1.6$  or  $3.2~\mathrm{mm}$  (1/16 or 1/8 in) is pressed into the specimen using  a minor load of $10\,\mathrm{kg}$ , thus seating the indenter in the material. Then, a major load  of  $150~\mathrm{kg}$  (or other value) is applied, causing the indenter to penetrate into the

➢   Roll coating  is a mechanized technique in which a rotating roller is partially sub- mersed in a pan of liquid adhesive and picks up a coating of the adhesive, which  is then transferred to the work surface. Figure 30.14 shows one possible appli- cation, in which the work is a thin, ﬂ  exible material (e.g., paper, cloth, leather,  plastic). Variations of the method are used for coating adhesive onto wood, wood  composite, cardboard, and similar materials with large surface areas.  

Advantages and Limitations  Advantages of adhesive bonding are (1) the proc- ess is applicable to a wide variety of materials; (2) parts of different sizes and cross  sections can be joined—fragile parts can be joined by adhesive bonding; (3) bond- ing occurs over the entire surface area of the joint, rather than in discrete spots or  along seams as in fusion welding, thereby distributing stresses over the entire area;  (4) some adhesives are ﬂ  exible after bonding and are thus tolerant of cyclical load- ing and differences in thermal expansion of adherends; (5) low temperature curing  avoids damage to parts being joined; (6) sealing as well as bonding can be achieved;  and (7) joint design is often simpliﬁ  ed (e.g., two ﬂ  at surfaces can be joined without  providing special part features such as screw holes).  

Principal limitations of this technology include (1) joints are generally not as  strong as other joining methods; (2) adhesive must be compatible with materials  being joined; (3) service temperatures are limited; (4) cleanliness and surface prepa- ration prior to application of adhesive are important; (5) curing times can impose a  limit on production rates; and (6) inspection of the bonded joint is difﬁ  cult.

Various adhesives (Section 30.3) are used for afﬁ  xing components to  the board surface. Most common are epoxies and acrylics. The adhesive is applied by  one of three methods: (1) brushing liquid adhesive through a screen stencil; (2) using  an automatic dispensing machine with a programmable  $x$ - y  positioning system; or  (3) using a pin transfer method, in which a ﬁ  xture consisting of pins arranged accord- ing to where adhesive must be applied is dipped into the liquid adhesive and then  positioned onto the board surface to deposit adhesive in the required spots.  

Components are placed on the board by the same type of placement machines used  with the solder paste assembly method. After component placement, the adhesive  is cured. Depending on adhesive type, curing is by heat, ultraviolet (UV) light, or a  combination of UV and infrared (IR) radiation. With the surface-mount components  now bonded to the PCB surface, the board is put through wave soldering. The compo- nents themselves pass through the molten solder wave. Technical problems sometimes  encountered in SMT wave soldering include components uprooted from the board,  components shifting position, and larger components creating shadows that inhibit  proper soldering of neighboring components.  

# 34.3.2  THROUGH-HOLE TECHNOLOGY  

In printed circuit assemblies using through-hole technology, the lead pins must be  inserted into through-holes in the circuit board. Once inserted, the leads are soldered  into place in the holes in the board. In double-sided and multilayer boards, the hole  surfaces into which the leads are inserted are generally copper plated, giving rise to  the name  plated through-hole  for these cases. After soldering, the boards are cleaned  and tested, and those boards not passing the test are reworked if possible.  

Component Insertion  In component insertion, the leads of components are  inserted into their proper through-holes in the PCB. In PCB assemblies based  exclusively on through-hole technology (unusual today), a single board may be  populated with hundreds of separate components (DIPs, resistors, etc.), all of  which need to be inserted into the board. In modern electronic assembly plants,  most component insertions are accomplished by automatic insertion machines.  Components are loaded into these machines in the form of reels, magazines, or  other carriers that maintain proper orientation of the components until insertion.  A small proportion is done by hand for nonstandard components that cannot  be accommodated on automatic machines. These cases include switches and con- nectors as well as resistors, capacitors, and certain other components. Although  the proportion of component insertions accomplished manually is low, their cost  is high because of much lower cycle rates than automatic insertions. Industrial  robots (Section 37.4) are sometimes used to substitute for human labor in these  component insertion tasks.  

The insertion operation involves (1) preforming the leads, (2) insertion of leads  into the board holes, and then (3) cropping and clinching the leads on the other side  of the board. Preforming is needed only for some component types and involves  bending of leads that are initially straight into a U-shape for insertion. Many compo- nents come with properly shaped leads and require little or no preforming.  

Insertion is accomplished by a work head designed for the component type.  Components inserted by automatic machines are grouped into three basic  catego  ries: (a) axial lead, (b) radial lead, and (c) chip carrier (e.g., dual-in-line  package, Section 33.6.1). Typical axial and radial lead components are pictured  in Figure 34.11. Axial components are shaped like a cylinder, with leads project- ing from each end. Typical components of this type include resistors, capacitors,  and diodes. Their leads must be bent, as suggested in the ﬁ  gure, to be inserted.  Radial components have parallel leads and have various body shapes, one of  which is shown in Figure 34.11(b). This type of component includes light-emitting  diodes, potentiometers, resistor networks, and fuse holders. These conﬁ  gurations  are sufﬁ    ciently different that separate insertion machines with the appropriate

The slip mechanism requires more  time than twinning, which can occur almost instantaneously. Thus, when the  deformation rate is very high, metals twin that would otherwise slip.

# 2.3.4  GRAINS AND GRAIN BOUNDARIES IN METALS  

A given block of metal may contain millions of individual crystals, called  grains .  Each grain has its own unique lattice orientation; but collectively, the grains are ran-  domly oriented within the block. Such a structure is referred to as  polycrystalline . It  is easy to understand how such a structure is the natural state of the material. When  the block is cooled from the molten state and begins to solidify, nucleation of indi-  vidual crystals occurs at random positions and orientations throughout the liquid.  As  these crystals grow they finally interfere with each other, forming at their interface a  surface defect—a  grain boundary . The grain boundary consists of a transition zone,  perhaps only a few atoms thick, in which the atoms are not aligned with either grain.  The size of the grains in the metal block is determined by the number of nucleation  sites in the molten material and the cooling rate of the mass, among other factors. In  a casting process, the nucleation sites are often created by the relatively cold walls   of the mold, which motivates a somewhat preferred grain orientation at these walls.  

Grain size is inversely related to cooling rate: Faster cooling promotes smaller  grain size, whereas slower cooling has the opposite effect. Grain size is important  in metals because it affects mechanical properties. Smaller grain size is generally  preferable from a design viewpoint because it means higher strength and hard-  ness. It is also desirable in certain manufacturing operations (e.g., metal forming),  because it means higher ductility during deformation and a better surface on the  finished product.  

Another factor influencing mechanical properties is the presence of grain  boundaries in the metal. They represent imperfections in the crystalline structure  that interrupt the continued movement of dislocations. This helps to explain why  smaller grain size—therefore more grains and more grain boundaries—increases the  strength of the metal. By interfering with dislocation movement, grain boundaries  also contribute to the characteristic property of a metal to become stronger as it is  deformed. The property is called  strain hardening , and it is examined more closely  in Chapter 3 on mechanical properties.  

# Noncrystalline (Amorphous) Structures  

Many important materials are noncrystalline—liquids and gases, for example. Water  and air have noncrystalline structures. A metal loses its crystalline structure when  it is melted. Mercury is a liquid metal at room temperature, with its melting point  of $-38^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(-37^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ ). Important classes of engineering materials have a noncrystalline  form in their solid state; the term  amorphous  is often used to describe these materi-  als. Glass, many plastics, and rubber fall into this category. Many important plastics  are mixtures of crystalline and noncrystalline forms. Even metals can be amorphous  rather  than crystalline, given that the cooling rate during transformation from liquid to solid  is fast enough to inhibit the atoms from arranging themselves into their pre- ferred  regular patterns. This can happen, for instance, if the molten metal is poured  between cold, closely spaced, rotating rolls. In the  case of diamond, which is carbon (atomic number 6), each atom has four neighbors  with which it shares electrons. This produces a very rigid three-dimensional struc-  ture, not adequately represented in Figure 2.5(b), and accounts for the extreme high  hardness of this material. Other forms of carbon (e.g., graphite) do not exhibit this  rigid atomic structure. Solids with covalent bonding generally possess high hardness  and low electrical conductivity.  

The metallic bond is, of course, the atomic bonding mechanism in pure metals  and metal alloys. Atoms of the metallic elements generally possess too few elec-  trons in their outermost orbits to complete the outer shells for all of the atoms in,  say, a given block of metal. Accordingly, instead of sharing on an atom-to-atom  basis,  metallic bonding  involves the sharing of outer-shell electrons by all atoms  to form a general electron cloud that permeates the entire block. This cloud pro-  vides the attractive forces to hold the atoms together and form a strong, rigid  structure in most cases. Because of the general sharing of electrons, and their  freedom to move within the metal, metallic bonding provides for good electri- cal  conductivity. Other typical properties of materials characterized by metallic  bonding include good conduction of heat and good ductility. (Although some of  these terms are yet to be defined, the reader’s general understanding of material  properties is assumed.)  

Secondary Bonds  Whereas primary bonds involve atom-to-atom attractive forces,  secondary bonds involve attraction forces between molecules, or  inter molecular forces.  There is no transfer or sharing of electrons in secondary bonding, and these bonds are  

![](images/f8a43dd6721bf6b49d75837f0a72445fb13cfab69b7697138bdfa6ceb40e55c8.jpg)

therefore weaker than primary bonds. There are three forms of secondary bonding:   (a) dipole forces, (b) London forces, and (c) hydrogen bonding, illustrated in Figure 2.6.  Types (a) and (b) are often referred to as  van der Waals  forces, after the scientist who  first studied and quantified them.  

Dipole forces  arise in a molecule comprised of two atoms that have equal and  opposite electrical charges. Each molecule therefore forms a dipole, as shown in  Figure 2.6(a) for hydrogen chloride. Although the material is electrically neu- tral  in its aggregate form, on a molecular scale the individual dipoles attract each  other, given the proper orientation of positive and negative ends of the molecules.  These dipole forces provide a net intermolecular bonding within the material.  

London forces  involve attractive forces between nonpolar molecules; that is, the  atoms in the molecule do not form dipoles in the sense of the preceding paragraph.  However, owing to the rapid motion of the electrons in orbit around the molecule,  temporary dipoles form when more electrons happen to be on one side of the mole-  cule than the other, as suggested by Figure 2.6(b). These instantaneous dipoles pro-  vide a force of attraction between molecules in the material.  

Finally,  hydrogen bonding  occurs in molecules containing hydrogen atoms that  are  covalently bonded to another atom (e.g., oxygen in $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ ). Because the elec- trons  needed to complete the shell of the hydrogen atom are aligned on one side of  its nucleus, the opposite side has a net positive charge that attracts the electrons of  atoms in neighboring molecules. Hydrogen bonding is illustrated in Figure  2.6(c) for water, and is generally a stronger intermolecular bonding mechanism  than the other two forms of secondary bonding. It is important in the formation of  many polymers.

This part of the book covers those manufacturing  processes in which the starting work material is either  a liquid or is in a highly plastic condition, and a part  is created through solidiﬁ  cation of the material. Cast- ing and molding processes dominate this category of  shaping operations. With reference to Figure 10.1, the  solidiﬁ  cation processes can be classiﬁ  ed according to  the engineering material that is processed: (1) metals,  (2) ceramics, speciﬁ  cally glasses,  and (3) polymers and  polymer matrix composites (PMCs). Casting of metals  is covered in this and the following chapter. Glasswork- ing is covered in Chapter 12, and the processing of poly- mers and PMCs is treated in Chapters 13 and 14.  

Casting  is a process in which molten metal ﬂ  ows by  gravity or other force into a mold where it solidiﬁ  es in  the shape of the mold cavity. The term  casting  is also  applied to the part that is made by this process. It is one  of the oldest shaping processes, dating back 6000 years  (Historical Note 10.1). The principle of casting seems  simple: melt the metal, pour it into a mold, and let it  cool and solidify; yet there are many factors and vari- ables that must be considered in order to accomplish a  successful casting operation.  

Casting includes both the casting of ingots and the  casting of shapes. The term  ingot  is usually associ- ated with the primary metals industries; it describes a  large casting that is simple in shape and intended for

# Historical Note 10.1  Origins of casting  

Casting of metals can be traced back to around 4000  B . C . E . Gold was the ﬁ  rst metal to be discovered and  used by the early civilizations; it was malleable and  could be readily hammered into shape at room tem- perature. There seemed to be no need for other ways  to shape gold. It was the subsequent discovery of cop- per that gave rise to the need for casting. Although  copper could be forged to shape, the process was  more difﬁ  cult (due to strain hardening) and limited to  relatively simple forms. Historians believe that hun- dreds of years elapsed before the process of cast- ing copper was ﬁ  rst performed, probably by accident  during the reduction of copper ore in preparation for  hammering the metal into some useful form. Thus,  through serendipity, the art of casting was born. It is  likely that the discovery occurred in Mesopotamia, and  the “technology” quickly spread throughout the rest  of the ancient world.  

It was an innovation of signiﬁ  cant importance  in the history of mankind. Shapes much more intri- cate could be formed by casting than by hammering.  More sophisticated tools and weapons could be fab- ricated. More detailed implements and ornaments  could be fashioned. Fine gold jewelry could be made  more beautiful and valuable than by previous meth- ods. Alloys were ﬁ  rst used for casting when it was  discovered that mixtures of copper and tin (the alloy  thus formed was bronze) yielded much better cast- ings than copper alone. Ingot molds are made of high carbon iron and are tapered  at the top or bottom for removal of the solid casting. A  big-end-down mold  is illus-  trated in Figure 6.10. The cross section may be square, rectangular, or round, and the  perimeter is usually corrugated to increase surface area for faster cooling. The mold  is placed on a platform called a  stool ; after solidification the mold is lifted, leaving  the casting on the stool.  

The solidification process for ingots as well as other castings is described in  Chapter 10 on casting fundamentals. Because ingots are such large castings, the  time required for solidification and the associated shrinkage are significant. Porosity  caused by the reaction of carbon and oxygen to form CO during cooling and solidi-  fication is a problem that must be addressed in ingot casting. These gases are lib-  erated from the molten steel because of their reduced solubility with decreasing  temperature. Cast steels are often treated to limit or prevent CO gas evolution  

![](images/fe728790f624c54f3549ed527ba004c73eec767658fedc35bd38e7b11da98f85.jpg)  
FIGURE 6.10  A big-end-down ingot mold  typical of type used in steelmaking.  

during solidification. The treatment involves adding elements such as Si and Al that  react with the oxygen dissolved in the molten steel, so it is not available for CO  reaction. The structure of the solid steel is thus free of pores and other defects  caused by gas formation.  

Continuous Casting   Continuous casting is widely applied in aluminum and cop-  per production, but its most noteworthy application is in steelmaking. The process is  replacing ingot casting because it dramatically increases productivity. Ingot casting  is a discrete process. Because the molds are relatively large, solidification time is sig-  nificant. For a large steel ingot, it may take 10 to 12 hours for the casting to solidify.  The use of continuous casting reduces solidification time by an order of magnitude.  

The continuous casting process, also called  strand casting , is illustrated in  Figure 6.11. Molten steel is poured from a ladle into a temporary container called  a  tundish , which dispenses the metal to one or more continuous casting molds. The  steel begins to solidify at the outer regions as it travels down through the water-  cooled mold. Water sprays accelerate the cooling process. While still hot and plastic,  the metal is bent from vertical to horizontal orientation. It is then cut into sections  or fed continuously into a rolling mill (Section 18.1) in which it is formed into plate   or sheet stock or other cross sections.

As defined earlier,  Steel  is an alloy of iron that contains carbon ranging by weight  between $0.02\%$  and $2.11\%$  (most steels range between $0.05\%$  and $1.1\%\mathrm{~C~}$ ). It often  includes other alloying ingredients, such as manganese, chromium, nickel, and/or  molybdenum; but it is the carbon content that turns iron into steel. Hundreds of  compositions of steel are available commercially. For purposes of organization here,  the vast majority of commercially important steels can be grouped into the follow-  ing categories: (1) plain carbon steels, (2) low alloy steels, (3) stainless steels, (4) tool  steels, and (5) specialty steels.  

Plain Carbon Steels  These steels contain carbon as the principal alloying  element, with only small amounts of other elements (about  $0.4\%$  manganese plus  lesser amounts of silicon, phosphorus, and sulfur). The strength of plain carbon  steels increases with carbon content. A typical plot of the relationship is illustrated  in Figure 6.12.

#  Mechanical Energy Processes  

This section examines several of the nontraditional processes that use mechanical  energy other than a sharp cutting tool: (1) ultrasonic machining, (2) water jet processes,  and (3) other abrasive processes.  

# 25.1.1  ULTRASONIC MACHINING  

Ultrasonic machining (USM) is a nontraditional machining process in which abrasives  contained in a slurry are driven at high velocity against the work by a tool vibrating  at low amplitude and high frequency. The amplitudes are around $0.075\:\mathrm{mm}$  (0.003 in),  and the frequencies are approximately  $20{,}000~\mathrm{Hz}$ . The tool oscillates in a direction  perpendicular to the work surface, and is fed slowly into the work, so that the shape  of the tool is formed in the part. However, it is the action of the abrasives, impinging  against the work surface, that performs the cutting. The general arrangement of the  USM process is depicted in Figure 25.1.  

Common tool materials used in USM include soft steel and stainless steel. Abrasive  materials in USM include boron nitride, boron carbide, aluminum oxide, silicon carbide,  and diamond. Grit size (Section 16.1.1) ranges between 100 and 2000. The vibration  amplitude should be set approximately equal to the grit size, and the gap size should be  maintained at about two times grit size. To a signiﬁ  cant degree, grit size determines the  surface ﬁ  nish on the new work surface. In addition to surface ﬁ  nish, material removal  rate is an important performance variable in ultrasonic machining. For a given work  material, the removal rate in USM increases with increasing frequency and amplitude  of vibration.

The cutting action in USM operates on the tool as well as the work. As the abrasive  particles erode the work surface, they also erode the tool, thus affecting its shape. It is  therefore important to know the relative volumes of work material and tool material  removed during the process—similar to the grinding ratio (Section 25.1.2). This ratio  of stock removed to tool wear varies for different work materials, ranging from around  100:1 for cutting glass down to about 1:1 for cutting tool steel.  

The slurry in USM consists of a mixture of water and abrasive particles. Concentra- tion of abrasives in water ranges from $20\%$  to $60\%$  [5]. The slurry must be continuously  circulated to bring fresh grains into action at the tool–work gap. It also washes away  chips and worn grits created by the cutting process.  

The development of ultrasonic machining was motivated by the need to machine  hard, brittle work materials, such as ceramics, glass, and carbides. It is also success- fully used on certain metals such as stainless steel and titanium. Shapes obtained by  USM include nonround holes, holes along a curved axis, and coining operations, in  which an image pattern on the tool is imparted to a ﬂ  at work surface.  

# 25.1.2  PROCESSES USING WATER JETS  

The two processes described in this section remove material by means of high-velocity  streams of water or a combination of water and abrasives.  

Water Jet Cutting   Water jet cutting (WJC) uses a ﬁ  ne, high-pressure, high- velocity stream of water directed at the work surface to cause cutting of the work,  as illustrated in Figure 25.2. To obtain the ﬁ  ne stream of water a small nozzle  opening of diameter 0.1 to $0.4\:\mathrm{mm}$  (0.004–0.016 in) is used. Figure 20.4(b) shows a helical milling cutter used  in peripheral milling. Although the shape is quite different from a single-point tool,  many elements of tool geometry are similar. Single-point and multiple-cutting-edge  tools and the materials used in them are discussed in more detail in Chapter 22.  

Cutting Conditions  Relative motion is required between the tool and work to  perform a machining operation. The primary motion is accomplished at a certain  cutting speed   $\nu$ . In addition, the tool must be moved laterally across the work. This  is a much slower motion, called the  feed $f.$  The remaining dimension of the cut is the  penetration of the cutting tool below the original work surface, called the  depth of  cut   $d$ . Collectively, speed, feed, and depth of cut are called the  cutting conditions .  They form the three dimensions of the machining process, and for certain operations  (e.g., most single-point tool operations) they can be used to calculate the material  removal rate for the process:  

$$
R_{M R}=\nu f d
$$  

where $R_{M R}=$  material removal rate, $\mathrm{mm}^{3}/\mathrm{s}$   $(\mathrm{in}^{3}/\mathrm{min})$ ); $\nu=$  cutting speed,  $\mathrm{m/s}$  (ft/min),  which must be converted to  $\mathrm{mm/s}$   $(\mathrm{in}/\mathrm{min}$ ); $f\,{=}\,$  feed, mm (in); and  $d=$  depth of cut,  $\mathrm{mm}$  (in).

FIGURE 20.5  Cutting speed,  feed, and depth of cut for a  turning operation.  

The cutting conditions for a turning operation are depicted in Figure 20.5. Typical  units used for cutting speed are $\mathrm{m/s}$  (ft/min). Feed in turning is expressed in $\mathrm{mm/rev}$   (in/rev), and depth of cut is expressed in mm (in). In other machining operations,  interpretations of the cutting conditions may differ. For example, in a drilling opera- tion, depth is interpreted as the depth of the drilled hole.  

Machining operations usually divide into two categories, distinguished by pur- pose and cutting conditions: roughing cuts and ﬁ  nishing cuts.  Roughing  cuts are  used to remove large amounts of material from the starting work part as rapidly  as possible, in order to produce a shape close to the desired form, but leaving some  material on the piece for a subsequent ﬁ  nishing operation.  Finishing  cuts are used  to complete the part and achieve the ﬁ  nal dimensions, tolerances, and surface ﬁ  nish.  In production machining jobs, one or more roughing cuts are usually performed on  the work, followed by one or two ﬁ  nishing cuts. Roughing operations are performed  at high feeds and depths—feeds of $0.4{-}1.25\:\mathrm{mm/rev}$   $(0.015{-}0.050\ \mathrm{in}/\mathrm{rev})$  and depths  of  $2.5{-}20~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.100–0.750 in) are typical. Finishing operations are carried out at  low feeds and depths—feeds of  $0.125{-}0.4~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.005–0.015 in/rev) and depths of  $0.75{-}2.0\:\mathrm{mm}$  (0.030–0.075 in) are typical. Cutting speeds are lower in roughing than  in ﬁ  nishing.  

A  cutting ﬂ  uid  is often applied to the machining operation to cool and lubricate  the cutting tool. Cutting ﬂ  uids are discussed in Section 22.4. Determining whether  a cutting ﬂ  uid should be used, and, if so, choosing the proper cutting ﬂ  uid, is usually  included within the scope of cutting conditions.

# 22.3.2  MULTIPLE-CUTTING-EDGE TOOLS  

Most multiple-cutting-edge tools are used in machining operations in which the tool is  rotated. Primary examples are drilling and milling. On the other hand, broaching and  some sawing operations (hack sawing and band sawing) use multiple-cutting-edge  tools that operate with a linear motion. Other sawing operations (circular sawing) use  rotating saw blades.  

Drills  Various cutting tools are available for hole making, but the  twist drill  is by  far the most common. It comes in diameters ranging from about $0.15\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.006 in)  to as large as $75\,\mathrm{mm}$  (3.0 in). Twist drills are widely used in industry to produce holes  rapidly and economically.  

The standard twist drill geometry is illustrated in Figure 22.12. The body of the drill  has two spiral  ﬂ  utes  (the spiral gives the twist drill its name). The angle of the spiral  ﬂ  utes is called the  helix angle , a typical value of which is around  $30^{\mathrm{o}}$ . While drilling,  the ﬂ  utes act as passageways for extraction of chips from the hole. Although it is de- sirable for the ﬂ  ute openings to be large to provide maximum clearance for the chips,  the body of the drill must be supported over its length. This support is provided by the  web , which is the thickness of the drill between the ﬂ  utes.  

The point of the twist drill has a conical shape. A typical value for the  point angle   is  $118^{\circ}$ . The point can be designed in various ways, but the most common design is  a  chisel edge , as in Figure 22.12. Connected to the chisel edge are two cutting edges  (sometimes called lips) that lead into the ﬂ  utes. The portion of each ﬂ  ute adjacent to  the cutting edge acts as the rake face of the tool.  

The cutting action of the twist drill is complex. The rotation and feeding of the  drill bit result in relative motion between the cutting edges and the workpiece to  form the chips. The cutting speed along each cutting edge varies as a function of the  distance from the axis of rotation. Accordingly, the efﬁ  ciency of the cutting action  varies, being most efﬁ  cient at the outer diameter of the drill and least efﬁ  cient at the  center. In fact, the relative velocity at the drill point is zero, so no cutting takes place.  Instead, the chisel edge of the drill point pushes aside the material at the center as  it penetrates into the hole; a large thrust force is required to drive the twist drill for- ward into the hole. Also, at the beginning of the operation, the rotating chisel edge  tends to wander on the surface of the work part, causing loss of positional accuracy.  Various alternative drill point designs have been developed to address this problem.  

Chip removal can be a problem in drilling. The cutting action takes place inside  the hole, and the ﬂ  utes must provide sufﬁ  cient clearance throughout the length of

the drill to allow the chips to be extracted from the hole. As shown in the ﬁ  gure, the gun drill has a carbide cutting edge, a  single ﬂ  ute for chip removal, and a coolant hole running its complete length. In the  typical gun drilling operation, the work rotates around the stationary drill (opposite

of most drilling operations), and the coolant ﬂ  ows into the cutting process and out of  the hole along the ﬂ  ute, carrying the chips with it. Gun drills range in diameter from  less than $2\:\mathrm{mm}$  (0.075 in) to about  $50\,\mathrm{mm}$  (2 in).  

It was previously mentioned that twist drills are available with diameters up to  $75\,\mathrm{mm}$  (3 in). Twist drills that large are uncommon because so much metal is required  in the drill bit. An alternative for large diameter holes is the  spade drill , illustrated in  Figure 22.15. Standard sizes range from 25 to  $152\,\mathrm{mm}$  (1–6 in). The interchangeable  drill bit is held in a toolholder, which provides rigidity during cutting. The mass of the  spade drill is much less than a twist drill of the same diameter.  

More information on hole-making tools can be found in references [3] and [9].  

Milling Cutters  Classiﬁ  cation of milling cutters is closely associated with the mill- ing operations described in Section 21.4.1. The major types of milling cutters are the  following:  

➢   Plain milling cutters . These are used for peripheral or slab milling. As Figures  21.17(a) and 21.18(a) indicate, they are cylinder shaped with several rows of

teeth. The cutting edges are usually oriented at a helix angle (as in the ﬁ  gures)  to reduce impact on entry into the work, and these cutters are called  helical  milling cutters . Tool geometry elements of a plain milling cutter are shown in  Figure 22.16.  

$\gg$ Form milling cutters . These are peripheral milling cutters in which the cutting  edges have a special proﬁ  le that is to be imparted to the work, as in Figure  21.18(e). An important application is in gear making, in which the form milling  cutter is shaped to cut the slots between adjacent gear teeth, thereby leaving the  geometry of the gear teeth. ➢   Face milling cutters . These are designed with teeth that cut on both the periph- ery as well as the end of the cutter. Face milling cutters can be made of HSS,  as in Figure 21.17(b), or they can be designed to use cemented carbide inserts.  Figure 22.17 shows a four-tooth face-milling cutter that uses inserts.

The  headstock  contains the drive unit to rotate the spindle,  which rotates the work. Opposite the headstock is the  tailstock , in which a center is  mounted to support the other end of the workpiece.  

![](images/ed595687bb3fd9a1f8cdb7606bcbb50d129aceac0f6d6ffb748563290d217d5e.jpg)  
FIGURE 21.7  Diagram  of an engine lathe,  indicating its principal  components.  

The cutting tool is held in a  tool post  fastened to the  cross-slide , which is assembled  to the  carriage . The carriage is designed to slide along the  ways  of the lathe in order  to feed the tool parallel to the axis of rotation. The ways are like tracks along which  the carriage rides, and they are made with great precision to achieve a high degree  of parallelism relative to the spindle axis. The ways are built into the  bed  of the lathe,  providing a rigid frame for the machine tool.  

The carriage is driven by a leadscrew that rotates at the proper speed to obtain the  desired feed rate. The cross-slide is designed to feed in a direction perpendicular to  the carriage movement. Thus, by moving the carriage, the tool can be fed parallel to  the work axis to perform straight turning; or by moving the cross-slide, the tool can  be fed radially into the work to perform facing, form turning, or cutoff operations.  

The conventional engine lathe and most other machines described in this section are  horizontal turning machines ; that is, the spindle axis is horizontal. This is appropriate  for the majority of turning jobs, in which the length is greater than the diameter. For  jobs in which the diameter is large relative to length and the work is heavy, it is more  convenient to orient the work so that it rotates about a vertical axis; these are  vertical  turning machines .  

The size of a lathe is designated by swing and maximum distance between centers.  The  swing  is the maximum work part diameter that can be rotated in the spindle,  determined as twice the distance between the centerline of the spindle and the  ways of the machine. The actual maximum size of a cylindrical workpiece that  can be accommodated on the lathe is smaller than the swing because the carriage  and cross-slide assembly are in the way. The  maximum distance between centers   indicates the maximum length of a workpiece that can be mounted between head- stock and tailstock centers. For example, a  $350~\mathrm{mm}\times1.2~\mathrm{m}$ ( $14~\mathrm{in}\times48$  in) lathe  designates that the swing is  $350~\mathrm{mm}$  (14 in) and the maximum distance between  centers is $1.2\:\mathrm{m}$  (48 in).  

Methods of Holding the Work in a Lathe   There are four common methods  used to hold work parts in turning. These workholding methods consist of various  mechanisms to grasp the work, center and support it in position along the spindle  axis, and rotate it. The methods, illustrated in Figure 21.8, are (a) mounting the work  between centers, (b) chuck, (c) collet, and (d) face plate.  

Holding the work  between centers  refers to the use of two centers, one in the head- stock and the other in the tailstock, as in Figure 21.8(a). This method is appropriate  for parts with large length-to-diameter ratios. At the headstock center, a device called  a  dog  is attached to the outside of the work and is used to drive the rotation from the  spindle. The tailstock center has a cone-shaped point which is inserted into a tapered  hole in the end of the work. The tailstock center is either a “live” center or a “dead”  center. A  live center  rotates in a bearing in the tailstock, so that there is no relative  rotation between the work and the live center, hence, no friction between the center  and the workpiece. In contrast, a  dead center  is ﬁ  xed to the tailstock, so that it does  not rotate; instead, the workpiece rotates about it. Because of friction and the heat  buildup that results, this setup is normally used at lower rotational speeds. Accordingly, one or more milling heads are  substituted for the single-point cutting tools used on planers, and the motion of the  work past the tool is a feed rate motion rather than a cutting speed motion. Planer  mills are built to machine very large parts. The worktable and bed of the machine  are heavy and relatively low to the ground, and the milling heads are supported by a  bridge structure that spans across the table.  

A  tracer mill , also called a  proﬁ  ling mill , is designed to reproduce an irregular part  geometry that has been created on a template. Using either manual feed by a human  operator or automatic feed by the machine tool, a tracing probe is controlled to follow  the template while a milling head duplicates the path taken by the probe to machine  the desired shape. Tracer mills are of two types: (1)  x – y   tracing , in which the contour  of a ﬂ  at template is proﬁ  le milled using two-axis control; and (2)  x – y – z tracing , in  which the probe follows a three dimensional pattern using three-axis control. Tracer  mills have been used for creating shapes that cannot easily be generated by a simple  feeding action of the work against the milling cutter. Applications include molds and  dies. In recent years, many of these applications have been taken over by computer  numerical control (CNC) milling machines.

FIGURE 21.25  Simplex bed- type milling machine horizontal  spindle.  

CNC milling machines  are milling machines in which the cutter path is controlled  by alphanumerical data rather than a physical template. They are especially suited to  proﬁ  le milling, pocket milling, surface contouring, and die sinking operations, in which  two or three axes of the worktable must be simultaneously controlled to achieve the  required cutter path. An operator is normally required to change cutters as well as  load and unload work parts.  

#  Machining Centers and Turning Centers  

A  machining center , illustrated in Figure 21.26, is a highly automated machine tool  capable of performing multiple machining operations under computer numerical  control in one setup with minimal human attention. Workers are needed to load and  unload parts, which usually takes considerable less time than the machine cycle time,  so one worker may be able to tend more than one machine. Typical operations per- formed on a machining center are milling and drilling, which use rotating cutting tools. The typical features that distinguish a machining center from conventional machine  tools and make it so productive include:  

➢   Multiple operations in one setup . Most work parts require more than one operation  to completely machine the speciﬁ  ed geometry. Complex parts may require dozens  of separate machining operations, each requiring its own machine tool, setup, and  cutting tool. Machining centers are capable of performing most or all of the opera- tions at one location, thus minimizing setup time and production lead time.  

➢   Automatic tool changing . To change from one machining operation to the next, the  cutting tools must be changed. This is done on a machining center under CNC pro- gram control by an automatic tool-changer designed to exchange cutters between  the machine tool spindle and a  tool storage carousels . Capacities of these carousels

commonly range from 16 to 80 cutting tools. The machine in Figure 21.26 has two  storage carousels on the left side of the column.  

➢   Pallet shuttles . Some machining centers are equipped with pallet shuttles, which  are automatically transferred between the spindle position and the loading sta- tion, as shown in Figure 21.26. Parts are ﬁ  xtured on pallets that are attached to  the shuttles. In this arrangement, the operator can be unloading the previous  part and loading the next part while the machine tool is engaged in machining  the current part.

As the ﬂ  ash begins to form  in the die gap, friction resists continued ﬂ  ow of metal into the gap, thus constrain- ing the bulk of the work material to remain in the die cavity. In hot forging, metal  ﬂ  ow is further restricted because the thin ﬂ  ash cools quickly against the die plates,  thereby increasing its resistance to deformation. Restricting metal ﬂ  ow in the gap  causes the compression pressures on the part to increase signiﬁ  cantly, thus forc- ing the material to ﬁ  ll the sometimes intricate details of the die cavity to ensure a  high-quality product.  

Several forming steps are often required in impression die forging to transform  the starting blank into the desired ﬁ  nal geometry. Separate cavities in the die are  needed for each step. The beginning steps are designed to redistribute the metal in  the work part to achieve a uniform deformation and desired metallurgical struc- ture in the subsequent steps. The ﬁ  nal steps bring the part to its ﬁ  nal geometry. In  addition, when drop forging is used, several blows of the hammer may be required  for each step. When impression-die drop forging is done manually, as it often is,  considerable operator skill is required under adverse conditions to achieve con- sistent results.  

Because of ﬂ  ash formation in impression die forging and the more complex part  shapes made with these dies, forces in this process are signiﬁ  cantly greater and more  difﬁ  cult to analyze than in open-die forging. Relatively simple formulas and design  factors are often used to estimate forces in impression-die forging. The force formula  is the same as previous Equation (18.16) for open-die forging, but its interpretation  is slightly different:  

$$
\textstyle F=K_{f}Y_{f}A
$$  

where  $F=$  maximum force in the operation,  $\mathbf{N}$  (lb);  $A\,=$ projected area of the  part including ﬂ  ash, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}$   $(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ );  $Y_{f}=$  ﬂ  ow stress of the material, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ; and  $K_{f}=$  forging shape factor. In hot forging, the appropriate value of  $Y_{f}$  is the yield

strength of the metal at the elevated temperature. In other cases, selecting the  proper value of ﬂ  ow stress is difﬁ  cult because the strain varies throughout the  workpiece for complex shapes.  $K_{f}$  in Equation (18.18) is a factor intended to  account for increases in force required to forge part shapes of various complexi- ties. Table 18.1 indicates the range of values of  $K_{f}$ for different part geometries.  Obviously, the problem of specifying the proper  $K_{f}$ value for a given work part  limits the accuracy of the force estimate.  

Equation (18.18) applies to the maximum force during the operation, since this  is the load that will determine the required capacity of the press or hammer used in  the operation. The maximum force is reached at the end of the forging stroke, when  the projected area is greatest and friction is maximum.  

Impression-die forging is not capable of close tolerance work, and machining  is often required to achieve the accuracies needed. The basic geometry of the  part is obtained from the forging process, with machining performed on those  portions of the part that require precision ﬁ  nishing (e.g., holes, threads, and sur- faces that mate with other components). The advantages of forging, compared  to machining the part completely, are higher production rates, conservation of  metal, greater strength, and favorable grain orientation of the metal that results  from forging. A comparison of the grain ﬂ  ow in forging and machining is illus- trated in Figure 18.15. Shapes generated by open-die operations are simple; examples include  shafts, disks, and rings. In some applications, the dies have slightly contoured sur- faces that help to shape the work. In addition, the work must often be manipu- lated (e.g., rotating in steps) to effect the desired shape change. Skill of the human  operator is a factor in the success of these operations. An example of open-die  forging in the steel industry is the shaping of a large square cast ingot into a round  cross section. Open-die forging operations produce rough forms, and subsequent  operations are required to reﬁ  ne the parts to ﬁ  nal geometry and dimensions. An  important contribution of open-die hot-forging is that it creates a favorable grain  ﬂ  ow and metallurgical structure in the metal.

FIGURE 18.13  Several open-die forging operations: (a) fullering, (b) edging, and (c) cogging.  

Operations classiﬁ  ed as open-die forging or related operations include fuller- ing, edging, and cogging, illustrated in Figure 18.13.  Fullering  is a forging operation  performed to reduce the cross section and redistribute the metal in a work part in  preparation for subsequent shape forging. It is accomplished by dies with convex  surfaces. Fullering die cavities are often designed into multi-cavity impression dies,  so that the starting bar can be rough formed before ﬁ  nal shaping.  Edging  is similar  to fullering, except that the dies have concave surfaces.  

A  cogging  operation consists of a sequence of forging compressions along the  length of a workpiece to reduce cross section and increase length. It is used in the  steel industry to produce blooms and slabs from cast ingots. It is accomplished using  open dies with ﬂ  at or slightly contoured surfaces. The term  incremental forging  is  sometimes used for this process.  

# 18.3.2  IMPRESSION-DIE FORGING  

Impression-die forging, sometimes called  closed-die forging , is performed with  dies that contain the inverse of the desired shape of the part. The process is  illustrated in a three-step sequence in Figure 18.14. The raw workpiece is shown  as a cylindrical part similar to that used in the previous open-die operation. As  the die closes to its ﬁ  nal position, ﬂ  ash is formed by metal that ﬂ  ows beyond the  die cavity and into the small gap between the die plates. Although this ﬂ  ash must

be cut away from the part in a subsequent trimming operation, it actually serves  an important function during impression-die forging. As the ﬂ  ash begins to form  in the die gap, friction resists continued ﬂ  ow of metal into the gap, thus constrain- ing the bulk of the work material to remain in the die cavity. In hot forging, metal  ﬂ  ow is further restricted because the thin ﬂ  ash cools quickly against the die plates,  thereby increasing its resistance to deformation. Restricting metal ﬂ  ow in the gap  causes the compression pressures on the part to increase signiﬁ  cantly, thus forc- ing the material to ﬁ  ll the sometimes intricate details of the die cavity to ensure a  high-quality product.

#  Other Mechanical Fastening Methods  

In addition to the mechanical assembly techniques discussed above, there are sev- eral additional methods that involve the use of fasteners. These include stitching,  stapling, sewing, and cotter pins.  

Stitching, Stapling, and Sewing   Industrial stitching and stapling are similar oper- ations involving the use of U-shaped metal fasteners.  Stitching  is a fastening operation  in which a stitching machine is used to form the U-shaped stitches one at a time from  steel wire and immediately drive them through the two parts to be joined. Figure 31.15  illustrates several types of wire stitches. The parts to be joined must be relatively thin,  consistent with the stitch size, and the assembly can involve various combinations of  metal and nonmetal materials. Applications of industrial stitching include light sheet- metal assembly, metal hinges, electrical connections, magazine binding, corrugated  boxes, and ﬁ  nal product packaging. Conditions that favor stitching in these applica- tions are (1) high-speed operation, (2) elimination of the need for prefabricated holes  in the parts, and (3) desirability of using fasteners that encircle the parts.  

In  stapling , preformed U-shaped staples are punched through the two parts to  be attached. The staples are supplied in convenient strips. The individual staples are  lightly stuck together to form the strip, but they can be separated by the stapling tool  for driving. The staples come with various point styles to facilitate their entry into the  work. Staples are usually applied by means of portable pneumatic guns, into which  strips containing several hundred staples can be loaded. Applications of industrial sta- pling include: furniture and upholstery, assembly of car seats, and various light-gage  sheet-metal and plastic assembly jobs.  

Sewing  is a common joining method for soft, ﬂ  exible parts such as cloth and  leather. The method involves the use of a long thread or cord interwoven with the

parts so as to produce a continuous seam between them. The process is widely used  in the needle trades industry for assembling garments.  

Cotter Pins   Cotter pins are fasteners formed from half-round wire into a single  two-stem pin, as in Figure 31.16. They vary in diameter, ranging between  $0.8\ \mathrm{mm}$   (0.031 in) and $19\,\mathrm{mm}\,(3/4\,\mathrm{in})$ , and in point style, several of which are shown in the ﬁ  g- ure. Cotter pins are inserted into holes in the mating parts and their legs are split to  lock the assembly. They are used to secure parts onto shafts and similar applications.  

#  Molding Inserts and Integral Fasteners  

These assembly methods form a permanent joint between parts by shaping or re- shaping one of the components through a manufacturing process such as casting,  molding, or sheet-metal forming. Rearranging Equation 31.10 to solve for the cooling  temperature,  

$$
T_{2}={\frac{(D2-D_{1})}{\alpha\,D_{1}}}+\,T_{1}={\frac{(30.00-0.03)-30.015}{12(10^{-6})(30.015)}}+20=-124.9+20=-104.9^{\circ}{\bf C}
$$  

(b) From Table 3.1, the modulus of elasticity for steel  $E=209(10^{3})$  MPa. Using Equation (31.5) to solve for radial pressure, where  $D_{c}=50.00\,\mathrm{mm}$  and  $D_{p}=30.025\:\mathrm{mm}$  

$$
P_{f}={\frac{E i(D_{c}^{2}-D_{p}^{2})}{D_{p}D_{c}^{2}}}={\frac{209(10^{3})(0.015)(50^{2}-30.015^{2})}{30.015(50^{2})}}=66.8\ \mathrm{MPa}
$$  

(c) The maximum effective stress is given by Equation 31.8:  

$$
\mathbf{Max}\:\sigma_{e}={\frac{2p_{f}D_{c}^{2}}{D_{c}^{2}\!-\!D_{p}^{2}}}={\frac{2(66.8)(50^{2})}{(50^{2}\!-\!30.015^{2})}}={\mathbf{209}}\:\mathbf{MHz}
$$  

Snap Fits and Retaining Rings   Snap ﬁ  ts are a variation of interference ﬁ  ts. A  snap ﬁ  t  involves joining two parts in which the mating elements possess a tempo- rary interference while being pressed together, but once assembled they interlock  to maintain the assembly. A typical example is shown in Figure 31.13: as the parts  are pressed together, the mating elements elastically deform to accommodate the  interference, subsequently allowing the parts to snap together; once in position,  the elements become connected mechanically so that they cannot easily be disas- sembled. The parts are usually designed so that a slight interference exists after  assembly.  

Advantages of snap ﬁ  t assembly include (1) the parts can be designed with self- aligning features, (2) no special tooling is required, and (3) assembly can be accom- plished very quickly. Snap ﬁ  tting was originally conceived as a method that would  be ideally suited to industrial robotics applications; however, it is no surprise that  assembly techniques that are easier for robots are also easier for human assembly  workers.

FIGURE 31.14  Retaining ring assem- bled into a groove on a  shaft.  

A  retaining ring , also known as a  snap ring , is a fastener that snaps into a circum- ferential groove on a shaft or tube to form a shoulder, as in Figure 31.14. The assembly  can be used to locate or restrict the movement of parts mounted on the shaft. Retain- ing rings are available for both external (shaft) and internal (bore) applications. They  are made from either sheet metal or wire stock, heat treated for hardness and stiff- ness.

The most important line defect is the  dislocation , which can take two  forms: (a) edge dislocation and (b) screw dislocation. An  edge dislocation  is the edge  of an extra plane of atoms that exists in the lattice, as illustrated in Figure 2.10(a).  A  screw dislocation , Figure 2.10(b), is a spiral within the lattice structure wrapped  around an imperfection line, like a screw is wrapped around its axis. Both types of  dislocations can arise in the crystal structure during solidification (e.g., casting), or  they can be initiated during a deformation process (e.g., metal forming) performed  on the solid material. Dislocations are useful in explaining certain aspects of me-  chanical behavior in metals.  

Surface defects  are imperfections that extend in two directions to form a boundary.  The  most obvious example is the external surface of a crystalline object that defines its  shape. The surface is an interruption in the lattice structure. Surface boundaries can  also lie inside the material. Grain boundaries are the best example of these in- ternal  surface interruptions. Metallic grains are discussed in a moment, but first let  consider how deformation occurs in a crystal lattice, and how the process is aided by  the presence of dislocations.  

# 2.3.3  DEFORMATION IN METALLIC CRYSTALS  

When a crystal is subjected to a gradually increasing mechanical stress, its initial  response is to deform  elastically . This can be likened to a tilting of the lattice struc-  ture without any changes of position among the atoms in the lattice, in the manner  depicted in Figure 2.11(a) and (b). If the force is removed, the lattice structure (and  therefore the crystal) returns to its original shape. If the stress reaches a high value  relative to the electrostatic forces holding the atoms in their lattice positions, a per-  manent shape change occurs, called  plastic deformation . What has happened is that  the atoms in the lattice have permanently moved from their previous locations, and  a new equilibrium lattice has been formed, as suggested by Figure 2.11(c).  

![](images/0d9aabf1cc01b4d825f9cb88be43a3087a1384dbd5a0144323c778ca20613527.jpg)  
FIGURE 2.11   Deformation of a crystal structure: (a) original lattice; (b) elastic deformation,  with no permanent change in positions of atoms; and (c) plastic deformation, in which atoms  in the lattice are forced to move to new “homes.”  

The lattice deformation shown in (c) of the figure is one possible mechanism, called  slip, by which plastic deformation can occur in a crystalline structure. The other is  called twinning, discussed later.  

Slip  involves the relative movement of atoms on opposite sides of a plane in the  lattice, called the  slip plane . The slip plane must be somehow aligned with the lattice  structure (as indicated in the sketch), and so there are certain preferred directions  along which slip is more likely to occur. The number of these  slip directions  de-  pends on the lattice type. The three common metal crystal structures are somewhat  more complicated, especially in three dimensions, than the square lattice depicted in  Figure  2.11. It turns out that HCP has the fewest slip directions, BCC the most, and FCC  falls in between. HCP metals show poor ductility and are generally difficult to  deform at room temperature. Metals with BCC structure would figure to have the  highest ductility, if the number of slip directions were the only criterion. However,  nature is not so simple. These metals are generally stronger than the others, which  complicates the issue, and the BCC metals usually require higher stresses to cause  slip. In fact, some of the BCC metals exhibit poor ductility. Low carbon steel is a  notable exception; although relatively strong, it is widely used with great commer-  cial success in sheet-metal-forming operations, where it exhibits good ductility. The  FCC metals are generally the most ductile of the three crystal structures, combining  a good number of slip directions with (usually) relatively low to moderate strength.  All three of these metal structures become more ductile at elevated temperatures,  and this fact is often exploited in shaping them. When a metal (or other material) changes structure like this, it is referred to as  being  allotropic .

# 2.3.2  IMPERFECTIONS   IN   CRYSTALS  

Thus far, crystal structures have been discussed as if they were perfect—the unit cell  repeated in the material over and over in all directions. A perfect crystal is sometimes  desirable to satisfy aesthetic or engineering purposes. For instance, a perfect dia- mond  (contains no flaws) is more valuable than one containing imperfections. In the  production of integrated circuit chips, large single crystals of silicon possess desirable  processing characteristics for forming the microscopic details of the circuit pattern.  

However, there are various reasons why a crystal’s lattice structure may not  be perfect. The imperfections often arise naturally because of the inability of the  solidifying material to continue the replication of the unit cell indefinitely without  interruption. Grain boundaries in metals are an example. In other cases, the imper-  fections are introduced purposely during the manufacturing process, for example,  the addition of an alloying ingredient in a metal to increase its strength.  

The various imperfections in crystalline solids are also called defects. Either term,  imperfection  or  defect , refers to deviations in the regular pattern of the crystalline  lattice structure. They can be catalogued as (1) point defects, (2) line defects, and   (3) surface defects.  

Point defects  are imperfections in the crystal structure involving either a single  atom or a few atoms. The defects can take various forms including, as shown in  Figure 2.9: (a)  vacancy , the simplest defect, involving a missing atom within the  lattice structure; (b)  ion-pair vacancy , also called a  Schottky defect , which involves

a missing pair of ions of opposite charge in a compound that has an overall charge  balance; (c)  interstitialcy , a lattice distortion produced by the presence of an extra  atom in the structure; and (d)  displaced ion , known as a  Frenkel defect , which oc-  curs when an ion becomes removed from a regular position in the lattice structure  and inserted into an interstitial position not normally occupied by such an ion.  

A  line defect  is a connected group of point defects that forms a line in the lat-  tice structure. The most important line defect is the  dislocation , which can take two  forms: (a) edge dislocation and (b) screw dislocation. An  edge dislocation  is the edge  of an extra plane of atoms that exists in the lattice, as illustrated in Figure 2.10(a).

This figure provides a more realistic view of chip formation, showing shear zones rather than a shear plane."",",Figure 20.8 shows the different shear zones involved in chip formation during a machining process.,"First, the shear deformation process does not occur  along a plane, but within a zone. If shearing were to take place across a plane of  zero thickness, it would imply that the shearing action must occur instantaneously  as it passes through the plane, rather than over some ﬁ  nite (although brief) time  period. For the material to behave in a realistic way, the shear deformation must  occur within a thin shear zone. This more realistic model of the shear deformation  process in machining is illustrated in Figure 20.8. Metal-cutting experiments have  indicated that the thickness of the shear zone is only a few thousandths of an inch.  Since the shear zone is so thin, there is not a great loss of accuracy in most cases by  referring to it as a plane.  

Second, in addition to shear deformation that occurs in the shear zone, another  shearing action occurs in the chip after it has been formed. This additional shear is  referred to as secondary shear to distinguish it from primary shear. Secondary shear  results from friction between the chip and the tool as the chip slides along the rake

face of the tool. Its effect increases with increased friction between the tool and chip.  The primary and secondary shear zones can be seen in Figure 20.8.  

Third, formation of the chip depends on the type of material being machined and  the cutting conditions of the operation. Four basic types of chip can be distinguished,  illustrated in Figure 20.9:  

$\gg$ Discontinuous chip . When relatively brittle materials (e.g., cast irons) are  machined at low cutting speeds, the chips often form into separate segments  (sometimes the segments are loosely attached). This tends to impart an irregu- lar texture to the machined surface. High tool–chip friction and large feed and  depth of cut promote the formation of this chip type.  

$\gg$ Continuous chip . When ductile work materials are cut at high speeds and  relatively small feeds and depths, long continuous chips are formed. A good  surface ﬁ  nish typically results when this chip type is formed. A sharp cutting  edge on the tool and low tool–chip friction encourage the formation of con- tinuous chips. Long, continuous chips (as in turning) can cause problems with  regard to chip disposal and/or tangling about the tool. To solve these prob- lems, turning tools are often equipped with chip breakers (Section 22.3.1).

FIGURE 20.9  Four types of chip formation in metal cutting: (a) discontinuous, (b) continuous, (c) continuous with  built-up edge, (d) serrated.  

➢   Continuous chip with built-up edge . When machining ductile materials at low- to-medium cutting speeds, friction between tool and chip tends to cause por- tions of the work material to adhere to the rake face of the tool near the cutting  edge. This formation is called a built-up edge (BUE). The formation of a BUE is  cyclical; it forms and grows, then becomes unstable and breaks off. Much of the  detached BUE is carried away with the chip, sometimes taking portions of the  tool rake face with it, which reduces the life of the cutting tool. Portions of the  detached BUE that are not carried off with the chip become imbedded in the  newly created work surface, causing the surface to become rough.  

The preceding chip types were ﬁ  rst classiﬁ  ed by Ernst in the late 1930s [13]. Since  then, the available metals used in machining, cutting tool materials, and cutting  speeds have all increased, and a fourth chip type has been identiﬁ  ed:  

➢   Serrated chips  (the term  shear-localized  is also used for this fourth chip type). This formation is called a built-up edge (BUE). The formation of a BUE is  cyclical; it forms and grows, then becomes unstable and breaks off. Much of the  detached BUE is carried away with the chip, sometimes taking portions of the  tool rake face with it, which reduces the life of the cutting tool.

➢   Serrated chips  (the term  shear-localized  is also used for this fourth chip type).  These chips are semi-continuous in the sense that they possess a saw-tooth  appearance that is produced by a cyclical chip formation of alternating high  shear strain followed by low shear strain. This fourth type of chip is most closely  associated with certain difﬁ  cult-to-machine metals such as titanium alloys,  nickel-base superalloys, and austenitic stainless steels when they are machined  at higher cutting speeds. However, the phenomenon is also found with more  common work metals (e.g., steels) when they are cut at high speeds [13].  

#  Force Relationships and the Merchant Equation  

Several forces can be deﬁ  ned relative to the orthogonal cutting model. Based on  these forces, shear stress, coefﬁ  cient of friction, and certain other relationships can  be deﬁ  ned.  

# 20.3.1  FORCES IN METAL CUTTING  

Consider the forces acting on the chip during orthogonal cutting in Figure 20.10(a).  The forces applied against the chip by the tool can be separated into two mutually  perpendicular components: friction force and normal force to friction. The  friction  force $F$  is the frictional force resisting the ﬂ  ow of the chip along the rake face of the  tool. The  normal force to friction $N$  is perpendicular to the friction force. These two  components can be used to deﬁ  ne the coefﬁ  cient of friction between the tool and  the chip:  

$$
\mu={\frac{F}{N}}
$$  

The friction force and its normal force can be added vectorially to form a resultant  force $R$ , which is oriented at an angle $\beta$ , called the friction angle. The friction angle  is related to the coefﬁ  cient of friction as  

$$
\mu=\tan\beta
$$

FIGURE 20.10  Forces in metal cutting: (a) forces acting on the chip in orthogonal cutting, and (b) forces acting on  the tool that can be measured.  

In addition to the tool forces acting on the chip, there are two force components  applied by the workpiece on the chip: shear force and normal force to shear. The  shear force $F_{s}$  is the force that causes shear deformation to occur in the shear plane,  and the  normal force to shear $F_{n}$  is perpendicular to the shear force. Using the shear  force, the shear stress that acts along the shear plane between the work and the chip  can be deﬁ  ned:  

$$
\tau=\frac{F_{s}}{A_{s}}
$$  

where $A_{s}=$  area of the shear plane. This shear plane area can be calculated as  

$$
A_{s}=\frac{t_{o}w}{\sin\!\phi}
$$  

The shear stress in Equation (20.7) represents the level of stress required to per- form the machining operation. Therefore, this stress is equal to the shear strength of  the work material  $(\tau=S)$ ) under the conditions at which cutting occurs.  

Vector addition of the two force components  $F_{s}$  and  $F_{n}$  yields the resultant force  $R^{\prime}$ . In order for the forces acting on the chip to balance, this resultant  $R^{\prime}$  must be  equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and collinear with the resultant  $R$ .

A common example involves squeezing the  barrel of an electrical terminal onto a wire (Section 34.5.1).  

Design for assembly (DFA) has received much attention in recent years because  assembly operations constitute a high labor cost for many manufacturing compa- nies. The key to successful design for assembly can be simply stated [3]: (1) design  the product with as few parts as possible, and (2) design the remaining parts so they  are easy to assemble. The cost of assembly is determined largely during product  design, because that is when the number of separate components in the product  is determined, and decisions are made about how these components will be as- sembled. Once these decisions have been made, there is little that can be done in  manufacturing to inﬂ  uence assembly costs (except, of course, to manage the opera- tions well).  

This section considers some of the principles that can be applied during product  design to facilitate assembly. Most of the principles have been developed in the con- text of mechanical assembly, although some of them apply to the other assembly and  joining processes. Much of the research in design for assembly has been motivated  by the increasing use of automated assembly systems in industry. Accordingly, our  discussion is divided into two sections, the ﬁ  rst dealing with general principles of  DFA, and the second concerned speciﬁ  cally with design for automated assembly.  

# 31.6.1  GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DFA  

Most of the general principles apply to both manual and automated assembly. Their  goal is to achieve the required design function by the simplest and lowest cost means.  The following recommendations have been compiled from [1], [3], [4], and [6]:  

$\gg$ Use the fewest number of parts possible to reduce the amount of assembly re- quired  . This principle is implemented by combining functions within the same  part that might otherwise be accomplished by separate components (e.g., using  a plastic molded part instead of an assembly of sheet metal parts).

 ➢   Reduce the number of threaded fasteners required  . Instead of using separate  threaded fasteners, design the component to utilize snap ﬁ  ts, retaining rings,  integral fasteners, and similar fastening mechanisms that can be accomplished  more rapidly. Use threaded fasteners only where justiﬁ  ed (e.g., where disassem- bly or adjustment is required).

 ➢   Standardize fasteners . This is intended to reduce the number of sizes and styles  of fasteners required in the product. Ordering and inventory problems are  reduced, the assembly worker does not have to distinguish between so many  

![](images/0662ec93c77d53246c3edd552639fb259915abffb506e762af8730d605c076c6.jpg)  
FIGURE 31.19  Symmetrical parts are  generally easier to  insert and assemble:  (a) only one rotational  orientation possible for  insertion; (b) two possi- ble orientations; (c) four  possible orientations;  and (d) inﬁ  nite rotational  orientations.  

separate fasteners, the workstation is simpliﬁ  ed, and the variety of separate fas- tening tools is reduced.  

➢   Reduce parts orientation difﬁ  culties  . Orientation problems are generally re- duced by designing a part to be symmetrical and minimizing the number of  asymmetric features. This allows easier handling and insertion during assembly.  This principle is illustrated in Figure 31.19.

 ➢   Avoid parts that tangle  . Certain part conﬁ  gurations are more likely to become  entangled in parts bins, frustrating assembly workers or jamming automatic  feeders. Parts with hooks, holes, slots, and curls exhibit more of this tendency  than parts without these features (see Figure 31.20).  

# 31.6.2  DESIGN FOR AUTOMATED ASSEMBLY  

Methods suitable for manual assembly are not necessarily the best methods for  automated assembly. Some assembly operations readily performed by a human  worker are quite difﬁ  cult to automate (e.g., assembly using bolts and nuts). To auto- mate the assembly process, parts fastening methods must be speciﬁ  ed during prod- uct design that lend themselves to machine insertion and joining techniques and  do not require the senses, dexterity, and intelligence of human assembly workers. Capability to  orient the workhead  makes this a ﬁ  ve-axis  machine. (Courtesy of  Cincinnati Milacron.)  

commonly range from 16 to 80 cutting tools. The machine in Figure 21.26 has two  storage carousels on the left side of the column.  

➢   Pallet shuttles . Some machining centers are equipped with pallet shuttles, which  are automatically transferred between the spindle position and the loading sta- tion, as shown in Figure 21.26. Parts are ﬁ  xtured on pallets that are attached to  the shuttles. In this arrangement, the operator can be unloading the previous  part and loading the next part while the machine tool is engaged in machining  the current part. Nonproductive time on the machine is thereby reduced.   Automatic work part positioning . Many machining centers have more than  three axes. One of the additional axes is often designed as a rotary table to posi- tion the part at some speciﬁ  ed angle relative to the spindle. The rotary table per- mits the cutter to perform machining on four sides of the part in a single setup.  

Machining centers are classiﬁ  ed as horizontal, vertical, or universal. The designation  refers to spindle orientation. Horizontal machining centers (HMCs) normally machine  cube-shaped parts, in which the four vertical sides of the cube can be accessed by the  cutter. Vertical machining centers (VMCs) are suited to ﬂ  at parts on which the tool  can machine the top surface. Universal machining centers have workheads that swivel  their spindle axes to any angle between horizontal and vertical, as in Figure 21.26.  

Success of CNC machining centers led to the development of CNC turning centers. A  modern  CNC turning center , Figure 21.27, is capable of performing various turning and  related operations, contour turning, and automatic tool indexing, all under computer con- trol. In addition, the most sophisticated turning centers can accomplish (1) work part gag- ing (checking key dimensions after machining), (2) tool monitoring (sensors to indicate

when the tools are worn), (3) automatic tool changing when tools become worn, and  even (4) automatic work part changing at the completion of the work cycle [14].  

Another type of machine tool related to machining centers and turning centers is  the  CNC mill-turn center . This machine has the general conﬁ  guration of a turning  center; in addition, it can position a cylindrical work part at a speciﬁ  ed angle so that  a rotating cutting tool (e.g., milling cutter) can machine features into the outside  surface of the part, as illustrated in Figure 21.28. An ordinary turning center does not  have the capability to stop the work part at a deﬁ  ned angular position, and it does  not possess rotating tool spindles.  

Further progress in machine tool technology has taken the mill-turn center one  step further by integrating additional capabilities into a single machine. The addi- tional capabilities include (1) combining milling, drilling, and turning with grind- ing, welding, and inspection operations, all in one machine tool; (2) using multiple  spindles simultaneously, either on a single workpiece or two different workpieces;  and (3) automating the part handling function by adding industrial robots to the  machine [2], [20]. The terms  multitasking machine  and  multifunction machine  are  sometimes used for these machine tools.

"""Q1"": ""Is there a figure that explains the effect of temperature and time on the hardness of an alloy during the aging process?"",","""A1"": ""Yes. Figure 26.6 demonstrates the effect of temperature and time during the precipitation treatment (aging) on the hardness of an alloy. It shows two curves: (a) represents high precipitation temperature, where hardness peaks in a relatively short time, and (b) represents lower precipitation temperature, where more time is required to harden the alloy, but its maximum hardness is likely to be greater.""",Figure 26.6 explains the effect of temperature and time on the hardness of an alloy during the aging process.,"![](images/4cd53fe53dbab8fce7892af8aeac5f6caebc89b6d00986e805f31964f6ee4b3b.jpg)  

The necessary condition that determines whether an alloy system can be strength- ened by precipitation hardening is the presence of a sloping solvus line, as shown in  the phase diagram of Figure 26.5(a). A composition that can be precipitation hard- ened is one that contains two phases at room temperature, but which can be heated to  a temperature that dissolves the second phase. Composition C satisﬁ  es this require- ment. The heat treatment process consists of three steps, illustrated in Figure 26.5(b):  (1)  solution treatment , in which the alloy is heated to a temperature  $T_{s}$  above the  solvus line into the alpha phase region and held for a period sufﬁ  cient to dissolve the  beta phase; (2)  quenching  to room temperature to create a supersaturated solid solu- tion; and (3)  precipitation treatment , in which the alloy is heated to a temperature  $T_{p}$ , below  $T_{s}$ , to cause precipitation of ﬁ  ne particles of the beta phase. This third step  is called  aging , and for this reason the whole heat treatment is sometimes called  age  hardening . However, aging can occur in some alloys at room temperature, and so the  term  precipitation hardening  seems more precise for the three-step heat treatment  process under discussion here. When the aging step is performed at room tempera- ture, it is called  natural aging . When it is accomplished at an elevated temperature,  as in the ﬁ  gure, the term  artiﬁ  cial aging  is often used.  

It is during the aging step that high strength and hardness are achieved in the  alloy. The combination of temperature and time during the precipitation treat- ment (aging) is critical in bringing out the desired properties in the alloy. At higher  precipitation treatment temperatures, as in Figure 26.6(a), the hardness peaks in  a relatively short time; whereas at lower temperatures, as in (b), more time is re- quired to harden the alloy but its maximum hardness is likely to be greater than

in the ﬁ  rst case. As seen in the plot, continuation of the aging process results in a  reduction in hardness and strength properties, called  overaging . Its overall effect  is similar to annealing.  

#  Surface Hardening  

Surface hardening refers to any of several thermochemical treatments applied to  steels in which the composition of the part surface is altered by addition of carbon,  nitrogen, or other elements. The most common treatments are carburizing, nitriding,  and carbonitriding. These processes are commonly applied to low carbon steel parts  to achieve a hard, wear-resistant outer shell while retaining a tough inner core. The  term  case hardening  is often used for these treatments.  

Carburizing  is the most common surface-hardening treatment. It involves heat- ing a part of low carbon steel in the presence of a carbon-rich environment so that C  is diffused into the surface. In effect the surface is converted to a high carbon steel,  capable of higher hardness than the low-C core. The carbon-rich environment can be  created in several ways. One method involves the use of carbonaceous materials such  as charcoal or coke packed in a closed container with the parts. This process, called  pack carburizing , produces a relatively thick layer on the part surface, ranging from  around 0.6 to $4\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.025–0.150 in). Another method, called  gas carburizing , uses  hydrocarbon fuels such as propane  $\left(\mathrm{C}_{3}\mathrm{H}_{8}\right)$  inside a sealed furnace to diffuse carbon  into the parts. The case thickness in this treatment is thin, 0.13 to $0.75\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.005 to  0.030 in). ![](images/7a2acd8c0059871045a5029092841e8a6bcc9661020cf1031d2b6c60e676156d.jpg)

# 26.2.3  HARDENABILITY  

Hardenability refers to the relative capacity of a steel to be hardened by transforma- tion to martensite. It is a property that determines the depth below the quenched  surface to which the steel is hardened, or the severity of the quench required to  achieve a certain hardness penetration. Steels with good hardenability can be hard- ened more deeply below the surface and do not require high cooling rates. Harden- ability does not refer to the maximum hardness that can be attained in the steel; that  depends on the carbon content.  

The hardenability of a steel is increased through alloying. Alloying elements  having the greatest effect are chromium, manganese, molybdenum (and nickel, to  a lesser extent). The mechanism by which these alloying ingredients operate is to  extend the time before the start of the austenite-to-pearlite transformation in the  TTT diagram. In effect, the TTT curve is moved to the right, thus permitting slower  quenching rates during quenching. Therefore, the cooling trajectory is able to follow  a less hastened path to the $M_{s}$  line, more easily avoiding the nose of the TTT curve.  

The most common method for measuring hardenability is the  Jominy end-quench  test . The test involves heating a standard specimen of diameter  $=25.4\;\mathrm{mm}$  (1.0 in)  and length $=102\;\mathrm{mm}$  (4.0 in) into the austenite range, and then quenching one end  with a stream of cold water while the specimen is supported vertically as shown  in Figure 26.4(a). The cooling rate in the test specimen decreases with increased  distance from the quenched end. Hardenability is indicated by the hardness of the  specimen as a function of distance from quenched end, as in Figure 26.4(b).  

#  Precipitation Hardening  

Precipitation hardening involves the formation of ﬁ  ne particles (precipitates) that act  to block the movement of dislocations and thus strengthen and harden the metal. It  is the principal heat treatment for strengthening alloys of aluminum, copper, magne- sium, nickel, and other nonferrous metals. Precipitation hardening can also be used to  strengthen certain steel alloys. When applied to steels, the process is called  maraging

 (an abbreviation of martensite and aging), and the steels are called maraging steels 

 (Section 6.2.3).

Smaller lenses  are usually made by pressing, discussed above.  

# 12.2.2  SHAPING OF FLAT AND TUBULAR GLASS  

Two methods for making plate glass and one method for producing tube stock are  described here. They are continuous processes, in which long sections of ﬂ  at window  glass or glass tubing are made and later cut into appropriate sizes and lengths. They  are modern technologies in contrast to the ancient method described in Historical  Note 12.1.  

# Historical Note 12.1  Ancient methods of making ﬂ  at glass  [7]  

Glass windows have been used in buildings for many  centuries. The oldest process for making ﬂ  at window  glass was by manual glass blowing. The procedure  consisted of the following: (1) a glass globe was blown  on a blowpipe; (2) a portion of the globe was made  to stick to the end of a “punty, ” a metal rod used by  glassblowers, and then detached from the blowpipe;  and (3) after reheating the glass, the punty was rotated  with sufﬁ  cient speed for centrifugal force to shape the  open globe into a ﬂ  at disk. The disk, whose maximum  possible size was only about  $1\,\mathrm{~m~}$  (3 ft), was later cut  into small panes for windows.  

At the center of the disk, where the glass was  attached to the punty during the third step in the  process, a lump would tend to form that had the ap- pearance of a crown. The name “crown glass” was  derived from this resemblance. Lenses for spectacles  were ground from glass made by this method. Today,  the name crown glass is still used for certain types  of optical and ophthalmic glass, even though the an- cient method has been replaced by modern produc- tion technology.  

Rolling of Flat Plate  Flat plate glass can be produced by rolling, as illustrated in  Figure 12.6. The starting glass, in a suitably plastic condition from the furnace, is  squeezed through opposing rolls whose separation determines the thickness of the  sheet. The rolling operation is usually set up so that the ﬂ  at glass is moved directly  into an annealing furnace. The rolled glass sheet must later be ground and polished  for parallelism and smoothness.

FIGURE 12.7  The ﬂ  oat  process for producing  sheet glass.  

Float Process  This process was developed in the late 1950s. Its advantage over  other methods such as rolling is that it obtains smooth surfaces that need no sub- sequent ﬁ  nishing. A gob of molten glass is dropped into  a conical mold made of steel. The mold is rotated so that centrifugal force causes  the glass to ﬂ  ow upward and spread itself on the mold surface. The faceplate (i.e.,  the front viewing screen) is later assembled to the funnel using a sealing glass of low  melting point.  

Pressing  This is a widely used process for mass producing glass pieces such as dishes,  bake ware, headlight lenses, TV tube faceplates, and similar items that are relatively  ﬂ  at. The process is illustrated and described in Figure 12.3. The large quantities of most  pressed products justify a high level of automation in this production sequence.  

Blowing  Several shaping sequences include blowing as one or more of the steps.  Instead of a manual operation, blowing is performed on highly automated equip- ment. The two sequences described here are the press-and-blow and blow-and-blow  methods.  

As the name indicates, the  press-and-blow  method is a pressing operation fol- lowed by a blowing operation, as portrayed in Figure 12.4. The process is suited to

The se- quence is similar to the preceding, except that two (or more) blowing operations are  used rather than pressing and blowing. There are variations to the process, depend- ing on the geometry of the product, with one possible sequence shown in Figure 12.5.

The other two catego- ries are surveyed in the following paragraphs. In addition, there is the technology of  applying paints, varnishes, lacquers, and other similar coatings (Section 27.6).  

Planar coating  is used to coat fabrics, paper, cardboard, and metal foil; these  items are major products for some plastics. The important polymers include poly- ethylene and polypropylene, with lesser applications for nylon, PVC, and polyester.  In most cases, the coating is only 0.01 to  $0.05~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.0005–0.002 in) thick. The two  major planar coating techniques are illustrated in Figure 13.19. In the  roll method ,

the polymer coating material is squeezed against the substrate by means of opposing  rolls. In the  doctor blade method , a sharp knife edge controls the amount of polymer  melt that is coated onto the substrate. In both cases, the coating material is supplied  either by a slit-die extrusion process or by calendering.  

Contour coating  of three-dimensional objects can be accomplished by dipping or  spraying.  Dipping  involves submersion of the object into a suitable bath of polymer  melt or solution, followed by cooling or drying.  Spraying  (such as spray-painting) is  an alternative method for applying a polymer coating to a solid object.  

#  Injection Molding  

Injection molding is a process in which a polymer is heated to a highly plastic state  and forced to ﬂ  ow under high pressure into a mold cavity, where it solidiﬁ  es. The  molded part, called a  molding , is then removed from the cavity. The process pro- duces discrete components that are almost always net shape. The production cycle  time is typically in the range of 10 to 30 sec, although cycles of  $1\;\mathrm{{min}}$  or longer are  not uncommon for large parts. Also, the mold may contain more than one cavity,  so that multiple moldings are produced each cycle. A collection of plastic injection  moldings is displayed in Figure 13.20.  

Complex and intricate shapes are possible with injection molding. The challenge  in these cases is to fabricate a mold whose cavity is the same geometry as the part  and that also allows for part removal. Part size can range from about $50\;\mathrm{g}\;(2\;\mathrm{or})$  up  to about $25~\mathrm{kg}$  (more than $50\,\mathrm{lb}$ ), the upper limit represented by components such  as refrigerator doors and automobile bumpers. The mold determines the part shape  and size and is the special tooling in injection molding. For large, complex parts, the  mold can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. For small parts, the mold can be  built to contain multiple cavities, also making the mold expensive. Thus, injection  molding is economical only for large production quantities.

Injection molding is the most widely used molding process for thermoplastics.  Some thermosets and elastomers are injection molded, with modiﬁ  cations in equip- ment and operating parameters to allow for cross-linking of these materials. These  and other variations of injection molding are discussed in Section 13.6.5. (Some die construction  details are simpliﬁ  ed.)

# 13.2.4  DEFECTS IN EXTRUSION  

A number of defects can afﬂ  ict extruded products. One of the worst is  melt frac- ture , in which the stresses acting on the melt immediately before and during its  ﬂ  ow through the die are so high as to cause failure, manifested in the form of a  highly irregular surface on the extrudate. As suggested by Figure 13.12, melt frac- ture can be caused by a sharp reduction at the die entrance, causing turbulent ﬂ  ow  that breaks up the melt. This contrasts with the streamlined, laminar ﬂ  ow in the  gradually converging die in Figure 13.8.  

A more common defect in extrusion is  sharkskin , in which the surface of the  product becomes roughened upon exiting the die. As the melt ﬂ  ows through the die  opening, friction at the interface results in a velocity proﬁ  le across the cross section,  Figure 13.13. Tensile stresses develop at the surface as this material is stretched to  keep up with the faster moving center core. These stresses cause minor ruptures that  roughen the surface. If the velocity gradient becomes extreme, prominent marks  occur on the surface, giving it the appearance of a bamboo pole; hence, the name  bambooing  for this more severe defect.

#  Production of Sheet and Film  

Thermoplastic sheet and ﬁ  lm are produced by a number of processes, most  important of which are two methods based on extrusion. The term  sheet  refers to  stock with a thickness ranging from  $0.5~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.020 in) to about  $12.5~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.5 in)  and used for products such as ﬂ  at window glazing and stock for thermoforming  (Section 13.9).  Film  refers to thicknesses below $0.5\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.020 in). Thin ﬁ  lms are  used for packaging (product wrapping material, grocery bags, and garbage bags);  thicker ﬁ  lm applications include covers and liners (pool covers and liners for  irrigation ditches).  

All of the processes covered in this section are continuous, high-production oper- ations. More than half of the ﬁ  lms produced today are polyethylene, mostly low- density PE. The principal other materials are polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, and  regenerated cellulose (cellophane). These are all thermoplastic polymers.  

Slit-Die Extrusion of Sheet and Film   Sheet and ﬁ  lm of various thicknesses are  produced by conventional extrusion, using a narrow slit as the die opening. The slit  may be up to $3\;\mathrm{m}$  (10 ft) wide and as narrow as around  $0.4~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.015 in). One pos- sible die conﬁ  guration is illustrated in Figure 13.14. The die includes a manifold that  spreads the polymer melt laterally before it ﬂ  ows through the slit (die oriﬁ  ce). One  of the difﬁ  culties in this extrusion method is uniformity of thickness throughout  the width of the stock. This is caused by the drastic shape change experienced by

Each  worker may operate more than one machine in the cell, as suggested in the ﬁ  gure,  and the tasks are assigned to workers so that their workloads are balanced and the  production cycle time is consistent with the demand rate for the part.

Station B produces more than one part style, per- haps for several other downstream stations in addition to C. The scheduling of work  is determined by the order in which the production kanbans are placed on the rack.  

The kanban pull system between stations A and B and between stations C and D  operates the same as it does between stations B and C, described here. This system  of production control avoids unnecessary paperwork. The cards are used over and  over rather than generating new production and transport orders every cycle. An  apparent disadvantage is the considerable labor involvement in material handling  (moving the cards and containers between stations); however, it is claimed that this  promotes teamwork and cooperation among workers.  

Workforce and Supplier Base  Another requirement of a JIT production sys- tem is workers who are cooperative, committed, and capable of performing multiple  tasks. The workers must be ﬂ  exible to produce a variety of part styles at their respec- tive stations, to inspect the quality of their work, and to deal with minor technical  problems with the production equipment so that major breakdowns do not occur.  

Just-in-time extends to the suppliers of the company, who are held to the same stand- ards of on-time delivery, zero defects, and other JIT requisites as the company itself.  Some of the vendor policies used by companies to implement JIT include (1) reducing  the total number of suppliers, (2) selecting suppliers with proven records for meeting  quality and delivery standards, (3) establishing long-term partnerships with suppliers,  and (4) selecting suppliers that are located near the company’s manufacturing plant.  

Just-in-time delivery systems are an important aspect of lean production, which is  focused on reducing waste in production operations, and just-in-time reduces the  waste of too much inventory.  Lean production  can be deﬁ  ned as “an adaptation of  mass production in which workers and work cells are made more ﬂ  exible and efﬁ  - cient by adopting methods that reduce waste in all forms.” 4  Its origins are traced to  the Toyota Production System at Toyota Motors in Japan starting in the 1950s (His- torical Note 39.1). Although its initial applications were in the automotive industry,  the objective of minimizing waste is important in all industries.  

# H istorical  N ote  39.1   Toyota Production System and lean production [7]  

Taiichi Ohno (1912–1990) is the man credited with  president at Toyota Motors when the company was  developing the Toyota Production System in Japan  struggling to overcome the war’s devastating im- following World War II. He was an engineer and vice  pact on the Japanese automobile industry. The auto  

market in Japan in the 1950s was much smaller than  in the United States, so American mass production  techniques could not be used. Ohno recognized that  Toyota’s plants had to operate on a much smaller  scale and be more ﬂ  exible. The situation, as well as  his own aversion to waste, motivated him to develop  some of the procedures of the Toyota Production  System to reduce waste and increase efﬁ  ciency and  product quality. He and his colleagues experiment- ed with and perfected the procedures over several  decades, including just-in-time delivery, the kanban  system, setup time reduction, and control of product  quality.  

Ohno did not use the term “lean production” to  refer to his system. In fact, he died before the term  came into prominence, so he may never have heard  of it. In his book, he called it the “Toyota Production  System” [12].  The term  lean production  was coined by  researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technol- ogy to refer to the techniques and procedures used at  Toyota that explained its success in producing so ef- ﬁ  ciently cars with such high quality. The research was  known as the International Motor Vehicle Program and  documented in the book  The Machine that Changed  the  World  (published in 1991).  The term lean production  appeared in the book’s subtitle.  

In effect, lean production means accomplishing more work with fewer resources by  eliminating waste in manufacturing operations. Activities in manufacturing can be clas- siﬁ  ed into three categories: (1) actual work activities that add value such as processing  steps that alter the product in a positive way, (2) auxiliary work activities that support  the actual work such as loading and unloading a production machine, and (3) wasteful  activities that do not add value and do not support the value-adding activities.

The  headstock  contains the drive unit to rotate the spindle,  which rotates the work. Opposite the headstock is the  tailstock , in which a center is  mounted to support the other end of the workpiece.

FIGURE 21.7  Diagram  of an engine lathe,  indicating its principal  components.  

The cutting tool is held in a  tool post  fastened to the  cross-slide , which is assembled  to the  carriage . The carriage is designed to slide along the  ways  of the lathe in order  to feed the tool parallel to the axis of rotation. The ways are like tracks along which  the carriage rides, and they are made with great precision to achieve a high degree  of parallelism relative to the spindle axis. The ways are built into the  bed  of the lathe,  providing a rigid frame for the machine tool.  

The carriage is driven by a leadscrew that rotates at the proper speed to obtain the  desired feed rate. The cross-slide is designed to feed in a direction perpendicular to  the carriage movement. Thus, by moving the carriage, the tool can be fed parallel to  the work axis to perform straight turning; or by moving the cross-slide, the tool can  be fed radially into the work to perform facing, form turning, or cutoff operations.  

The conventional engine lathe and most other machines described in this section are  horizontal turning machines ; that is, the spindle axis is horizontal. This is appropriate  for the majority of turning jobs, in which the length is greater than the diameter. For  jobs in which the diameter is large relative to length and the work is heavy, it is more  convenient to orient the work so that it rotates about a vertical axis; these are  vertical  turning machines .  

The size of a lathe is designated by swing and maximum distance between centers.  The  swing  is the maximum work part diameter that can be rotated in the spindle,  determined as twice the distance between the centerline of the spindle and the  ways of the machine. The actual maximum size of a cylindrical workpiece that  can be accommodated on the lathe is smaller than the swing because the carriage  and cross-slide assembly are in the way. The  maximum distance between centers   indicates the maximum length of a workpiece that can be mounted between head- stock and tailstock centers. For example, a  $350~\mathrm{mm}\times1.2~\mathrm{m}$ ( $14~\mathrm{in}\times48$  in) lathe  designates that the swing is  $350~\mathrm{mm}$  (14 in) and the maximum distance between  centers is $1.2\:\mathrm{m}$  (48 in).  

Methods of Holding the Work in a Lathe   There are four common methods  used to hold work parts in turning. These workholding methods consist of various  mechanisms to grasp the work, center and support it in position along the spindle  axis, and rotate it. The methods, illustrated in Figure 21.8, are (a) mounting the work  between centers, (b) chuck, (c) collet, and (d) face plate.  

Holding the work  between centers  refers to the use of two centers, one in the head- stock and the other in the tailstock, as in Figure 21.8(a). This method is appropriate  for parts with large length-to-diameter ratios. At the headstock center, a device called  a  dog  is attached to the outside of the work and is used to drive the rotation from the  spindle. The tailstock center has a cone-shaped point which is inserted into a tapered  hole in the end of the work. The tailstock center is either a “live” center or a “dead”  center. A  live center  rotates in a bearing in the tailstock, so that there is no relative  rotation between the work and the live center, hence, no friction between the center  and the workpiece. In contrast, a  dead center  is ﬁ  xed to the tailstock, so that it does  not rotate; instead, the workpiece rotates about it. Because of friction and the heat  buildup that results, this setup is normally used at lower rotational speeds. Accordingly, one or more milling heads are  substituted for the single-point cutting tools used on planers, and the motion of the  work past the tool is a feed rate motion rather than a cutting speed motion. Planer  mills are built to machine very large parts. The worktable and bed of the machine  are heavy and relatively low to the ground, and the milling heads are supported by a  bridge structure that spans across the table.  

A  tracer mill , also called a  proﬁ  ling mill , is designed to reproduce an irregular part  geometry that has been created on a template. Using either manual feed by a human  operator or automatic feed by the machine tool, a tracing probe is controlled to follow  the template while a milling head duplicates the path taken by the probe to machine  the desired shape. Tracer mills are of two types: (1)  x – y   tracing , in which the contour  of a ﬂ  at template is proﬁ  le milled using two-axis control; and (2)  x – y – z tracing , in  which the probe follows a three dimensional pattern using three-axis control. Tracer  mills have been used for creating shapes that cannot easily be generated by a simple  feeding action of the work against the milling cutter. Applications include molds and  dies. In recent years, many of these applications have been taken over by computer  numerical control (CNC) milling machines.

FIGURE 21.25  Simplex bed- type milling machine horizontal  spindle.  

CNC milling machines  are milling machines in which the cutter path is controlled  by alphanumerical data rather than a physical template. They are especially suited to  proﬁ  le milling, pocket milling, surface contouring, and die sinking operations, in which  two or three axes of the worktable must be simultaneously controlled to achieve the  required cutter path. An operator is normally required to change cutters as well as  load and unload work parts.  

#  Machining Centers and Turning Centers  

A  machining center , illustrated in Figure 21.26, is a highly automated machine tool  capable of performing multiple machining operations under computer numerical  control in one setup with minimal human attention. Workers are needed to load and  unload parts, which usually takes considerable less time than the machine cycle time,  so one worker may be able to tend more than one machine. Typical operations per- formed on a machining center are milling and drilling, which use rotating cutting tools. The typical features that distinguish a machining center from conventional machine  tools and make it so productive include:  

➢   Multiple operations in one setup . Most work parts require more than one operation  to completely machine the speciﬁ  ed geometry. Complex parts may require dozens  of separate machining operations, each requiring its own machine tool, setup, and  cutting tool. Machining centers are capable of performing most or all of the opera- tions at one location, thus minimizing setup time and production lead time.  

➢   Automatic tool changing . To change from one machining operation to the next, the  cutting tools must be changed. This is done on a machining center under CNC pro- gram control by an automatic tool-changer designed to exchange cutters between  the machine tool spindle and a  tool storage carousels . Capacities of these carousels

commonly range from 16 to 80 cutting tools. The machine in Figure 21.26 has two  storage carousels on the left side of the column.  

➢   Pallet shuttles . Some machining centers are equipped with pallet shuttles, which  are automatically transferred between the spindle position and the loading sta- tion, as shown in Figure 21.26. Parts are ﬁ  xtured on pallets that are attached to  the shuttles. In this arrangement, the operator can be unloading the previous  part and loading the next part while the machine tool is engaged in machining  the current part.

The  swing  is the maximum work part diameter that can be rotated in the spindle,  determined as twice the distance between the centerline of the spindle and the  ways of the machine. The actual maximum size of a cylindrical workpiece that  can be accommodated on the lathe is smaller than the swing because the carriage  and cross-slide assembly are in the way. The  maximum distance between centers   indicates the maximum length of a workpiece that can be mounted between head- stock and tailstock centers. For example, a  $350~\mathrm{mm}\times1.2~\mathrm{m}$ ( $14~\mathrm{in}\times48$  in) lathe  designates that the swing is  $350~\mathrm{mm}$  (14 in) and the maximum distance between  centers is $1.2\:\mathrm{m}$  (48 in).

A  tracer mill , also called a  proﬁ  ling mill , is designed to reproduce an irregular part  geometry that has been created on a template. Using either manual feed by a human  operator or automatic feed by the machine tool, a tracing probe is controlled to follow  the template while a milling head duplicates the path taken by the probe to machine  the desired shape. Tracer mills are of two types: (1)  x – y   tracing , in which the contour  of a ﬂ  at template is proﬁ  le milled using two-axis control; and (2)  x – y – z tracing , in  which the probe follows a three dimensional pattern using three-axis control. Tracer  mills have been used for creating shapes that cannot easily be generated by a simple  feeding action of the work against the milling cutter. Applications include molds and  dies. In recent years, many of these applications have been taken over by computer  numerical control (CNC) milling machines.

CNC milling machines  are milling machines in which the cutter path is controlled  by alphanumerical data rather than a physical template. They are especially suited to  proﬁ  le milling, pocket milling, surface contouring, and die sinking operations, in which  two or three axes of the worktable must be simultaneously controlled to achieve the  required cutter path. An operator is normally required to change cutters as well as  load and unload work parts.  

#  Machining Centers and Turning Centers  

A  machining center , illustrated in Figure 21.26, is a highly automated machine tool  capable of performing multiple machining operations under computer numerical  control in one setup with minimal human attention. Workers are needed to load and  unload parts, which usually takes considerable less time than the machine cycle time,  so one worker may be able to tend more than one machine. Typical operations per- formed on a machining center are milling and drilling, which use rotating cutting tools. The typical features that distinguish a machining center from conventional machine  tools and make it so productive include:  

➢   Multiple operations in one setup . Most work parts require more than one operation  to completely machine the speciﬁ  ed geometry. Complex parts may require dozens  of separate machining operations, each requiring its own machine tool, setup, and  cutting tool. Machining centers are capable of performing most or all of the opera- tions at one location, thus minimizing setup time and production lead time.  

➢   Automatic tool changing . To change from one machining operation to the next, the  cutting tools must be changed. This is done on a machining center under CNC pro- gram control by an automatic tool-changer designed to exchange cutters between  the machine tool spindle and a  tool storage carousels . Capacities of these carousels

➢   Pallet shuttles . Some machining centers are equipped with pallet shuttles, which  are automatically transferred between the spindle position and the loading sta- tion, as shown in Figure 21.26. Parts are ﬁ  xtured on pallets that are attached to  the shuttles. In this arrangement, the operator can be unloading the previous  part and loading the next part while the machine tool is engaged in machining  the current part.

The  headstock  contains the drive unit to rotate the spindle,  which rotates the work. Opposite the headstock is the  tailstock , in which a center is  mounted to support the other end of the workpiece.

FIGURE 21.7  Diagram  of an engine lathe,  indicating its principal  components.  

The cutting tool is held in a  tool post  fastened to the  cross-slide , which is assembled  to the  carriage . The carriage is designed to slide along the  ways  of the lathe in order  to feed the tool parallel to the axis of rotation. The ways are like tracks along which  the carriage rides, and they are made with great precision to achieve a high degree  of parallelism relative to the spindle axis. The ways are built into the  bed  of the lathe,  providing a rigid frame for the machine tool.  

The carriage is driven by a leadscrew that rotates at the proper speed to obtain the  desired feed rate. The cross-slide is designed to feed in a direction perpendicular to  the carriage movement. Thus, by moving the carriage, the tool can be fed parallel to  the work axis to perform straight turning; or by moving the cross-slide, the tool can  be fed radially into the work to perform facing, form turning, or cutoff operations.  

The conventional engine lathe and most other machines described in this section are  horizontal turning machines ; that is, the spindle axis is horizontal. This is appropriate  for the majority of turning jobs, in which the length is greater than the diameter. For  jobs in which the diameter is large relative to length and the work is heavy, it is more  convenient to orient the work so that it rotates about a vertical axis; these are  vertical  turning machines .  

The size of a lathe is designated by swing and maximum distance between centers.  The  swing  is the maximum work part diameter that can be rotated in the spindle,  determined as twice the distance between the centerline of the spindle and the  ways of the machine. The actual maximum size of a cylindrical workpiece that  can be accommodated on the lathe is smaller than the swing because the carriage  and cross-slide assembly are in the way. The  maximum distance between centers   indicates the maximum length of a workpiece that can be mounted between head- stock and tailstock centers. For example, a  $350~\mathrm{mm}\times1.2~\mathrm{m}$ ( $14~\mathrm{in}\times48$  in) lathe  designates that the swing is  $350~\mathrm{mm}$  (14 in) and the maximum distance between  centers is $1.2\:\mathrm{m}$  (48 in).  

Methods of Holding the Work in a Lathe   There are four common methods  used to hold work parts in turning. These workholding methods consist of various  mechanisms to grasp the work, center and support it in position along the spindle  axis, and rotate it. The methods, illustrated in Figure 21.8, are (a) mounting the work  between centers, (b) chuck, (c) collet, and (d) face plate.  

Holding the work  between centers  refers to the use of two centers, one in the head- stock and the other in the tailstock, as in Figure 21.8(a). This method is appropriate  for parts with large length-to-diameter ratios. At the headstock center, a device called  a  dog  is attached to the outside of the work and is used to drive the rotation from the  spindle. The tailstock center has a cone-shaped point which is inserted into a tapered  hole in the end of the work. The tailstock center is either a “live” center or a “dead”  center. A  live center  rotates in a bearing in the tailstock, so that there is no relative  rotation between the work and the live center, hence, no friction between the center  and the workpiece. In contrast, a  dead center  is ﬁ  xed to the tailstock, so that it does  not rotate; instead, the workpiece rotates about it. Because of friction and the heat  buildup that results, this setup is normally used at lower rotational speeds. Accordingly, one or more milling heads are  substituted for the single-point cutting tools used on planers, and the motion of the  work past the tool is a feed rate motion rather than a cutting speed motion. Planer  mills are built to machine very large parts. The worktable and bed of the machine  are heavy and relatively low to the ground, and the milling heads are supported by a  bridge structure that spans across the table.  

A  tracer mill , also called a  proﬁ  ling mill , is designed to reproduce an irregular part  geometry that has been created on a template. Using either manual feed by a human  operator or automatic feed by the machine tool, a tracing probe is controlled to follow  the template while a milling head duplicates the path taken by the probe to machine  the desired shape.

The figure illustrates how the motor drives the lead screw, which in turn moves the worktable along the axis of motion. This setup is crucial for precise positioning in numerical control (NC) systems.""",Figure 37.9 shows the arrangement of a motor and leadscrew in an NC positioning system.,"Consider how a simple positioning system, shown in Figure 37.9, might  operate. The system consists of a worktable on which a work part is ﬁ  xtured. The  purpose of the table is to move the part relative to a tool or work head. To accom- plish this purpose, the worktable is moved linearly by means of a rotating leadscrew  that is driven by a motor. For simplicity, only one axis is shown in the sketch. To pro- vide $x$ - y  capability, the system shown would be piggybacked on top of a second axis  perpendicular to the ﬁ  rst. The leadscrew has a certain pitch $p$ , $\mathrm{mm}/\AA$ thread (in/thread)  or mm/rev (in/rev). Thus, the table is moved a distance equal to the leadscrew pitch  for each revolution. The velocity at which the worktable moves is determined by the  rotational speed of the leadscrew.  

Two basic types of motion control are used in NC: (a) open loop and (b) closed  loop, as shown in Figure 37.10. The difference is that an open-loop system operates  without verifying that the desired position of the worktable has been achieved. A  closed-loop control system uses feedback measurement to verify that the position of  the worktable is indeed the location speciﬁ  ed in the program. Open-loop systems are  less expensive than closed-loop systems and are appropriate when the force resisting  the actuating motion is minimal, as in point-to-point drilling, for example. Closed- loop systems are normally speciﬁ  ed for machine tools that perform continuous path  operations such as milling or turning, in which the resisting forces can be signiﬁ  cant.

Open-Loop Positioning Systems  To turn the leadscrew, an open-loop  positioning system typically uses a stepping motor (a.k.a. stepper motor). In  NC, the stepping motor is driven by a series of electrical pulses generated by the  machine control unit. Each pulse causes the motor to rotate a fraction of one  revolution, called the step angle. The allowable step angles must conform to the  relationship  

$$
\alpha=\frac{360}{n_{s}}
$$  

where  $\alpha\,=$ step angle, degrees; and  $n_{s}=$  the number of step angles for the motor,  which must be an integer. The angle through which the motor shaft rotates is given  by  

$$
A_{m}=\alpha n_{p}
$$  

where $A_{m}=$  angle of motor shaft rotation, degrees; $n_{p}=$ number of pulses received  by the motor; and  $\alpha\,=$  step angle, here deﬁ  ned as degrees/pulse. Finally, the rota- tional speed of the motor shaft is determined by the frequency of pulses sent to the  motor:  

$$
N_{m}=\frac{60\,\alpha\,f_{p}}{360}
$$  

where $N_{m}=$  speed of motor shaft rotation, $\scriptstyle{\mathrm{rev/min}};f_{p}\;=$ frequency of pulses driving  the stepper motor, $\mathrm{Hz}$  (pulses/sec), the constant 60 converts pulses/sec to pulses/min;  the constant 360 converts degrees of rotation to full revolutions; and  $\alpha=$  step angle  of the motor, as before.  

The motor shaft drives the leadscrew that determines the position and veloc- ity of the worktable. The connection is often designed using a gear reduction to  increase the precision of table movement. However, the angle of rotation and  rotational speed of the leadscrew are reduced by this gear ratio. The motor shaft drives the leadscrew that determines the position and veloc- ity of the worktable. The connection is often designed using a gear reduction to  increase the precision of table movement. However, the angle of rotation and  rotational speed of the leadscrew are reduced by this gear ratio. The relationships  are as follows:  

$$
A_{m}=r_{g}A_{l s}
$$  

and  

$$
N_{m}=r_{g}N_{l s}
$$  

where $A_{m}$  and $N_{m}$  are the angle of rotation, degrees, and rotational speed, rev/min, of  the motor, respectively; $A_{l s}$  and $N_{l s}$  are the angle of rotation, degrees, and rotational  speed, $\mathrm{rev/min}$ , of the leadscrew, respectively; and  $r_{g}=$  gear reduction between the  motor shaft and the leadscrew; for example, a gear reduction of 2 means that the mo- tor shaft rotates through two revolutions for each rotation of the leadscrew.  

The linear position of the table in response to the rotation of the leadscrew de- pends on the leadscrew pitch $p$ , and can be determined as follows:  

$$
x=\frac{p A_{l s}}{360}
$$  

where $x=x$ -axis position relative to the starting position, ${\mathrm{mm~(in)}};p=$ pitch of the  leadscrew, mm/rev (in/rev); and $A_{l s}/360\,=$  the number of revolutions (and partial  revolutions) of the leadscrew. By combining Equations (37.5), (37.7a), and (37.8)  and rearranging, the number of pulses required to achieve a speciﬁ  ed  $x$ -position  increment in a point-to-point system can be found:  

$$
n_{p}=\frac{360r_{g}x}{p\alpha}{=}\frac{r_{g}n_{s}A_{l s}}{360}
$$  

The velocity of the worktable in the direction of the leadscrew axis can be deter- mined as follows:  

$$
\nu_{t}=f_{r}=N_{l s}\,p
$$  

where  $\nu_{t}=$  table travel speed, $\mathrm{mm/min}\ (\mathrm{in/min});f_{r}=$ table feed rate,  $\mathrm{mm/min}$   $\mathrm{(in/}$ min);  $N_{l s}\,=$  rotational speed of the leadscrew, rev/min; and  $p\ =$ leadscrew pitch,  mm/rev (in/rev). The rotational speed of the leadscrew depends on the frequency of  pulses driving the stepping motor:  

$$
N_{l s}=\frac{60f_{p}}{n_{s}r_{g}}
$$  

where  $N_{l s}=$  leadscrew rotational speed, rev/min;  $f_{p}\,=$  pulse train frequency,  $\mathrm{Hz}$ (pulses/sec); $n_{s}=$  steps/rev, or pulses/rev, and $r_{g}=$  gear reduction between the mo- tor and the leadscrew. For a two-axis table with continuous path control, the rela- tive velocities of the axes are coordinated to achieve the desired travel direction.  Finally, the required pulse frequency to drive the table at a speciﬁ  ed feed rate can  be obtained by combining Equations (37.10) and (37.11) and rearranging to solve  for $f_{p}$ :  

$$
f_{p}=\frac{\nu_{t}n_{s}r_{g}}{60p}\!=\frac{f_{r}n_{s}r_{g}}{60p}=\frac{N_{l s}n_{s}r_{g}}{60}=\frac{N_{m}n_{s}}{60}
$$

Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the

previous curve, a downturn ﬁ  nally occurs as a result of necking. A dashed line is used  in the ﬁ  gure to indicate the projected continuation of the true stress–strain plot if  necking had not occurred.  

As strain becomes signiﬁ  cant in the plastic region, the values of true strain and  engineering strain diverge. True strain can be related to the corresponding engineer- ing strain by  

$$
\epsilon=\ln(1+e)
$$  

Similarly, true stress and engineering stress can be related by the expression  

$$
\sigma=s\,(1\,+\,e)
$$  

In Figure 3.4, note that stress increases continuously in the plastic region until  necking begins. When this happened in the engineering stress–strain curve, its sig- niﬁ  cance was lost because an admittedly erroneous area value was used to calculate  stress. Now when the true stress also increases, it cannot be dismissed so lightly.  What it means is that the metal is becoming stronger as strain increases. This is the  property called  strain hardening  that was mentioned in the previous chapter in the  discussion of metallic crystal structures, and it is a property that most metals exhibit  to a greater or lesser degree.  

# Example 3.2  True stress and  strain  

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine (a) true stress and (b) true strain  at the maximum load of  $65{,}000\:\mathrm{N}.$ .  

Solution:  (a) True stress is deﬁ  ned as the load divided by the instantaneous  area. To ﬁ  nd the instantaneous area, we assume uniform elongation prior to  necking. Thus, $A L=A_{o}L_{o}$ , and $A=A_{o}L_{o}/L=200(50)/57.7=173.3\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}/$  

$$
{\sigma=F/A=65,\!000/173.3=375\;\mathrm{MPa}}
$$  

(b) By Equation (3.7), true strain $\epsilon=\ln(L/L_{o})=\ln(57.7/50)=$ $\ln(1.154)={\bf0.143}$ .  

Check:  Use Equations (3.8) and (3.9) to check these values:  

Using Equation (3.8) and the value of  $e$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\epsilon=\ln(1+0.154)=0.143$ .  

Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.  

! $(\sigma\,=\,K\epsilon^{n})$ ) determines the behavior in the plastic region. Three basic forms of  stress–strain relationship describe the behavior of nearly all types of solid materi- als, shown in Figure 3.6:  

(a)  Perfectly elastic . The behavior of this material is deﬁ  ned completely by its stiff- ness, indicated by the modulus of elasticity  $\mathcal{L}$ . It fractures rather than yielding  to plastic ﬂ  ow. Brittle materials such as ceramics, many cast irons, and thermo- setting polymers possess stress–strain curves that fall into this category. These  materials are not good candidates for forming operations.  

(b)  Elastic and perfectly plastic . This material has a stiffness deﬁ  ned by  $E$ . Once  the yield strength  $Y$  is reached, the material deforms plastically at the same  stress level. The ﬂ  ow curve is given by  $K=Y$ and  $n=0$ . Metals behave in this  fashion when they have been heated to sufﬁ  ciently high temperatures that they  recrystallize rather than strain harden during deformation. Lead exhibits this  behavior at room temperature because room temperature is above the recrys- tallization point for lead.  

(c)  Elastic and strain hardening . This material obeys Hooke’s law in the elastic  region. It begins to ﬂ  ow at its yield strength  Y . Continued deformation requires  an ever-increasing stress, given by a ﬂ  ow curve whose strength coefﬁ  cient  $K$  is  greater than $Y$  and whose strain-hardening exponent $n$  is greater than zero. The  ﬂ  ow curve is generally represented as a linear function on a natural logarithmic  plot. Most ductile metals behave this way when cold worked.  

Manufacturing processes that deform materials through the application of   tensile  stresses include wire and bar drawing (Section 18.6) and stretch forming (Section 19.6.1).  

# 3.1.2 COMPRESSION PROPERTIES  

A compression test applies a load that squeezes a cylindrical specimen between two  platens, as illustrated in Figure 3.7. As the specimen is compressed, its height is re- duced and its cross-sectional area is increased. Engineering stress is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
s=\frac{F}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A_{o}=$  original area of the specimen. This is the same deﬁ  nition of engineering  stress used in the tensile test. The engineering strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
e=\frac{h-h_{o}}{h_{o}}

where $h=$  height of the specimen at a particular moment into the test, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and  $h_{o}=$  starting height,  $\mathrm{mm}$  (in). Because the height is decreased during compression,  the value of $e$  will be negative. The negative sign is usually ignored when expressing  values of compression strain.  

When engineering stress is plotted against engineering strain in a compression  test, the results appear as in Figure 3.8. The curve is divided into elastic and plas- tic regions, as before, but the shape of the plastic portion of the curve is different  from its tensile test complement. Because compression causes the cross section to  increase (rather than decrease as in the tensile test), the load increases more rapidly  than previously. This results in a higher value of calculated engineering stress.  

Something else happens in the compression test that contributes to the increase  in stress. As the cylindrical specimen is squeezed, friction at the surfaces in contact  with the platens tends to prevent the ends of the cylinder from spreading.   Additional

- \( d \) is the depth of cut in inches.

Given:
- \( v = 300 \) ft/min,
- \( f = 0.010 \) in/rev,
- \( d = 0.100 \) inch.

First, we need to convert the cutting speed to inches per minute (since 1 ft = 12 inches):

\[ v = 300 \text{ ft/min} \times 12 \text{ in/ft} = 3600 \text{ in/min} \]

Now, we can calculate the RMR:

\[ \text{RMR} = 3600 \text{ in/min} \times 0.010 \text{ in/rev} \times 0.100 \text{ in} \]

\[ \text{RMR} = 3.6 \text{ in}^3/\text{min} \]

"Let's analyze the provided context and the question step by step:

1. **Understanding the Material Properties and Design Guidelines for New Ceramics:**
   - **Strength in Compression vs. Tension:** New ceramics are stronger in compression than in tension.
   - **Brittleness:** Ceramics are brittle and lack ductility, making them unsuitable for impact loading or high-stress applications.
   - **Shape Complexity:** While complex geometries can be formed, simpler shapes are preferred for economic and technical reasons. Deep holes, channels, and undercuts should be avoided.
   - **Edges and Corners:** Outside edges and corners should have radii or chamfers, and inside corners should also have radii.
   - **Shrinkage Considerations:** Part shrinkage during drying, firing, and sintering must be accounted for.
   - **Threads:** Screw threads in ceramic parts should be avoided due to fabrication difficulties and inadequate strength.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks which geometric features should be avoided in the design of structural components made of new ceramics.
   - The options are: (a) complicated shapes, (b) rounded inside corners, (c) sharp edges, (d) thin sections, or (e) threads.

3. **Matching the Options with the Guidelines:**
   - **(a) Complicated shapes:** The guidelines suggest avoiding complicated shapes to keep manufacturing simple and cost-effective.
   - **(b) Rounded inside corners:** The guidelines recommend having radii on inside corners, so this is not something to avoid.
   - **(c) Sharp edges:** Sharp edges should be avoided as they can lead to stress concentrations and potential failure.
   - **(d) Thin sections:** Thin sections are not specifically mentioned as problematic in the provided context.
   - **(e) Threads:** Threads should be avoided due to fabrication difficulties and inadequate strength.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the guidelines, the geometric features to avoid are complicated shapes, sharp edges, and threads.

37.9 Photofabrication means the same process as photolithography. 
(a) True or (b) false.
Answer: (b). Photofabrication is an industrial process in which ultraviolet exposure through a pattern mask causes a significant increase in the chemical solubility of an optically clear material, thus permitting a suitable etchant to remove the exposed regions much more rapidly. This is not the same as photolithography, in which resists are used to determine the regions to be etched.

   - **Edges and Corners:** Outside edges and corners should have radii or chamfers, and inside corners should also have radii.
   - **Shrinkage Considerations:** Part shrinkage during drying, firing, and sintering must be accounted for.
   - **Threads:** Screw threads in ceramic parts should be avoided due to fabrication difficulties and inadequate strength.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The question asks which geometric features should be avoided in the design of structural components made of new ceramics.
   - The options are: (a) complicated shapes, (b) rounded inside corners, (c) sharp edges, (d) thin sections, or (e) threads.

"When cutting a ductile work material, an increase in cutting speed will generally have which effect on surface finish? (a) degrade surface finish, which means high value of Ra or (b) improve surface finish, which means lower value of Ra.",Answer. (b),"""Explanation"": ""When cutting a ductile work material, an increase in cutting speed generally improves the surface finish. This is because higher cutting speeds reduce the formation of built-up edge (BUE) and other factors that contribute to a rough surface. As a result, the actual surface roughness (Ra) tends to be lower, indicating a smoother surface finish."", ""YourChoice"": ""B"""

"Which of the following time components in the average production machining cycle is affected by cutting speed (more than one)? (a) part loading and unloading time, and (b) setup time for the machine tool, (c) time the tool is engaged in cutting, and (d) tool change time.",Answer. (c) and (d),"""Explanation"": ""In the context of machining operations, the cutting speed primarily affects the time the tool is engaged in cutting (machining time) and the tool change time. As cutting speed increases, the machining time per piece decreases because the material is removed faster. However, higher cutting speeds also lead to faster tool wear, which means the tool needs to be changed more frequently, thus increasing the tool change time per piece. Part loading and unloading time and setup time for the machine tool are generally not affected by cutting speed as they are more related to the handling and preparation processes rather than the actual cutting process."", ""YourChoice"": ""C, D"""
"Which cutting speed is always lower for a given machining operation? (a) cutting speed for maximum production rate, or (b) cutting speed for minimum cost.",Answer. (b),"""Explanation"": ""In machining operations, the cutting speed for minimum cost (vmin) is always lower than the cutting speed for maximum production rate (vmax). This is because operating at a lower speed increases the tool life, which reduces the frequency of tool changes and the associated costs. On the other hand, maximizing production rate requires higher cutting speeds to minimize machining time per piece, even though this may result in shorter tool life and higher tool change costs."", ""YourChoice"": ""B"""
A high tooling cost and/or tool change time will tend to have which of the following effects on vmax or vmin? (a) decrease or (b) increase.,Answer. (a),"""Explanation"": ""High tooling cost and/or tool change time will tend to increase the importance of maximizing tool life to reduce the frequency of tool changes. This means that the optimal cutting speed (vmax) will be decreased to prolong tool life, as higher speeds generally lead to faster tool wear. Conversely, the minimum cutting speed (vmin) may also be adjusted to ensure that the tool life is maximized within acceptable production rates."", ""YourChoice"": ""A"""
"Of the following cutting conditions, which one has the greatest effect on tool wear? (a) cutting speed, (b) depth of cut, or (c) feed.",Answer.

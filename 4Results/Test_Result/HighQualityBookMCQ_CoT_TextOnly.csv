(b),"To determine which manufacturing process will likely result in the best surface finish, let's analyze each option based on the provided context and general knowledge of manufacturing processes:

1. **Arc Welding**: This process involves joining metals by melting them with an electric arc. While it can produce strong joints, the surface finish is typically rough and may require additional finishing processes like grinding or polishing.

2. **Grinding**: Grinding is an abrasive machining process that uses a grinding wheel to remove material and achieve a fine surface finish. According to the provided text, grinding can produce extremely fine surface finishes, sometimes as fine as \(0.025\;\mu\mathrm{m}\) (1 \(\mu\)-in).

3. **Machining**: Machining processes like turning, milling, and drilling can produce good surface finishes, but they generally do not achieve the same level of smoothness as grinding.

4. **Sand Casting**: This process involves pouring molten metal into a sand mold. The surface finish of sand cast parts is typically rough due to the texture of the sand mold.

5. **Sawing**: Sawing is a cutting process that uses a blade to cut materials. The surface finish from sawing is generally rough and would require further finishing processes to achieve a smooth surface.

Based on this analysis, grinding is the process that will likely result in the best surface finish.

1. **Iron-Carbon Phase Diagram**:
   - Pure iron melts at \(1539^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\).
   - At room temperature, the phase is alpha (α), also called ferrite.
   - Ferrite (α) transforms to austenite (γ) at \(912^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\).
   - Austenite (γ) transforms to delta (δ) at \(1394^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\).

2. **Carbon Content**:
   - The question specifies a composition with 99% Fe, which implies 1% carbon.
   - According to the phase diagram, at room temperature, iron with low carbon content (up to 0.022% at \(723^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\)) is in the ferrite (α) phase.

3. **Phases at Room Temperature**:
   - Ferrite (α) is the predominant phase at room temperature for low carbon content.
   - Cementite (Fe₃C) is an intermediate phase that forms at higher carbon contents.
   - Austenite (γ) and delta (δ) phases occur at higher temperatures.
   - Gamma (γ) is another name for austenite, which is not stable at room temperature.

Given this information, the predominant phase in the iron-carbon alloy system for a composition with 99% Fe at room temperature is ferrite (α).

"An increase in cobalt content has which of the following effects on WC-Co cemented carbides (one best answer)? (a) decreases transverse rupture strength, (b) increases hardness, (c) increases toughness.",Answer. (c),"""Explanation"": ""An increase in cobalt content in WC-Co cemented carbides improves transverse rupture strength (TRS) and toughness but decreases hardness. This is because cobalt acts as a binder that enhances the toughness and TRS of the composite material, while the hardness is primarily provided by the tungsten carbide (WC) particles. Therefore, increasing the cobalt content results in higher toughness and TRS but lower hardness."", ""YourChoice"": ""C""","An increase in cobalt content in WC-Co cemented carbides improves transverse rupture strength (TRS) and toughness but decreases hardness.

"How many atoms are there in the unit cell of the face- centered cubic (FCC) unit cell (one answer)? (a) 8, (b) 9, (c) 10, (d) 12, or (e) 14.",Answer. (e),"The correct answer is:

(d) 12","The correct answer is based on the structure of the face-centered cubic (FCC) unit cell. An FCC unit cell has atoms at each of the corners of the cube and one atom at the center of each face of the cube. Each corner atom is shared among eight neighboring unit cells, and each face-centered atom is shared between two unit cells. Accounting for these shared atoms, the total number of atoms per FCC unit cell is calculated as follows:

- 8 corner atoms × 1/8 (since each is shared among 8 unit cells) = 1 atom
- 6 face-centered atoms × 1/2 (since each is shared between 2 unit cells) = 3 atoms

Thus, the total number of atoms in an FCC unit cell is 1 + 3 = 4.

However, none of the given choices (a) 8, (b) 9, (c) 10, (d) 12, or (e) 14 correctly reflects this. 

If the question is asking how many atoms are there in the unit cell itself, considering the contributions from shared atoms, the correct response based on common understanding is 4 atoms.

Given the provided choices, if we must select the closest correct answer based on the context of how the atoms are positioned (without considering the shared nature), the face-centered cubic unit cell has atoms positioned at 8 corners and 6 faces. It might be a comprehension or typographical error in the provided choices. 

For the most accurate representation from the standard understanding of FCC:

- The actual number of atoms in an FCC unit cell is 4.

Since this does not match any provided option, it might be best to clarify with the exam provider. Given the constraints, the answer should be:

**None of the provided options correctly represent the number of atoms in an FCC unit cell. The correct answer is typically 4 atoms.**"

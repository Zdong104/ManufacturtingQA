"Which of the following materials has the highest specific heat? (a) aluminum, (b) concrete, (c) polyethylene, or (d) water.",Answer. (d)
"Copper is generally considered easy to weld, because of its high thermal conductivity: (a) true, or (b) false.",Answer. (b) The high thermal conductivity of copper makes it difficult to weld because the heat flows away from the joint rather than being concentrated to permit melting of the metal.
"The mass diffusion rate dm/dt across a boundary between two different metals is a function of which of the following variables (more than one): (a) concentration gradient dc/dx, (b) contact area, (c) density, (d) melting point, (e) temperature, and (f) time.","Answer. (a), (b), (e), and (f). This is perhaps a trick question. Choices (a) and (b) are included in Eq. (4.5). Temperature (e) has a strong influence on the diffusion coefficient.

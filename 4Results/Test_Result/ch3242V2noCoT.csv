"If the product tolerance is set so that the process capability index = 1.0, then the percentage of parts that are within tolerance will be closest to which one of the following when the process is operating in statistical control? (a) 35%, (b) 65%, (c) 95%, (d) 99%, or (e) 100%.",Answer. (e),"Based on the provided context and the information from the text, the process capability index (PCI) of 1.0 corresponds to a situation where the tolerance range is equal to the natural tolerance limits (6Ïƒ). According to the text, when the design tolerances are set equal to the natural tolerance limits, 99.73% of the parts will be within tolerance.

However, the question asks for the percentage of parts that are within tolerance when the process capability index is 1.0. Referring to Table 42.1 in the text, a PCI of 1.0 corresponds to 3 standard deviations, which results in 0.27% of parts being defective. Therefore, the percentage of parts within tolerance is 100% - 0.27% = 99.73%.

Given the options provided:
(a) 35%
(b) 65%
(c) 95%
(d) 99%
(e) 100%

The closest answer to 99.73% is (d) 99%.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(d) 99%","Based on the provided context, the process capability index (PCI) is given by the equation \( \text{PCI} = \frac{T}{6\sigma} \), where \( T \) is the tolerance range and \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation. When the process capability index (PCI) is equal to 1.0, it means that the tolerance range is equal to 6 standard deviations.

From the document, it is stated that when design tolerances are set equal to the natural tolerance limits (which is 6 standard deviations, or \( 6\sigma \)), 99.73% of the parts will be within tolerance, and 0.27% will be outside the limits. This corresponds to a PCI of 1.0.

Thus, the percentage of parts that are within tolerance will be closest to 99%.

So, the correct answer is:

(d) 99%"

(a), (c), and (d).","Based on the provided context and the principles of control charts, the correct answers are:

(a) consistently increasing value of x
(c) R outside the control limits of the R chart

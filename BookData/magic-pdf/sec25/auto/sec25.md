25.5 Application Considerations  

Conventional machining processes (i.e., turning, drill- ing, milling) use a sharp cutting tool to form a chip from  the work by shear deformation. In addition to these  conventional methods, there is a group of processes that  uses other mechanisms to remove material. The term  nontraditional machining  refers to this group that  removes excess material by various techniques involv- ing mechanical, thermal, electrical, or chemical energy  (or combinations of these energies). They do not use a  sharp cutting tool in the conventional sense.  

The nontraditional processes have been developed  since World War II largely in response to new and unu- sual machining requirements that could not be satisﬁ  ed  by conventional methods. These requirements, and the  resulting commercial and technological importance of  the nontraditional processes, include:  

➢   The need to machine newly developed metals and  nonmetals. These new materials often have special  properties (e.g., high strength, high hardness, high  toughness) that make them difﬁ  cult or impossible  to machine by conventional methods.

 $\succcurlyeq$ The need for unusual and/or complex part geometries  that cannot easily be accomplished and in some cases  are impossible to achieve by conventional machining.

 ➢   The need to avoid surface damage that often  accompanies the stresses created by conventional  machining. Many of these requirements are associated with the  aerospace and electronics industries, which have become  increasingly important in recent decades.  

There are literally dozens of nontraditional machining processes, most of which are  unique in their range of applications. In the present chapter, the most important are  discussed. More detailed discussions of these nontraditional methods are presented  in several of the references.  

The nontraditional processes are often classiﬁ  ed according to principal form  of energy used to effect material removal. By this classiﬁ  cation, there are four  types:  

1.  Mechanical . Mechanical energy in some form other than the action of a conven- tional cutting tool is used in these nontraditional processes. Erosion of the work  material by a high velocity stream of abrasives or ﬂ  uid (or both) is a typical form  of mechanical action in these processes.

 2.  Electrical . These nontraditional processes use electrochemical energy to remove  material; the mechanism is the reverse of electroplating.

 3.  Thermal . These processes use thermal energy to cut or shape the work part. The  thermal energy is generally applied to a very small portion of the work surface,  causing that portion to be removed by fusion and/or vaporization. The thermal  energy is generated by the conversion of electrical energy.

 4.  Chemical . Most materials (metals particularly) are susceptible to chemical attack  by certain acids or other etchants. In chemical machining, chemicals selectively  remove material from portions of the work part, while other portions of the sur- face are protected by a mask.  

#  Mechanical Energy Processes  

This section examines several of the nontraditional processes that use mechanical  energy other than a sharp cutting tool: (1) ultrasonic machining, (2) water jet processes,  and (3) other abrasive processes.  

# 25.1.1  ULTRASONIC MACHINING  

Ultrasonic machining (USM) is a nontraditional machining process in which abrasives  contained in a slurry are driven at high velocity against the work by a tool vibrating  at low amplitude and high frequency. The amplitudes are around $0.075\:\mathrm{mm}$  (0.003 in),  and the frequencies are approximately  $20{,}000~\mathrm{Hz}$ . The tool oscillates in a direction  perpendicular to the work surface, and is fed slowly into the work, so that the shape  of the tool is formed in the part. However, it is the action of the abrasives, impinging  against the work surface, that performs the cutting. The general arrangement of the  USM process is depicted in Figure 25.1.  

Common tool materials used in USM include soft steel and stainless steel. Abrasive  materials in USM include boron nitride, boron carbide, aluminum oxide, silicon carbide,  and diamond. Grit size (Section 16.1.1) ranges between 100 and 2000. The vibration  amplitude should be set approximately equal to the grit size, and the gap size should be  maintained at about two times grit size. To a signiﬁ  cant degree, grit size determines the  surface ﬁ  nish on the new work surface. In addition to surface ﬁ  nish, material removal  rate is an important performance variable in ultrasonic machining. For a given work  material, the removal rate in USM increases with increasing frequency and amplitude  of vibration.

FIGURE 25.1  Ultrasonic machining.  

The cutting action in USM operates on the tool as well as the work. As the abrasive  particles erode the work surface, they also erode the tool, thus affecting its shape. It is  therefore important to know the relative volumes of work material and tool material  removed during the process—similar to the grinding ratio (Section 25.1.2). This ratio  of stock removed to tool wear varies for different work materials, ranging from around  100:1 for cutting glass down to about 1:1 for cutting tool steel.  

The slurry in USM consists of a mixture of water and abrasive particles. Concentra- tion of abrasives in water ranges from $20\%$  to $60\%$  [5]. The slurry must be continuously  circulated to bring fresh grains into action at the tool–work gap. It also washes away  chips and worn grits created by the cutting process.  

The development of ultrasonic machining was motivated by the need to machine  hard, brittle work materials, such as ceramics, glass, and carbides. It is also success- fully used on certain metals such as stainless steel and titanium. Shapes obtained by  USM include nonround holes, holes along a curved axis, and coining operations, in  which an image pattern on the tool is imparted to a ﬂ  at work surface.  

# 25.1.2  PROCESSES USING WATER JETS  

The two processes described in this section remove material by means of high-velocity  streams of water or a combination of water and abrasives.  

Water Jet Cutting   Water jet cutting (WJC) uses a ﬁ  ne, high-pressure, high- velocity stream of water directed at the work surface to cause cutting of the work,  as illustrated in Figure 25.2. To obtain the ﬁ  ne stream of water a small nozzle  opening of diameter 0.1 to $0.4\:\mathrm{mm}$  (0.004–0.016 in) is used. To provide the stream  with sufﬁ  cient energy for cutting, pressures up to  $400\ \mathrm{MPa}$   $(60,000\ 1\mathbf{b}/\mathbf{in}^{2})$  are  used, and the jet reaches velocities up to $900\;\mathrm{m/s}$  (3000 ft/sec). The ﬂ  uid is pressu- rized to the desired level by a hydraulic pump. The nozzle unit consists of a holder  made of stainless steel, and a jewel nozzle made of sapphire, ruby, or diamond.  Diamond lasts the longest but costs the most. Filtration systems must be used in  WJC to separate the swarf produced during cutting.  

Cutting ﬂ  uids in WJC are polymer solutions, preferred because of their tendency  to produce a coherent stream. Cutting ﬂ  uids have been discussed before in the con- text of conventional machining (Section 22.4), but never has the term been more  appropriately applied than in WJC.  

![](images/c1e56315805756686d8d0f2d5805883b07e608cef3a9d8a9d5aa978b914275c1.jpg)  
FIGURE 25.2  Water jet cutting.  

Important process parameters include standoff distance, nozzle opening diameter,  water pressure, and cutting feed rate. As in Figure 25.2, the  standoff distance  is the sepa- ration between the nozzle opening and the work surface. It is generally desirable for  this distance to be small to minimize dispersion of the ﬂ  uid stream before it strikes the  surface. A typical standoff distance is $3.2\,\mathrm{mm}$  (0.125 in). Size of the nozzle oriﬁ  ce affects  the precision of the cut; smaller openings are used for ﬁ  ner cuts on thinner materials. To  cut thicker stock, thicker jet streams and higher pressures are required. The cutting feed  rate refers to the velocity at which the WJC nozzle is traversed along the cutting path.  Typical feed rates range from $5\,\mathrm{mm/s}$   $(12\,\mathrm{in/min})$  to more than  $500\,\mathrm{mm/s}$   $(1200\,\mathrm{in/min})$ ,  depending on work material and its thickness [5]. The WJC process is usually automated  using computer numerical control or industrial robots to manipulate the nozzle unit  along the desired trajectory.  

Water jet cutting can be used effectively to cut narrow slits in ﬂ  at stock such as  plastic, textiles, composites, ﬂ  oor tile, carpet, leather, and cardboard. Robotic cells  have been installed with WJC nozzles mounted as the robot’s tool to follow cut- ting patterns that are irregular in three dimensions, such as cutting and trimming  of automobile dashboards before assembly [9]. In these applications, advantages  of WJC include (1) no crushing or burning of the work surface typical in other  mechanical or thermal processes, (2) minimum material loss because of the narrow  cut slit, (3) no environmental pollution, and (4) ease of automating the process.  A limitation of WJC is that the process is not suitable for cutting brittle materials  (e.g., glass) because of their tendency to crack during cutting.  

Abrasive Water Jet Cutting   When WJC is used on metallic work parts, abrasive  particles must usually be added to the jet stream to facilitate cutting. This process is  therefore called  abrasive water jet cutting  (AWJC). Introduction of abrasive particles  into the stream complicates the process by adding to the number of parameters that  must be controlled. Among the additional parameters are abrasive type, grit size, and  ﬂ  ow rate. Aluminum oxide, silicon dioxide, and garnet (a silicate mineral) are typical  abrasive materials, at grit sizes ranging between 60 and 120. The abrasive particles are  added to the water stream at approximately $0.25\,\mathrm{kg/min}\,(0.5\,\mathrm{lb/min})$  after it has exited  the WJC nozzle.  

The remaining process parameters include those that are common to WJC: nozzle  opening diameter, water pressure, and standoff distance. Nozzle oriﬁ  ce diameters  are 0.25 to $0.63\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.010–0.025 in)—somewhat larger than in water jet cutting to  permit higher ﬂ  ow rates and more energy to be contained in the stream before injec- tion of abrasives. Water pressures are about the same as in WJC. Standoff distances  are somewhat less to minimize the effect of dispersion of the cutting ﬂ  uid that now  contains abrasive particles. Typical standoff distances are between 1/4 and 1/2 of  those in WJC.  

# 25.1.3  OTHER NONTRADITIONAL ABRASIVE PROCESSES  

Two additional mechanical energy processes use abrasives to accomplish deburring,  polishing, or other operations in which very little material is removed.  

Abrasive Jet Machining   Not to be confused with AWJC is the process called  abrasive jet machining (AJM), a material removal process caused by the action of  a high-velocity stream of gas containing small abrasive particles, as in Figure 25.3.  The gas is dry, and pressures of 0.2 to $1.4\;\mathrm{MPa}$   $(25{-}200\;1\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ) are used to propel it  through nozzle oriﬁ  ces of diameter 0.075 to  $1.0\ \mathrm{mm}\ (0.003–0.040\ \mathrm{in})$  at velocities  of 2.5 to $5.0\:\mathrm{m/s}$   $(500{-}1000\;\mathrm{ft/min})$ ). Gases include dry air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide,  and helium.  

The process is usually performed manually by an operator who directs the nozzle  at the work. Typical distances between nozzle tip and work surface range from 3 to  $75~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.125–3 in). The workstation must be set up to provide proper ventilation  for the operator.  

AJM is normally used as a ﬁ  nishing process rather than a production cutting  process. Applications include deburring, trimming and deﬂ  ashing, cleaning, and  polishing. Cutting is accomplished successfully on hard, brittle materials (e.g., glass,  silicon, mica, and ceramics) that are in the form of thin ﬂ  at stock. Typical abrasives  used in AJM include aluminum oxide (for aluminum and brass), silicon carbide  (for stainless steel and ceramics), and glass beads (for polishing). Grit sizes are  small, 15 to $40\;\mu\mathrm{m}$  (0.0006–0.0016 in) in diameter, and must be uniform in size for  a given application. It is important not to recycle the abrasives because used grains  become fractured (and therefore smaller in size), worn, and contaminated.  

Abrasive Flow Machining   This process was developed in the 1960s to deburr and  polish difﬁ  cult-to-reach areas using abrasive particles mixed in a viscoelastic polymer  FIGURE 25.3  Abrasive  jet machining (AJM).  

![](images/61f7114ab050b7f40f102529a70cc332ec93e6372efe4de5f1bb8a444b9bfc90.jpg)  

that is forced to ﬂ  ow through or around the part surfaces and edges. The polymer has  the consistency of putty. Silicon carbide is a typical abrasive. Abrasive ﬂ  ow machining  (AFM) is particularly well-suited for internal passageways that are often inaccessible by  conventional methods. The abrasive-polymer mixture, called the media, ﬂ  ows past the  target regions of the part under pressures ranging from 0.7 to $20\,\mathrm{MPa}$   $(100{-}3000\,\mathrm{lb/in^{2}})$ .  In addition to deburring and polishing, other AFM applications include forming radii on  sharp edges, removing rough surfaces on castings, and other ﬁ  nishing operations. These  applications are found in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and die-making. The  process can be automated to economically ﬁ  nish hundreds of parts per hour.  

A common setup is to position the work part between two opposing cylinders, one  containing media and the other empty. The media is forced to ﬂ  ow through the part  from the ﬁ  rst cylinder to the other, and then back again, as many times as necessary  to achieve the desired material removal and ﬁ  nish.  

#  Electrochemical Machining Processes  

An important group of nontraditional processes use electrical energy to remove ma- terial. This group is identiﬁ  ed by the term  electrochemical processes , because elec- trical energy is used in combination with chemical reactions to accomplish material  removal. In effect, these processes are the reverse of electroplating (Section 27.3.1).  The work material must be a conductor in the electrochemical machining processes.  

# 25.2.1  ELECTROCHEMICAL MACHINING  

The basic process in this group is electrochemical machining (ECM). Electrochemical  machining removes metal from an electrically conductive workpiece by anodic dis- solution, in which the shape of the workpiece is obtained by a formed electrode tool in  close proximity to, but separated from, the work by a rapidly ﬂ  owing electrolyte. ECM  is basically a deplating operation. As illustrated in Figure 25.4, the workpiece is the  anode, and the tool is the cathode. The principle underlying the process is that material  FIGURE 25.4  Electrochemical  machining (ECM).  

![](images/75cfb954be1d19903aa8ab973f4d072b3e4b6d4ec60b9989280e2d0cc72dc749.jpg)  

is deplated from the anode (the positive pole) and deposited onto the cathode (the  negative pole) in the presence of an electrolyte bath (Section 4.5). The difference in  ECM is that the electrolyte bath ﬂ  ows rapidly between the two poles to carry off the  deplated material, so that it does not become plated onto the tool.  

The electrode tool, usually made of copper, brass, or stainless steel, is designed to  possess approximately the inverse of the desired ﬁ  nal shape of the part. An allowance in  the tool size must be provided for the gap that exists between the tool and the work. To  accomplish metal removal, the electrode is fed into the work at a rate equal to the rate  of metal removal from the work. Metal removal rate is determined by Faraday’s First  Law, which states that the amount of chemical change produced by an electric current 

 (i.e., the amount of metal dissolved) is proportional to the quantity of electricity passed 

 (current $\times$  time):  

$$
V=C I t
$$  

where  $V=$  volume of metal removed,  $\mathrm{mm}^{3}$  ( $(\mathrm{in}^{3})$ );  $C=\mathrm{a}$  constant called the speciﬁ  c  removal rate that depends on atomic weight, valence, and density of the work material,  mm 3 /amp- s  $\mathrm{(in^{3}/a m p\mathrm{-min})}$ ;  $I=$  current, amps; and $t=$  time, s (min).  

Based on Ohm’s law, current  $I=E/R$ , where  $E=$  voltage and  $R\,=$  resistance.  Under the conditions of the ECM operation, resistance is given by  

$$
R={\frac{g r}{A}}
$$  

where  $g={\mathrm{gap}}$  between electrode and work, mm (in);  $r=$  resistivity of electrolyte,  ohm-mm (ohm-in); and  $A\,=$  surface area between work and tool in the working  frontal gap, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ . Substituting this expression for $R$  into Ohm’s law,  

$$
I={\frac{E A}{g r}}\,
$$  

And substituting this equation back into the equation deﬁ  ning Faraday’s law,  

$$
V={\frac{C(E A t)}{g r}}\,
$$  

It is convenient to convert this equation into an expression for feed rate, the rate  at which the electrode (tool) can be advanced into the work. This conversion can  be accomplished in two steps. First, divide both sides of Equation (25.4) by  $A t$ ( ${\mathrm{area}}\times{\mathrm{time}}.$ ) to convert volume of metal removed into a linear travel rate:  

$$
{\frac{V}{A t}}=f_{r}={\frac{C E}{g r}}
$$  

where $f_{r}=$  feed rate,  $\mathrm{mm/s\(in/min)}$ . Second, substitute  $I/A$  in place of  $E/(g r)$ , as  provided by Equation (25.3). Thus, feed rate in ECM is  

$$
f_{r}={\frac{C I}{A}}
$$  

where $A=$  the frontal area of the electrode, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ . This is the projected area of the  tool in the direction of the feed into the work. Values of speciﬁ  c removal rate  $C$  are  presented in Table 25.1 for various work materials. Note that this equation assumes  $100\%$  efﬁ  ciency of metal removal. The actual efﬁ  ciency is in the range  $90\%$  to  $100\%$ and depends on tool shape, voltage and current density, and other factors.

Compiled from data in [8]. a  Most common valence given in parentheses () is assumed in determining speciﬁ  c removal rate  C . For different valence, multiply  $C$  by  most common valence and divide by actual valence.  

# Example 25.1  Electrochemical  machining  

An ECM operation is to be used to cut a hole into a plate of aluminum that is  $12\:\mathrm{mm}$  thick. The hole has a rectangular cross section,  $10\:\mathrm{mm}$  by  $30\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The  ECM operation will be accomplished at a current $=1200$  amps. Efﬁ  ciency is  expected to be $95\%$ . Determine feed rate and time required to cut through  the plate.  

Solution   From Table 25.1, speciﬁ  c removal rate  $C$  for aluminum $=3.44\times10^{-2}$ $\mathrm{mm}^{3}/\mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{-S}}$  The frontal area of the electrode $A=10\:\mathrm{mm}\times30\:\mathrm{mm}=300\:\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ .  At a current level of 1200 amps, feed rate is  

$$
f_{r}=0.0344\,\mathrm{mm}^{3}/\mathrm{A}{\cdot}\mathrm{s}=0.1376\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{s}
$$  

At an efﬁ  ciency of  $95\%$ , the actual feed rate is  

$$
f_{r}=0.1376\;\mathrm{mm/s}\;(0.95)={\bf0.1307\;\mathrm{mm/s}}
$$  

Time to machine through the  $12{\mathrm{-mm}}$  plate is  

$$
T_{m}=\frac{12.0}{0.1307}=91.8\:\mathrm{s}=1.53\:\mathrm{min}
$$  

The preceding equations indicate the important process parameters for determin- ing metal removal rate and feed rate in electrochemical machining: gap distance  $g$ ,  electrolyte resistivity $r$ , current $I$ , and electrode frontal area $A$ . Gap distance needs to  be controlled closely. If $g$  becomes too large, the electrochemical process slows down.  However, if the electrode touches the work, a short circuit occurs, which stops the  process altogether. As a practical matter, gap distance is usually maintained within a  range 0.075 to  $0.75\:\mathrm{mm}$  (0.003–0.030 in).  

Water is used as the base for the electrolyte in ECM. To reduce electrolyte resis- tivity, salts such as NaCl or $\mathrm{NaNO}_{3}$  are added in solution. In addition to carrying off  the material that has been removed from the workpiece, the ﬂ  owing electrolyte also  serves the function of removing heat and hydrogen bubbles created in the chemical  reactions of the process. The removed work material is in the form of microscopic  particles that must be separated from the electrolyte through centrifuge, sedimenta- tion, or other means. The separated particles form a thick sludge whose disposal is  an environmental problem associated with ECM.  

Large amounts of electrical power are required to perform ECM. As the equa- tions indicate, rate of metal removal is determined by electrical power, speciﬁ  cally  the current density that can be supplied to the operation. The voltage in ECM is kept  relatively low to minimize arcing across the gap.  

Electrochemical machining is generally used in applications in which the work  metal is very hard or difﬁ  cult to machine, or the work part geometry is difﬁ  cult  (or impossible) to accomplish by conventional machining methods. Work hard- ness makes no difference in ECM, because the metal removal is not mechanical.  Typical ECM applications include (1)  die sinking , which involves the machining  of irregular shapes and contours into forging dies, plastic molds, and other shaping  tools; (2) multiple hole drilling, in which many holes can be drilled simultaneously  with ECM and conventional drilling would probably require the holes to be made  sequentially; (3) holes that are not round, because ECM does not use a rotating  drill; and (4) deburring.  

Advantages of ECM include (1) little surface damage to the work part, (2) no burrs  as in conventional machining, (3) low tool wear (the only tool wear results from the  ﬂ  owing electrolyte), and (4) relatively high metal removal rates for hard and difﬁ  cult- to-machine metals. Disadvantages of ECM are (1) signiﬁ  cant cost of electrical power  to drive the operation and (2) problems of disposing of the electrolyte sludge.  

# 25.2.2  ELECTROCHEMICAL DEBURRING AND GRINDING  

Electrochemical deburring (ECD) is an adaptation of ECM designed to remove burrs  or to round sharp corners on metal work parts by anodic dissolution. One possible  setup for ECD is shown in Figure 25.5. The hole in the work part has a sharp burr of the  type that is produced in a conventional through-hole drilling operation. The electrode  tool is designed to focus the metal removal action on the burr. Portions of the tool not  being used for machining are insulated. The electrolyte ﬂ  ows through the hole to carry  away the burr particles. The same ECM principles of operation also apply to ECD.  However, since much less material is removed in electrochemical deburring, cycle times  are much shorter. A typical cycle time in ECD is less than a minute. The time can be  increased if it is desired to round the corner in addition to removing the burr.  

Electrochemical grinding  (ECG) is a special form of ECM in which a rotating grind- ing wheel with a conductive bond material is used to augment the anodic dissolution

of the metal work part surface, as illustrated in Figure 25.6. Abrasives used in ECG  include aluminum oxide and diamond. The bond material is either metallic (for diamond  abrasives) or resin bond impregnated with metal particles to make it electrically con- ductive (for aluminum oxide). The abrasive grits protruding from the grinding wheel at  the contact with the work part establish the gap distance in ECG. The electrolyte ﬂ  ows  through the gap between the grains to play its role in electrolysis.  

Deplating is responsible for  $95\%$  or more of the metal removal in ECG, and the  abrasive action of the grinding wheel removes the remaining  $5\%$  or less, mostly in  the form of salt ﬁ  lms that have been formed during the electrochemical reac  tions at  the work surface. Because most of the machining is accomplished by electro  chemical  action, the grinding wheel in ECG lasts much longer than a wheel in conventional  grinding. The result is a much higher grinding ratio. In addition, dressing of the grind- ing wheel is required much less frequently. These are the signiﬁ  cant advantages of  the process. Applications of ECG include sharpening of cemented carbide tools and  grinding of surgical needles, other thin wall tubes, and fragile parts.  

#  Thermal Energy Processes  

Material removal processes based on thermal energy are characterized by very high  local temperatures—hot enough to remove material by fusion or vaporization. Because  of the high temperatures, these processes cause physical and metallurgical damage to  the new work surface. In some cases, the resulting ﬁ  nish is so poor that subsequent  processing is required to smooth the surface. This section examines several thermal  energy processes that are commercially important: (1) electric discharge machining and  electric discharge wire cutting, (2) electron beam machining, (3) laser beam machining,  (4) arc cutting processes, and (5) oxyfuel cutting processes.  

# 25.3.1  ELECTRIC DISCHARGE PROCESSES  

Electric discharge processes remove metal by a series of discrete electrical discharges  (sparks) that cause localized temperatures high enough to melt or vaporize the metal  in the immediate vicinity of the discharge. The two main processes in this category  are (1) electric discharge machining and (2) wire electric discharge machining. These  processes can be used only on electrically conducting work materials.  

![](images/144a3f038ccdffe674a318f2873a5062f78ef5574ebba5d0238636df43147bb2.jpg)  
FIGURE 25.7  Electric discharge machining (EDM): (a) overall setup, and (b) close-up view of gap, showing discharge  and metal removal.  

Electric Discharge Machining   Electric discharge machining (EDM) is one of  the most widely used nontraditional processes. An EDM setup is illustrated in  Figure 25.7. The shape of the ﬁ  nished work surface is produced by a formed elec- trode tool. The sparks occur across a small gap between tool and work surface. The  EDM process must take place in the presence of a dielectric ﬂ  uid, which creates  a path for each discharge as the ﬂ  uid becomes ionized in the gap. The discharges  are generated by a pulsating direct current power supply connected to the work  and the tool.  

Figure 25.7(b) shows a close-up view of the gap between the tool and the work.  The discharge occurs at the location where the two surfaces are closest. The dielectric  ﬂ  uid ionizes at this location to create a path for the discharge. The region in which  discharge occurs is heated to extremely high temperatures, so that a small portion of  the work surface is suddenly melted and removed. The ﬂ  owing dielectric then ﬂ  ushes  away the small particle (call it a “chip”). Because the surface of the work at the loca- tion of the previous discharge is now separated from the tool by a greater distance,  this location is less likely to be the site of another spark until the surrounding regions  have been reduced to the same level or below. Although the individual discharges  remove metal at very localized points, they occur hundreds or thousands of times per  second so that a gradual erosion of the entire surface occurs in the area of the gap.  

Two important process parameters in EDM are discharge current and frequency  of discharges. As either of these parameters is increased, metal removal rate increases.  Surface roughness is also affected by current and frequency, as shown in Figure 25.8(a).  The best surface ﬁ  nish is obtained in EDM by operating at high frequencies and low  discharge currents. As the electrode tool penetrates into the work, overcutting occurs.  Overcut  in EDM is the distance by which the machined cavity in the work part exceeds  the size of the tool on each side of the tool, as illustrated in Figure 25.7(a). It is produced  because the electrical discharges occur at the sides of the tool as well as its frontal  area. Overcut is a function of current and frequency, as seen in Figure 25.8(b), and can  amount to several hundredths of a millimeter.

The high spark temperatures that melt the work also melt the tool, creating a small  cavity in the surface opposite the cavity produced in the work. Tool wear is usually  measured as the ratio of work material removed to tool material removed (similar  to the grinding ratio). This wear ratio ranges between 1.0 and 100 or slightly above,  depending on the combination of work and electrode materials. Electrodes are made  of graphite, copper, brass, copper tungsten, silver tungsten, and other materials. The  selection depends on the type of power supply circuit available on the EDM machine,  the type of work material that is to be machined, and whether roughing or ﬁ  nish- ing is to be done. Graphite is preferred for many applications because of its melting  characteristics. In fact, graphite does not melt. It vaporizes at very high temperatures,  and the cavity created by the spark is generally smaller than for most other EDM  electrode materials. Consequently, a high ratio of work material removed to tool wear  is usually obtained with graphite tools.  

The hardness and strength of the work material are not factors in EDM, because  the process is not a contest of hardness between tool and work. The melting point of  the work material is an important property, and metal removal rate can be related to  melting point approximately by the following empirical formula, based on an equation  described in Weller [18]:  

$$
R_{M R}=\frac{K I}{T_{m}^{1.23}}
$$  

where $R_{M R}=$  metal removal rate, $\mathrm{mm}^{3}/\mathrm{s}$   $(\mathrm{in}^{3}/\mathrm{min})$ ; $K=$  constant of proportionality  whose value $=664$  in SI units (5.08 in U.S. customary units); $I=$  discharge current,  amps; and  $T_{m}\,=$  melting temperature of work metal,  $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $\mathrm{(^{\circ}F)}$ ). Melting points of  selected metals are listed in Table 4.1.  

Copper is to be machined in an EDM operation. If discharge current $=25$  amps,  what is the expected metal removal rate?  

Solution   From Table 4.1, the melting point of copper is found to be $1083^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$   Using Equation (25.7), the anticipated metal removal rate is  

$$
R_{M R}={\frac{664(25)}{1083^{1.23}}}=3.07\,\mathrm{{mm}^{3}/\mathrm{{s}}}
$$  

Dielectric ﬂ  uids used in EDM include hydrocarbon oils, kerosene, and distilled  or deionized water. The dielectric ﬂ  uid serves as an insulator in the gap except when  ionization occurs in the presence of a spark. Its other functions are to ﬂ  ush debris  out of the gap and remove heat from tool and work part.  

Applications of electric discharge machining include both tool fabrication and  parts production. The tooling for many of the mechanical processes discussed in this  book are often made by EDM, including molds for plastic injection molding, extru- sion dies, wire drawing dies, forging and heading dies, and sheet metal stamping dies.  As in ECM, the term  die sinking  is used for operations in which a mold cavity is  produced, and the EDM process is sometimes referred to as  ram EDM . For many of  the applications, the materials used to fabricate the tooling are difﬁ  cult (or impos- sible) to machine by conventional methods. Certain production parts also call for  application of EDM. Examples include delicate parts that are not rigid enough to  withstand conventional cutting forces, hole drilling where the axis of the hole is at an  acute angle to the surface so that a conventional drill would be unable to start the  hole, and production machining of hard and exotic metals.  

Electric Discharge Wire Cutting  Electric discharge wire cutting (EDWC),  commonly called  wire EDM , is a special form of electric discharge machining  that uses a small diameter wire as the electrode to cut a narrow kerf in the work.  The cutting action in wire EDM is achieved by thermal energy from electric dis- charges between the electrode wire and the workpiece. Wire EDM is illustrated in  Figure 25.9. The workpiece is fed past the wire to achieve the desired cutting path,  somewhat in the manner of a bandsaw operation. Numerical control is used to  control the work part motions during cutting. As it cuts, the wire is slowly and con- tinuously advanced between a supply spool and a take-up spool to present a fresh  electrode of constant diameter to the work. This helps to maintain a constant kerf  width during cutting. As in EDM, wire EDM must be carried out in the presence  of a dielectric. This is applied by nozzles directed at the tool–work interface as in  the ﬁ  gure, or the work part is submerged in a dielectric bath.  

Wire diameters range from 0.076 to  $0.30~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.003–0.012 in), depending on  required kerf width. Materials used for the wire include brass, copper, tungsten, and  molybdenum. Dielectric ﬂ  uids include deionized water or oil. As in EDM, an over- cut exists in wire EDM that makes the kerf larger than the wire diameter, as shown  

![](images/749f3ee63b2d739da62deeb0ed21a6c2bffeb7a4c4571c90471f64a1272876e2.jpg)

in Figure 25.10. This overcut is in the range 0.020 to  $0.050~\mathrm{mm}$ (0.0008–0.002 in).  Once cutting conditions have been established for a given cut, the overcut remains  fairly constant and predictable.  

Although EDWC seems similar to a bandsaw operation, its precision far exceeds  that of a bandsaw. The kerf is much narrower, corners can be made much sharper,  and the cutting forces against the work are nil. In addition, hardness and toughness  of the work material do not affect cutting performance. The only requirement is that  the work material must be electrically conductive.  

The special features of wire EDM make it ideal for making components for  stamping dies. Because the kerf is so narrow, it is often possible to fabricate punch  and die in a single cut, as suggested by Figure 25.11. Other tools and parts with

intricate outline shapes, such as lathe form tools, extrusion dies, and ﬂ  at templates,  are made with electric discharge wire cutting.  

# 25.3.2  ELECTRON BEAM MACHINING  

Electron beam machining (EBM) is one of several industrial processes that use  electron beams. Besides machining, other applications of the technology include  heat treating (Section 26.5.2) and welding (Section 29.4).  Electron beam machin- ing  uses a high velocity stream of electrons focused on the workpiece surface to  remove material by melting and vaporization. A schematic of the EBM process is  illustrated in Figure 25.12. An electron beam gun generates a continuous stream  of electrons that is accelerated to approximately  $75\%$  of the speed of light and  focused through an electromagnetic lens on the work surface. The lens is capable  of reducing the area of the beam to a diameter as small as  $0.025\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.001 in). On  impinging the surface, the kinetic energy of the electrons is converted into thermal  energy of extremely high density that melts or vaporizes the material in a very  localized area.  

Electron beam machining is used for a variety of high-precision cutting appli- cations on any known material. Applications include drilling of extremely small  diameter holes—down to $0.05\ \mathrm{mm}$  (0.002 in) diameter, drilling of holes with very  high depth-to-diameter ratios—more than 100:1, and cutting of slots that are only  about 0.001 in  $(0.025~\mathrm{mm})$ ) wide. These cuts can be made to very close tolerances  with no cutting forces or tool wear. The process is ideal for micromachining and is  generally limited to cutting operations in thin parts—in the range 0.25 to  $6.3\ \mathrm{mm}$ (0.010–0.250 in) thick. EBM must be carried out in a vacuum chamber to eliminate  collision of the electrons with gas molecules. Other limitations include the high  energy required and expensive equipment.

# 25.3.3  LASER BEAM MACHINING  

Lasers are being used for a variety of industrial applications, including heat treatment  (Section 26.5.2), welding (Section 29.4), rapid prototyping (Section 32.2), measure- ment (Section 40.6.2), as well as scribing, cutting, and drilling (described here). The  term  laser  stands for  l ight  a mpliﬁ  cation by  s timulated  e mission of  r adiation. A laser  is an optical transducer that converts electrical energy into a highly coherent light  beam. A laser light beam has several properties that distinguish it from other forms of  light. It is monochromatic (theoretically, the light has a single wave length) and highly  collimated (the light rays in the beam are almost perfectly parallel). These properties  allow the light generated by a laser to be focused, using conventional optical lenses,  onto a very small spot with resulting high power densities. Depending on the amount  of energy contained in the light beam, and its degree of concentration at the spot, the  various laser processes identiﬁ  ed above can be accomplished.  

Laser beam machining  (LBM) uses the light energy from a laser to remove material  by vaporization and ablation. The setup for LBM is illustrated in Figure 25.13. The types  of lasers used in LBM are carbon dioxide gas lasers and solid-state lasers (of which  there are several types). In laser beam machining, the energy of the coherent light beam  is concentrated not only optically but also in terms of time. The light beam is pulsed so  that the released energy results in an impulse against the work surface that produces  a combination of evaporation and melting, with the melted material evacuating the  surface at high velocity.  

LBM is used to perform various types of drilling, slitting, slotting, scribing, and  marking operations. Drilling small diameter holes is possible—down to  $0.025~\mathrm{mm}$   (0.001 in). For larger holes, above  $0.50{\mathrm{-mm}}$ (0.020-in) diameter, the laser beam is  controlled to cut the outline of the hole. LBM is not considered a mass production  process, and it is generally used on thin stock. The range of work materials that can  be machined by LBM is virtually unlimited. Ideal properties of a material for LBM

include high light energy absorption, poor reﬂ  ectivity, good thermal conductivity,  low speciﬁ  c heat, low heat of fusion, and low heat of vaporization. Of course, no  material has this ideal combination of properties. The actual list of work materials  processed by LBM includes metals with high hardness and strength, soft metals,  ceramics, glass and glass epoxy, plastics, rubber, cloth, and wood. Figure 25.14 shows  several parts cut by LBM.  

# 25.3.4  ARC-CUTTING PROCESSES  

The intense heat from an electric arc can be used to melt virtually any metal for the  purpose of welding or cutting. Most arc-cutting processes use the heat generated by  an arc between an electrode and a metallic work part (usually a ﬂ  at plate or sheet)  to melt a kerf that separates the part. The most common arc-cutting processes are  (1) plasma arc cutting and (2) air carbon arc cutting [11].  

Plasma Arc Cutting   A  plasma  is a superheated, electrically ionized gas. Plasma  arc cutting (PAC) uses a plasma stream operating at temperatures in the range  $10{,}000^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$  to  $14{,}000^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  ( $\mathrm{\Gamma_{18,000}\mathrm{°F}–25,\!000\mathrm{°F})}$  to cut metal by melting, as shown in  Figure 25.15. The cutting action operates by directing the high-velocity plasma  stream at the work, thus melting it and blowing the molten metal through the kerf.  The plasma arc is generated between an electrode inside the torch and the anode  workpiece. The plasma ﬂ  ows through a water-cooled nozzle that constricts and  directs the stream to the desired location on the work. The resulting plasma jet  is a high-velocity, well-collimated stream with extremely high temperatures at its  center, hot enough to cut through metal in some cases $150\;\mathrm{mm}$  (6 in) thick.  

FIGURE 25.15  Plasma  arc cutting (PAC).  

![](images/315d85f4535e3da42e73e5a7f3b737d3e5585ef64a4bb05f7e8cb2478ff505a5.jpg)  

Gases used to create the plasma in PAC include nitrogen, argon, hydrogen, or  mixtures of these gases. These are referred to as the primary gases in the process.  Secondary gases or water are often directed to surround the plasma jet to help  conﬁ  ne the arc and clean the kerf of molten metal as it forms.  

Most applications of PAC involve cutting of ﬂ  at metal sheets and plates. Opera- tions include hole piercing and cutting along a deﬁ  ned path. The desired path can  be cut either by use of a hand-held torch manipulated by a human operator, or by  directing the cutting path of the torch under numerical control (NC). For faster  production and higher accuracy, NC is preferred because of better control over the  important process variables such as standoff distance and feed rate. Plasma arc cut- ting can be used to cut nearly any electrically conductive metal. Metals frequently  cut by PAC include plain carbon steel, stainless steel, and aluminum. The advantage  of NC in these applications is high productivity. Feed rates along the cutting path  can be as high as $200\;\mathrm{mm/s}$   $(450\;\mathrm{in/min})$  for 6-mm (0.25-in) aluminum plate and 85  $\mathrm{mm/s}$   $(200\,\mathrm{in/min})$ ) for $6\mathrm{-mm}$  (0.25-in) steel plate [8]. Feed rates must be reduced for  thicker stock. For example, the maximum feed rate for cutting $100{\mathrm{-mm}}$ - (4-in)-thick  aluminum stock is around $8\,\mathrm{mm/s}$   $(20\,\mathrm{in}/\mathrm{min})$ ) [8]. Disadvantages of PAC are (1) the  cut surface is rough, and (2) metallurgical damage at the surface is the most severe  among the nontraditional metalworking processes.  

Air Carbon Arc Cutting   In this process, the arc is generated between a carbon  electrode and the metallic work, and a high-velocity air jet is used to blow away the  melted portion of the metal. This procedure can be used to form a kerf for severing  the piece, or to gouge a cavity in the part. Gouging is used to prepare the edges of  plates for welding, for example to create a U-groove in a butt joint (Section 28.2.1).  Air carbon arc cutting is used on a variety of metals, including cast iron, carbon steel,  low alloy, and stainless steels, and various nonferrous alloys. Spattering of the molten  metal is a hazard and a disadvantage of the process.  

Other Arc-Cutting Processes   Various other electric arc processes are used for  cutting applications, although not as widely as plasma arc and air carbon arc cutting.  

These other processes include (1) gas metal arc cutting, (2) shielded metal arc cut- ting, (3) gas tungsten arc cutting, and (4) carbon arc cutting. The technologies are the  same as those used in arc welding (Section 29.1), except that the heat of the electric  arc is used for cutting.  

# 25.3.5  OXYFUEL-CUTTING PROCESSES  

A widely used family of thermal cutting processes, popularly known as  ﬂ  ame cutting ,  use the heat of combustion of certain fuel gases combined with the exothermic reac- tion of the metal with oxygen. The cutting torch used in these processes is designed to  deliver a mixture of fuel gas and oxygen in the proper amounts, and to direct a stream  of oxygen to the cutting region. The primary mechanism of material removal in oxyfuel  cutting (OFC) is the chemical reaction of oxygen with the base metal. The purpose of  the oxyfuel combustion is to raise the temperature in the region of cutting to support  the reaction. These processes are commonly used to cut ferrous metal plates, in which  the rapid oxidation of iron occurs according to the following reactions [11]:  

$$
\mathrm{Fe+O\toFeO+heat}
$$  

$$
3\mathrm{Fe}+2\mathrm{O}_{2}\rightarrow\mathrm{Fe}_{3}\mathrm{O}_{4}+\mathrm{heat}
$$  

$$
2\mathrm{Fe}+1.5\mathrm{O}_{2}\rightarrow\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}+\mathrm{heat}
$$  

The second of these reactions, Equation (25.8b), is the most signiﬁ  cant in terms of  heat generation.  

The cutting mechanism for nonferrous metals is somewhat different. These metals  are generally characterized by lower melting temperatures than the ferrous metals,  and they are more oxidation resistant. In these cases, the heat of combustion of the  oxyfuel mixture plays a more important role in creating the kerf. Also, to promote  the metal oxidation reaction, chemical ﬂ  uxes or metallic powders are often added to  the oxygen stream.  

Fuels used in OFC include acetylene  $\mathrm{(C_{2}H_{2}}$ ), MAPP (methylacetylene-propadiene— $\mathrm{C}_{3}\mathrm{H}_{4}$ ), propylene $\left(\mathrm{C}_{3}\mathrm{H}_{6}\right)$ , and propane $\mathrm{(C_{3}H_{8,}}$ ). Flame temperatures and heats of com- bustion for these fuels are listed in Table 29.2. Acetylene burns at the highest ﬂ  ame  temperature and is the most widely used fuel for welding and cutting. However,  there are certain hazards with the storage and handling of acetylene that must be  considered (Section 29.3.1).  

OFC processes are performed either manually or by machine. Manually operated  torches are used for repair work, cutting of scrap metal, trimming of risers from sand  castings, and similar operations that generally require minimal accuracy. For produc- tion work, machine ﬂ  ame cutting allows faster speeds and greater accuracies. This  equipment is often numerically controlled to allow proﬁ  led shapes to be cut.  

Chemical machining (CHM) is a nontraditional process in which material is removed  by means of a strong chemical etchant. Applications as an industrial process began shortly  after World War II in the aircraft industry. The use of chemicals to remove unwanted  material from a work part can be accomplished in several ways, and different terms have  been developed to distinguish the applications. These terms include chemical milling,  chemical blanking, chemical engraving, and photo  chemical machining (PCM). They all  use the same mechanism of material removal, and it is appropriate to discuss the general  characteristics of chemical machining before deﬁ  ning the individual processes.  

# 25.4.1  MECHANICS AND CHEMISTRY OF CHEMICAL MACHINING  

The chemical machining process consists of several steps. Differences in applications  and the ways in which the steps are implemented account for the different forms of  CHM. The steps are:  

1.  Cleaning . The ﬁ  rst step is a cleaning operation to ensure that material will be  removed uniformly from the surfaces to be etched.

 2.  Masking . A protective coating called a maskant is applied to certain portions of  the part surface. This maskant is made of a material that is chemically resistant  to the etchant (the term  resist  is used for this masking material). It is therefore  applied to those portions of the work surface that are not to be etched.

 3.  Etching . This is the material removal step. The part is immersed in an etchant  that chemically attacks those portions of the part surface that are not masked.  The usual method of attack is to convert the work material (e.g., a metal) into a  salt that dissolves in the etchant and is thereby removed from the surface. When  the desired amount of material has been removed, the part is withdrawn from  the etchant and washed to stop the process.  

4.  Demasking . The maskant is removed from the part.  

The two steps in chemical machining that involve signiﬁ  cant variations in methods,  materials, and process parameters are masking and etching—steps 2 and 3.  

Maskant materials include neoprene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, and other  polymers. Masking can be accomplished by any of three methods: (1) cut and peel,  (2) photographic resist, and (3) screen resist. The  cut and peel  method applies the  maskant over the entire part by dipping, painting, or spraying. The resulting thick- ness of the maskant is 0.025 to  $0.125~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.001–0.005 in). After the maskant has  hardened, it is cut using a scribing knife and peeled away in the areas of the work  surface that are to be etched. The maskant cutting operation is performed by hand,  usually guiding the knife with a template. The cut and peel method is generally used  for large work parts, low production quantities, and where accuracy is not a critical  factor. This method cannot hold tolerances tighter than  $\pm0.125\ \mathrm{mm}$  ( $\pm0.005$  in)  except with extreme care.  

As the name suggests, the  photographic resist  method (called the  photoresist   method for short) uses photographic techniques to perform the masking step. The  masking materials contain photosensitive chemicals. They are applied to the work sur- face and exposed to light through a negative image of the desired areas to be etched.  These areas of the maskant can then be removed from the surface using photo  graphic  developing techniques. This procedure leaves the desired surfaces of the part pro- tected by the maskant and the remaining areas unprotected, vulnerable to chemical  etching. Photoresist masking techniques are normally applied where small parts are  produced in high quantities, and close tolerances are required. Tolerances closer than  $\pm0.0125\;\mathrm{mm}$  ( $\it{(\pm0.0005}$  in) can be held [18].  

The  screen resist  method applies the maskant by means of silk screening methods.  In these methods, the maskant is painted onto the work part surface through a silk

or stainless steel mesh. Embedded in the mesh is a stencil that protects those areas  to be etched from being painted. The maskant is thus painted onto the work areas  that are not to be etched. The screen resist method is generally used in applications  that are between the other two masking methods in terms of accuracy, part size, and  production quantities. Tolerances of  $\pm0.075\ \mathrm{mm}$  ( $\pm0.003$  in) can be achieved with  this masking method.  

Selection of the  etchant  depends on work material to be etched, desired depth  and rate of material removal, and surface ﬁ  nish requirements. The etchant must  also be matched with the type of maskant that is used to ensure that the maskant  material is not chemically attacked by the etchant. Table 25.2 lists some of the work  materials machined by CHM together with the etchants that are generally used on  these materials. Also included in the table are penetration rates and etch factors.  These parameters are explained next.  

Material removal rates in CHM are generally indicated as penetration rates,  $\mathrm{mm/min}$   $(\mathrm{in}/\mathrm{min})$ , because rate of chemical attack of the work material by the  etchant is directed into the surface. The penetration rate is unaffected by surface  area. Penetration rates listed in Table 25.2 are typical values for the given material  and etchant.  

Depths of cut in chemical machining are as much as  $12.5\;\mathrm{mm}\;(0.5\;\mathrm{in})$  for aircraft  panels made out of metal plates. However, many applications require depths that are  only several hundredths of a millimeter. Along with the penetration into the work,  etching also occurs sideways under the maskant, as illustrated in Figure 25.16. The

FIGURE 25.16  Undercut in chemical machining.  

effect is referred to as the  undercut , and it must be accounted for in the design of the  mask for the resulting cut to have the speciﬁ  ed dimensions. For a given work material,  the undercut is directly related to the depth of cut. The constant of proportionality for  the material is called the etch factor, deﬁ  ned as  

$$
F_{e}={\frac{d}{u}}
$$  

where $F_{e}=$  etch factor;  $d=$  depth of cut, mm (in); and $u=$ undercut, mm (in). The  dimensions  $u$  and  $d$  are deﬁ  ned in Figure 25.16. Different work materials have  different etch factors in chemical machining. Some typical values are presented in  Table 25.2. The etch factor can be used to determine the dimensions of the cutaway  areas in the maskant, so that the speciﬁ  ed dimensions of the etched areas on the  part can be achieved.  

# 25.4.2  CHM PROCESSES  

This section describes the principle chemical machining processes: (1) chemical milling,  (2) chemical blanking, (3) chemical engraving, and (4) photochemical machining.  

Chemical Milling   Chemical milling was the ﬁ  rst CHM process to be commercialized.  During World War II, an aircraft company in the United States began to use chemical  milling to remove metal from aircraft components. They referred to their process as the  “chem-mill” process. Today, chemical milling is still used largely in the aircraft industry,  to remove material from aircraft wing and fuselage panels for weight reduction. It is  applicable to large parts where substantial amounts of metal are removed during the  process. The cut and peel maskant method is employed. A template is generally used  that takes into account the undercut that will result during etching. The sequence of  processing steps is illustrated in Figure 25.17.  

Chemical milling produces a surface ﬁ  nish that varies with different work materials.  Table 25.3 provides a sampling of the values. Surface ﬁ  nish depends on depth of penetra- tion. As depth increases, ﬁ  nish becomes worse, approaching the upper side of the ranges  given in the table. Metallurgical damage from chemical milling is very small, perhaps  around $0.005\:\mathrm{mm}$  (0.0002 in) into the work surface.

Compiled from [8] and [18].  

Chemical Blanking   Chemical blanking uses chemical erosion to cut very thin  sheetmetal parts—down to  $0.025\ \mathrm{mm}$  (0.001 in) thick and/or for intricate cut- ting patterns. In both instances, conventional punch-and-die methods do not work  because the stamping forces damage the sheet metal, or the tooling cost would  be prohibitive, or both. Chemical blanking produces parts that are burr free, an  advantage over conventional shearing operations.  

Methods used for applying the maskant in chemical blanking are either the  photo  resist method or the screen resist method. For small and/or intricate cutting  patterns and close tolerances, the photoresist method is used. Tolerances as close as  $\pm0.0025\:\mathrm{mm}$  ( $\dot{-}0.0001$  in) can be held on  $0.025{\mathrm{-mm}}$  (0.001-in)-thick stock using the  photoresist method of masking. As stock thickness increases, more generous toler- ances must be allowed. Screen resist masking methods are not nearly so accurate  as photoresist. The small work size in chemical blanking excludes the cut and peel  maskant method.  

Using the screen resist method to illustrate, the steps in chemical blanking are  shown in Figure 25.18. Because chemical etching takes place on both sides of the  part in chemical blanking, it is important that the masking procedure provides  accurate registration between the two sides. Otherwise, the erosion into the part  from opposite directions will not line up. This is especially critical with small part  sizes and intricate patterns.  

Application of chemical blanking is generally limited to thin materials and/or  intricate patterns for reasons given above. Maximum stock thickness is around

$0.75\ \mathrm{mm}$  (0.030 in). Also, hardened and brittle materials can be processed by  chemical blanking where mechanical methods would surely fracture the work.  

Chemical Engraving   Chemical engraving is a chemical machining process for  making name plates and other ﬂ  at panels that have lettering and/or artwork on  one side. These plates and panels would otherwise be made using a conventional  engraving machine or similar process. Chemical engraving can be used to make  panels with either recessed lettering or raised lettering, simply by reversing the  portions of the panel to be etched. Masking is done by either the photoresist or  screen resist methods. The sequence in chemical engraving is similar to the other  CHM processes, except that a ﬁ  lling operation follows etching. The purpose of ﬁ  ll- ing is to apply paint or other coating into the recessed areas that have been created  by etching. Then, the panel is immersed in a solution that dissolves the resist but  does not attack the coating material. Thus, when the resist is removed, the coating  remains in the etched areas but not in the areas that were masked. The effect is to  highlight the pattern.  

Photochemical Machining   Photochemical machining (PCM) is chemical machin- ing in which the photoresist method of masking is used. The term can therefore be  applied correctly to chemical blanking and chemical engraving when these methods  use the photographic resist method. PCM is employed in metalworking when close  tolerances and/or intricate patterns are required on ﬂ  at parts. Photochemical processes  are also used extensively in the electronics industry to produce intricate circuit designs  on semiconductor wafers (Section 33.3). Figure 25.19 shows several parts produced by  photochemical blanking and photochemical engraving.

FIGURE 25.20  Sequence of processing steps in photochemical machining: (1) clean raw part, (2) apply resist  (maskant) by dipping, spraying, or painting, (3) place negative on resist, (4) expose to ultraviolet light, (5) develop to  remove resist from areas to be etched, (6) etch (shown partially etched), (7) etch (completed), (8) remove resist and  clean to yield ﬁ  nished part.  

Figure 25.20 shows the sequence of steps in photochemical machining as it is  applied to chemical blanking. There are various ways to photographically expose  the desired image onto the resist. The ﬁ  gure shows the negative in contact with the  surface of the resist during exposure. This is contact printing, but other photo  graphic  printing methods are available that expose the negative through a lens system to  enlarge or reduce the size of the pattern printed on the resist surface. Photoresist  materials in current use are sensitive to ultraviolet light but not to light of other  wavelengths. Therefore, with proper lighting in the factory, there is no need to carry  out the processing steps in a dark room environment. Once the masking operation is  accomplished, the remaining steps in the procedure are similar to the other chemical  machining methods.  

In photochemical machining, the term corresponding to etch factor is  anisotropy which is deﬁ  ned as the depth of cut $d$  divided by the undercut  $u$  (see Figure 25.16).  This is the same deﬁ  nition as in Equation (25.9).  

#  Application Considerations  

Typical applications of nontraditional processes include special geometric features  and work materials that cannot be readily processed by conventional techniques.  This section examines these issues and summarizes the general performance charac- teristics of nontraditional processes.

Work part Geometry and Work Materials   Some of the special work part shapes  for which nontraditional processes are well suited are listed in Table 25.4 along with  the nontraditional processes that are likely to be appropriate.  

As a group, the nontraditional processes can be applied to nearly all work  materials, metals and nonmetals. However, certain processes are not suited to  certain work materials. Table 25.5 relates applicability of the nontraditional  processes to various types of materials. Several of the processes can be used on  metals but not nonmetals. For example, ECM, EDM, and PAM require work  materials that are electrical conductors. This generally limits their applicability

to metal parts. Chemical machining depends on the availability of an appropriate  etchant for the given work material. Because metals are more susceptible to  chemical attack by various etchants, CHM is commonly used to process metals.  With some exceptions, USM, AJM, EBM, and LBM can be used on both metals  and nonmetals. WJC is generally limited to the cutting of plastics, cardboards,  textiles, and other materials that do not possess the strength of metals.  

Performance of Nontraditional Processes   The nontraditional processes are  generally characterized by low material removal rates and high speciﬁ  c energies  relative to conventional machining operations. The capabilities for dimensional  control and surface ﬁ  nish of the nontraditional processes vary widely, with some  of the processes providing high accuracies and good ﬁ  nishes, and others yield- ing poor accuracies and ﬁ  nishes. Surface damage is also a consideration. Some  of these processes produce very little metallurgical damage at and immediately  below the work surface, whereas others (mostly the thermal-based processes) do  considerable damage to the surface. Table 25.6 compares these features of the  prominent nontraditional methods, using conventional milling and surface grind- ing for comparison. Inspection of the data reveals wide differences in machining  characteristics. In comparing the characteristics of nontraditional and conven- tional machining, it must be remembered that nontraditional processes are gener- ally used where conventional methods are not practical or economical.

The  same basic process is also used in arc cutting (Section  25.3.4). A generic AW process is shown in Figure 29.1.  An electric arc is a discharge of electric current across a  gap in a circuit. It is sustained by the presence of a ther- mally ionized column of gas (called a plasma) through  which current ﬂ  ows. To initiate the arc in an AW proc- ess, the electrode is brought into contact with the work  and then quickly separated from it by a short distance.  The electric energy from the arc thus formed produces  temperatures of  $5500^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ $(10{,}000^{\\circ}\\mathrm{F})$  or higher, sufﬁ  - ciently hot to melt any metal. A pool of molten metal,  consisting of base metal(s) and ﬁ  ller metal (if one is  used) is formed near the tip of the electrode. In most  arc-welding processes, ﬁ  ller metal is added during the  operation to increase the volume and strength of the  weld joint. As the electrode is moved along the joint,  the molten weld pool solidiﬁ  es in its wake.  "

Gases used for shielding include inert gases such as  argon and helium, and active gases such as carbon dioxide. Selection of gases (and  mixtures of gases) depends on the metal being welded, as well as other factors. Inert  gases are used for welding aluminum alloys and stainless steels, while  $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  is com- monly used for welding low and medium carbon steels.

The core in this form of  FCAW includes not only ﬂ  uxes but also ingredients that generate shielding gases  for protecting the arc. The second version of FCAW, developed primarily for weld- ing steels, obtains arc shielding from externally supplied gases, similar to gas metal  arc welding. This version is called  gas-shielded ﬂ  ux-cored arc welding .

The  process is primarily applied to vertical butt welding, as pictured in Figure 29.7. When  the ﬂ  ux-cored electrode wire is employed, no external gases are supplied, and the  process can be considered a special application of self-shielded FCAW. When a bare  electrode wire is used with shielding gases from an external source, it is considered  a special case of GMAW. The molding shoes are water cooled to prevent their being  added to the weld pool. Together with the edges of the parts being welded, the shoes  form a container, almost like a mold cavity, into which the molten metal from the  electrode and base parts is gradually added. The process is performed automatically,  with a moving weld head travelling vertically upward to ﬁ  ll the cavity in a single pass. "

Submerged arc welding  (SAW) is an arc- welding process that uses a continuous, consumable bare wire electrode, and arc  shielding is provided by a cover of granular ﬂ  ux. The electrode wire is fed automati- cally from a coil into the arc. The ﬂ  ux is introduced into the joint slightly ahead of the  weld arc by gravity from a hopper, as shown in Figure 29.8. The blanket of granular  ﬂ  ux completely submerges the welding operation, preventing sparks, spatter, and  radiation that are so hazardous in other AW processes. Thus, the welding operator  in SAW need not wear the somewhat cumbersome face shield required in the other  operations (safety glasses and protective gloves, of course, are required). The por- tion of the ﬂ  ux closest to the arc is melted, mixing with the molten weld metal to  remove impurities and then solidifying on top of the weld joint to form a glass-like  slag. The slag and unfused ﬂ  ux granules on top provide good protection from the at- mosphere and good thermal insulation for the weld area, resulting in relatively slow  cooling and a high-quality weld joint, noted for toughness and ductility. As depicted  in the sketch, the unfused ﬂ  ux remaining after welding can be recovered and reused.  The solid slag covering the weld must be chipped away, usually by manual means. "

Low-carbon, low-alloy, and stainless steels can be  readily welded by SAW; but not high-carbon steels, tool steels, and most nonferrous  metals. Because of the gravity feed of the granular ﬂ  ux, the parts must always be in a  horizontal orientation, and a backup plate is often required beneath the joint during  the welding operation. "

The ideal situation is for  the faying surfaces to be the largest resistance in the sum, because this is the desired  location of the weld. The resistance of the electrodes is minimized by using metals  with very low resistivities, such as copper. Also, the electrodes are often water cooled  to dissipate the heat that is generated there. The work part resistances are a function  of the resistivities of the base metals and the part thicknesses. The contact resist- ances between the electrodes and the parts are determined by the contact areas (i.e.,  size and shape of the electrode) and the condition of the surfaces (e.g., cleanliness  of the work surfaces and scale on the electrode). Finally, the resistance at the faying  surfaces depends on surface ﬁ  nish, cleanliness, contact area, and pressure.

When  ﬁ  rst developed, welding had to be carried out in a vacuum chamber to minimize  the disruption of the electron beam by air molecules. This requirement was, and  still is, a serious inconvenience in production, due to the time required to evacu- ate the chamber prior to welding. The pump-down time, as it is called, can take  as long as an hour, depending on the size of the chamber and the level of vacuum  required. Today, EBW technology has progressed to where some operations are  performed without a vacuum. Three categories can be distinguished: (1)  high- vacuum welding  (EBW-HV), in which welding is carried out in the same vacu- um as beam generation; (2)  medium-vacuum welding  (EBW-MV), in which the  operation is performed in a separate chamber where only a partial vacuum is  achieved; and (3)  nonvacuum welding  (EBW-NV), in which welding is accom- plished at or near atmospheric pressure. The pump-down time during work part  loading and unloading is reduced in medium-vacuum EBW and minimized in  nonvacuum EBW, but there is a price paid for this advantage. In the latter two  operations, the equipment must include one or more vacuum dividers (very small  oriﬁ  ces that impede air ﬂ  ow but permit passage of the electron beam) to sepa- rate the beam generator (which requires a high vacuum) from the work chamber.  Also, in nonvacuum EBW, the work must be located close to the oriﬁ  ce of the  electron beam gun, approximately  $13~\\mathrm{mm}$  (0.5 in) or less. Finally, the lower vac- uum processes cannot achieve the high weld qualities and depth-to-width ratios  accomplished by EBW-HV. "

Then the parts are driven toward each other with sufﬁ  cient force to form  a metallurgical bond. The sequence is portrayed in Figure 29.28 for welding two cy- lindrical parts, the typical application. The axial compression force upsets the parts,  and a ﬂ  ash is produced by the material displaced. Any surface ﬁ  lms that may have  been on the contacting surfaces are expunged during the process. The ﬂ  ash must  be subsequently trimmed (e.g., by turning) to provide a smooth surface in the weld  region. When properly carried out, no melting occurs at the faying surfaces.

        "text": "The situation in welding is complicated because (1) heating is very localized,  (2) melting of the base metals occurs in these local regions, and (3) the location of  heating and melting is in motion (at least in arc welding). Consider the butt welding  of two plates by arc-welding shown in Figure 29.32(a). The operation begins at one  end and travels to the opposite end. As it proceeds, a molten pool is formed from  the base metal (and ﬁ  ller metal, if used) that quickly solidiﬁ  es behind the mov- ing arc. The portions of the work immediately adjacent to the weld bead become  extremely hot and expand, while portions removed from the weld remain relatively  cool. The weld pool quickly solidiﬁ  es in the cavity between the two parts, and as it  and the surrounding metal cool and contract, shrinkage occurs across the width of  the weldment, as seen in Figure 29.32(b). The weld seam is left in residual tension,  and reactionary compressive stresses are set up in regions of the parts away from  the weld. Residual stresses and shrinkage also occurs along the length of the weld  bead. Because the outer regions of the base parts have remained relatively cool  and dimensionally unchanged, while the weld bead has solidiﬁ  ed from very high  tempera  tures and then contracted, residual tensile stresses remain longitudinally  in the weld bead. These transverse and longitudinal stress patterns are depicted in  Figure 29.32(c). The net result of these residual stresses, transversely and longitudi- nally, is likely to cause warping in the welded assembly as shown in Figure 29.32(d). "

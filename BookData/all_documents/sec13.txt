 13.12 Product Design Considerations  

Plastics can be shaped into a wide variety of prod- ucts, such as molded parts, extruded sections, ﬁ  lms and  sheets, insulation coatings on electrical wires, and ﬁ  bers  for textiles. In addition, plastics are often the principal  ingredient in other materials, such as paints and var- nishes, adhesives, and various polymer matrix compos- ites. This chapter considers the technologies by which  these products are shaped, postponing paints and var- nishes, adhesives, and composites until later chapters.  Many plastic-shaping processes can be adapted to poly- mer matrix composites and rubbers (Chapter 14).  

The commercial and technological importance of  these shaping processes derives from the growing im- portance of the materials being processed. Applications  of plastics have increased at a much faster rate than ei- ther metals or ceramics during the last 50 years. Indeed,  many parts previously made of metals are today being  made of plastics and plastic composites. The same is  true of glass; plastic containers have been largely sub- stituted for glass bottles and jars in product packaging.  The total volume of polymers (plastics and rubbers)  now exceeds that of metals. There are several reasons  why the plastic-shaping processes are important:  

$\gg$ The variety of shaping processes, and the ease with  which polymers can be processed, allows an almost  unlimited variety of part geometries to be formed.

 $\gg$   Many plastic parts are formed by molding, which  is a  net shape  process. Further shaping is generally  not needed.

 $\gg$   Although heating is usually required to form plas- tics, less energy is required than for metals because  the processing temperatures are much lower.

 $\gg$   Because lower temperatures are used in processing,  handling of the product is simpliﬁ  ed during produc- tion. Because many plastic processing methods are  one-step operations (e.g., molding), the amount of product handling required is  substantially reduced compared with metals.  

➢   Finishing by painting or plating is not required (except in unusual circumstances)  for plastics.  

As discussed in Chapter 8, the two types of plastics are  thermoplastics  and  ther- mosets . The difference is that thermosets undergo a curing process during heating  and shaping, which causes a permanent chemical change ( cross-linking ) in their  molecular structure. Once they have been cured, they cannot be melted through  reheating. By contrast, thermoplastics do not cure, and their chemical structure  remains basically unchanged upon reheating even though they transform from solid  to ﬂ  uid. Of the two types, thermoplastics are by far the more important type com- mercially, comprising more than  $80\%$  of the total plastics tonnage.  

Plastic-shaping processes can be classiﬁ  ed as follows according to the result- ing product geometry: (1) continuous extruded products with constant cross sec- tion other than sheets, ﬁ  lms, and ﬁ  laments; (2) continuous sheets and ﬁ  lms; (3)  continuous ﬁ  laments (ﬁ  bers); (4) molded parts that are mostly solid; (5) hollow  molded parts with relatively thin walls; (6) discrete parts made of formed sheets  and ﬁ  lms; (7) castings; and (8) foamed products. This chapter examines each of  these categories. The most important processes commercially are those associ- ated with thermoplastics; the two processes of greatest signiﬁ  cance are extrusion  and injection molding. A brief history of plastic-shaping processes is presented in  Historical Note 13.1.  

Coverage of the plastic-shaping processes begins by examining the properties of  polymer melts, because nearly all of the thermoplastic shaping processes share the  common step of heating the plastic so that it ﬂ  ows.  

# Historical Note 13.1  Plastic shaping processes  

Equipment for shaping plastics evolved largely  from rubber processing technology. Noteworthy  among the early contributors was Edwin Chaffee, an  American who developed a two-roll steam-heated  mill for mixing additives into rubber around 1835  (Section 14.5.2). He was also responsible for a simi- lar device called a calender, which consists of a series  of heated rolls for coating rubber onto cloth (Section  13.3). Both machines are still used today for plastics  as well as rubbers.  

The ﬁ  rst extruders, dating from around 1845 in  England, were ram-driven machines for extruding  rubber and coating rubber onto electrical wire. The  trouble with ram-type extruders is that they oper- ate in an intermittent fashion. An extruder that could  operate continuously, especially for wire and cable  coating, was highly desirable. Although several indi- viduals worked with varying degrees of success on  a screw-type extruder (Section 13.2.1), Mathew Gray  in England is credited with the invention; his patent  is dated 1879. As thermoplastics were subsequently  developed, these screw extruders, originally designed  for rubber, were adapted. An extrusion machine spe- ciﬁ  cally designed for thermoplastics was introduced  in 1935.  

Injection molding machines for plastics were adap- tations of equipment designed for metal die casting  (Historical Note 11.2). Around 1872, John Hyatt, an im- portant ﬁ  gure in the development of plastics (Histori- cal Note 8.1), patented a molding machine speciﬁ  cally  for plastics. It was a plunger-type machine (Section  13.6.3). The injection molding machine in its modern  form was introduced in 1921, with semiautomatic  controls added in 1937 . Ram-type machines were the  standard in the plastic molding industry for many dec- ades, until the superiority of the reciprocating screw  machine, developed by William Willert in the United  States in 1952, became obvious.  

#  Properties of Polymer Melts  

To shape a thermoplastic polymer it must be heated so that it softens to the consist- ency of a liquid. In this form, it is called a  polymer melt . Polymer melts exhibit several  unique properties and characteristics, considered in this section.  

Viscosity   Because of its high molecular weight, a polymer melt is a thick ﬂ  uid  with high viscosity. As the term is deﬁ  ned in Section 3.4,  viscosity  is a ﬂ  uid prop- erty that relates the shear stress experienced during ﬂ  ow of the ﬂ  uid to the rate of  shear. Viscosity is important in polymer processing because most of the shaping  methods involve ﬂ  ow of the polymer melt through small channels or die open- ings. The ﬂ  ow rates are often large, thus leading to high rates of shear; and the  shear stresses increase with shear rate, so that signiﬁ  cant pressures are required to  accomplish the processes.  

Figure 13.1 shows viscosity as a function of shear rate for two types of ﬂ  uids. For a  Newtonian ﬂ  uid  (which includes most simple ﬂ  uids such as water and oil), viscosity  is a constant at a given temperature; it does not change with shear rate. The rela- tionship between shear stress and shear strain is proportional, with viscosity as the  constant of proportionality:  

$$
\tau=\eta\dot{\gamma}\quad\mathrm{or}\quad\eta=\frac{\tau}{\dot{\gamma}}
$$  

where  $\tau=$  shear stress, Pa  $\left(1\mathbf{b}/\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ ; $\eta=$  coefﬁ  cient of shear viscosity, $\mathrm{{Ns}}/\mathrm{{m}}^{2}$ , or Pa-s  $(|\mathbf{b}|.\mathrm{sec}/\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $\dot{\gamma}=$  shear rate, 1/s (1/sec). However, for a polymer melt, viscosity  decreases with shear rate, indicating that the ﬂ  uid becomes thinner at higher rates of  shear. This behavior is called  pseudo plasticity  and can be modeled to a reasonable  approximation by the expression  

$$
\tau=k(\dot{\gamma})^{n}
$$  

where  $k\,=\,\mathrm{a}$  constant corresponding to the viscosity coefﬁ  cient and  $n\ =$ ﬂ  ow  behavior index. For  $n=1$ , the equation reduces to the previous Equation (13.1)  for a Newtonian ﬂ  uid, and $k$  becomes  . For a polymer melt, values of   are less  $\eta$ $n$ than 1.  

In addition to the effect of shear rate (ﬂ  uid ﬂ  ow rate), viscosity of a poly- mer melt is also affected by temperature. Like most ﬂ  uids, the value decreases  with increasing temperature. This is shown in Figure 13.2 for several common  

![](images/ee0758d97a36c32802655953c75ef8a97c13d8573f6f7ab3e658395f69c44e2b.jpg)

polymers at a shear rate of  $10^{3}~\mathrm{{s}^{-1}}$ , which is approximately the same as the rates  encountered in injection molding and high speed extrusion. Thus, the viscosity of  a polymer melt decreases with increasing values of shear rate and temperature.  Equation (13.2) can be applied, except that  $k$  depends on temperature as shown  in Figure 13.2.  

Viscoelasticity   Another property possessed by polymer melts is viscoelasticity,  which was discussed in the context of solid polymers in Section 3.5. However, liq- uid polymers exhibit it also. A good example is  die swell  in extrusion, in which the  hot plastic expands when exiting the die opening. The phenomenon, illustrated in  Figure 13.3, can be explained by noting that the polymer was contained in a much  larger cross section before entering the narrow die channel. In effect, the extruded  material “remembers” its former shape and attempts to return to it after leaving  the die oriﬁ  ce. More technically, the compressive stresses acting on the material as  it enters the small die opening do not relax immediately. When the material subse- quently exits the oriﬁ  ce and the restriction is removed, the unrelaxed stresses cause  the cross section to expand.  

![](images/b674622316ce16e7e04dfc89d2337ed3df6c6431003bbfbb19f55776fb7cc6b1.jpg)  
FIGURE 13.3  Die  swell, a manifestation of  viscoelasticity in  polymer melts, as  depicted here on exiting  an extrusion die.  

Die swell can be most easily measured for a circular cross section by means of the  swell ratio , deﬁ  ned as  

$$
r_{s}=\frac{D_{x}}{D_{d}}
$$  

where $r_{s}=\mathrm{swell}$  ratio;  $D_{x}=$  diameter of the extruded cross section,  $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and  $D_{d}=$  diameter of the die oriﬁ  ce, mm (in). The amount of die swell depends on the  time the polymer melt spends in the die channel. Increasing the time in the chan- nel, by means of a longer channel, reduces die swell.  

Extrusion is one of the fundamental shaping processes, for metals and ceramics as  well as polymers.  Extrusion  is a compression process in which material is forced to  ﬂ  ow through a die oriﬁ  ce to provide long continuous product whose cross-sectional  shape is determined by the shape of the oriﬁ  ce. As a polymer shaping process, it is  widely used for thermoplastics and elastomers (but rarely for thermosets) to mass  produce items such as tubing, pipes, hose, structural shapes (such as window and  door moldings), sheet and ﬁ  lm, continuous ﬁ  laments, and coated electrical wire and  cable. For these types of products, extrusion is carried out as a continuous process;  the  extrudate  (extruded product) is subsequently cut into desired lengths. This sec- tion covers the basic extrusion process, and several subsequent sections examine  processes based on extrusion.  

# 13.2.1  PROCESS AND EQUIPMENT  

In polymer extrusion, feedstock in pellet or powder form is fed into an extrusion  barrel where it is heated and melted and forced to ﬂ  ow through a die opening by  means of a rotating screw, as illustrated in Figure 13.4. The two main components  of the extruder are the barrel and the screw. The die is not a component of the  extruder; it is a special tool that must be fabricated for the particular proﬁ  le to  be produced.  

![](images/c70bd3adf00048e125447171c0065a8a9d8ee8c50e11427c2e87c1cfc4cca4b7.jpg)  
FIGURE 13.4  Components and features of a single-screw extruder for plastics and elastomers.  

The internal diameter of the extruder barrel typically ranges from 25 to  $150\:\mathrm{mm}$ (1.0–6.0 in). The barrel is long relative to its diameter, with  $L/D$  ratios usually  between 10 and 30. The  $L/D$  ratio is reduced in Figure 13.4 for clarity of draw- ing. The higher ratios are used for thermoplastic materials, whereas lower $L/D$  val- ues are for elastomers. A hopper containing the feedstock is located at the end of  the barrel opposite the die. The pellets are fed by gravity onto the rotating screw  whose turning moves the material along the barrel. Electric heaters are used to  initially melt the solid pellets; subsequent mixing and mechanical working of the  material generate additional heat, which maintains the melt. In some cases, enough  heat is supplied through the mixing and shearing action that external heating is not  required. Indeed, in some cases the barrel must be externally cooled to prevent  overheating of the polymer.  

The material is conveyed through the barrel toward the die opening by the  action of the extruder screw, which rotates at about 60 rev/min. The screw serves  several functions and is divided into sections that correspond to these functions.  The sections and functions are the (1)  feed section , in which the stock is moved  from the hopper port and preheated; (2)  compression section , where the polymer is  transformed into liquid consistency, air entrapped amongst the pellets is extracted  from the melt, and the material is compressed; and (3)  metering section , in which  the melt is homogenized and sufﬁ  cient pressure is developed to pump it through  the die opening.  

The operation of the screw is determined by its geometry and speed of rotation.  Typical extruder screw geometry is depicted in Figure 13.5. The screw consists of  spiraled “ﬂ  ights” (threads) with channels between them through which the polymer  melt is moved. The channel has a width  $w_{c}$  and depth  $d_{c}$ . As the screw rotates, the  ﬂ  ights push the material forward through the channel from the hopper end of the  barrel toward the die. Although not discernible in the diagram, the ﬂ  ight diameter  is smaller than the barrel diameter $D$  by a very small clearance—around  $0.05\;\mathrm{mm}$ (0.002 in). The function of the clearance is to limit leakage of the melt backward to  the trailing channel. The ﬂ  ight land has a width $w_{f}$  and is made of hardened steel to  resist wear as it turns and rubs against the inside of the barrel. The screw has a pitch

whose value is usually close to the diameter  $D$ . The ﬂ  ight angle  $A$  is the helix angle  of the screw and can be determined from the relation  

$$
\tan A={\frac{p}{\pi D}}
$$  

where $p=$  pitch of the screw.  

The increase in pressure applied to the polymer melt in the three sections of the  barrel is determined largely by the channel depth  $d_{c}$ . In Figure 13.4,  $d_{c}$  is relatively  large in the feed section to allow large amounts of granular polymer to be admitted  into the barrel. In the compression section,  $d_{c}$  is gradually reduced, thus applying  increased pressure on the polymer as it melts. In the metering section,  $d_{c}$  is small and  pressure reaches a maximum as ﬂ  ow is restrained at the die end of the barrel. The  three sections of the screw are shown as being about equal in length in Figure 13.4;  this is appropriate for a polymer that melts gradually, such as low-density polyeth- ylene. For other polymers, the optimal section lengths are different. For crystalline  polymers such as nylon, melting occurs rather abruptly at a speciﬁ  c melting point;  therefore, a short compression section is appropriate. Amorphous polymers such  as polyvinyl chloride melt more slowly than LDPE, and the compression zone for  these materials must take almost the entire length of the screw. Although the opti- mal screw design for each material type is different, it is common practice to use  general-purpose screws. These designs represent a compromise among the different  materials, and they avoid the need to make frequent screw changes, which result in  costly equipment downtime.  

Progress of the polymer along the barrel leads ultimately to the die zone. Before  reaching the die, the melt passes through a screen pack—a series of wire meshes  supported by a stiff plate (called a  breaker plate ) containing small axial holes. The  screen pack assembly functions to (1) ﬁ  lter contaminants and hard lumps from the  melt; (2) build pressure in the metering section; and (3) straighten the ﬂ  ow of the  polymer melt and remove its “memory” of the circular motion imposed by the screw.  This last function is concerned with the polymer’s viscoelastic property; if the ﬂ  ow  were left unstraightened, the polymer would play back its history of turning inside  the extrusion chamber, tending to twist and distort the extrudate.  

# 13.2.2  ANALYSIS OF EXTRUSION  

In this section, mathematical models are developed to describe, in a simpliﬁ  ed way,  several aspects of polymer extrusion.  

Melt Flow in the Extruder   As the screw rotates inside the barrel, the polymer  melt is forced to move forward toward the die; the system operates much like an  Archimedean screw. The principal transport mechanism is  drag ﬂ  ow , resulting from  friction between the viscous liquid and two opposing surfaces moving relative to  each other: (1) the stationary barrel and (2) the channel of the turning screw. The  arrangement can be likened to the ﬂ  uid ﬂ  ow that occurs between a stationary plate  and a moving plate separated by a viscous liquid, as illustrated in Figure 3.17. Given  that the moving plate has a velocity $\nu$ , it can be reasoned that the average velocity of  the ﬂ  uid is $\nu/2$ , resulting in a volume ﬂ  ow rate of  

$$
Q_{d}=0.5\,\nu\,d\,w
$$  

where  $Q_{d}=$  volume drag ﬂ  ow rate, $\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{s}$   $(\mathrm{in}^{3}/\mathrm{sec}.)$ );  $\nu=$  velocity of the moving plate,  $\mathrm{m/s}$  (in/sec.); $d=$  distance separating the two plates, m (in); and  $w=$  the width of  the plates perpendicular to velocity direction, m (in). These parameters can be com- pared with those in the channel deﬁ  ned by the rotating extrusion screw and the  stationary barrel surface.  

where  $D\,=$  screw ﬂ  ight diameter, m (in);  $N=$  screw rotational speed, rev/s;  $d_{c}=$ screw channel depth, m (in); $w_{c}=$ screw channel width, m (in); $A=$  ﬂ  ight angle; and  $\boldsymbol{w}_{f}=$  ﬂ  ight land width,  $\mathrm{m}$  (in). If the ﬂ  ight land width is assumed to be negligibly  small, then the last of these equations reduces to  

$$
w_{c}=\pi\,D\,\tan A\,\cos A=\pi\,D\,\sin A
$$  

Substituting Equations (13.6), (13.7), and (13.9) into Equation (13.5), and using sev- eral trigonometric identities,  

$$
Q_{d}=0.5\:\pi^{2}\,D^{2}\,N\,d_{c}\sin{A}\cos{A}
$$  

If no forces were present to resist the forward motion of the ﬂ  uid, this equation  would provide a reasonable description of the melt ﬂ  ow rate inside the extruder.  However, compressing the polymer melt through the downstream die creates a  back  pressure  in the barrel that reduces the material moved by drag ﬂ  ow in Equation  (13.10). This ﬂ  ow reduction, called the  back pressure ﬂ  ow , depends on the screw  dimensions, viscosity of the polymer melt, and pressure gradient along the barrel.  These dependencies can be summarized in this equation [12]:  

$$
Q_{b}=\frac{\pi D d_{c}^{3}\sin^{2}A}{12\eta}\left(\frac{d p}{d l}\right)
$$  

where  $Q_{b}\,=$  back pressure ﬂ  ow,  $\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{s}$   $\mathrm{(in}^{3}/\mathrm{sec)}$ ;  $\eta\:=\:$ viscosity,  $\mathbf{N}\mathbf{-}\mathbf{s}/\mathbf{m}^{2}$  (lb-sec/in 2 );  $d p/d l=$  the pressure gradient,  $\mathrm{{MPa}/\mathrm{{m}\ (l b/i n^{2}/i n)}}$ ; and the other terms were previ- ously deﬁ  ned. The actual pressure gradient in the barrel is a function of the shape  of the screw over its length; a typical pressure proﬁ  le is given in Figure 13.6. If the  proﬁ  le is assumed to be a straight line, indicated by the dashed line in the ﬁ  gure, then  the pressure gradient becomes a constant $p/L$ , and the previous equation reduces to  

$$
Q_{b}=\frac{p\pi D d_{c}^{3}\sin^{2}A}{12\eta L}
$$  

where $p\,=$  head pressure in the barrel, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ; and  $L=$ length of the barrel,  m (in). Recall that this back pressure ﬂ  ow is really not an actual ﬂ  ow by itself; it is a  

![](images/d8632babe5ea3fe709a92579222e33a368526abb5d4bbb8fb6a2b64819716001.jpg)  
FIGURE 13.6  Typical pressure  gradient in an extruder; dashed line  indicates a straight line approximation  to facilitate computations.  

reduction in the drag ﬂ  ow. Thus, the magnitude of the melt ﬂ  ow in an extruder can be  computed as the difference between the drag ﬂ  ow and back pressure ﬂ  ow:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{Q_{x}=Q_{d}-Q_{b}}\\ {Q_{x}=0.5\:\pi^{2}\:D^{2}\:N\,d_{c}\sin{A}\:\cos{A}-\:\displaystyle\frac{p\pi D d_{c}^{3}\sin^{2}{A}}{12\eta L}}\end{array}
$$  

where  $Q_{x}=$  the resulting ﬂ  ow rate of polymer melt in the extruder. Equation (13.13)  assumes that there is minimal  leak ﬂ  ow  through the clearance between ﬂ  ights and  barrel. Leak ﬂ  ow of melt will be small compared with drag and back pressure ﬂ  ow  except in badly worn extruders.  

Equation (13.13) contains many parameters, which can be divided into two types:  (1) design parameters, and (2) operating parameters. The design parameters deﬁ  ne  the geometry of the screw and barrel: diameter  $D$ , length  $L$ , channel depth  $d_{c}$ , and  helix angle $A$ . For a given extruder operation, these factors cannot be changed during  the process. The operating parameters can be changed during the process to affect  output ﬂ  ow; they include rotational speed $N$ , head pressure $p$ , and melt viscosity  $\eta$ .  Of course, melt viscosity is controllable only to the extent to which temperature and  shear rate can be manipulated to affect this property. The following example shows  how the parameters play out their roles.  

# Example 13.1  Extrusion ﬂ  ow  rates  

An extruder barrel has a diameter $D=75\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The screw rotates at $N=1$   rev/s. Channel depth $d_{c}=6.0\:\mathrm{mm}$  and ﬂ  ight angle $A=20^{\circ}$ . Head pressure  at the end of the barrel $p=7.0\times10^{6}$  Pa, length of the barrel  $L=1.9\,\mathrm{m}$ , and  viscosity of the polymer melt is assumed to be  $\eta=100\:\mathrm{Pa-s}.$  Determine the  volume ﬂ  ow rate of the plastic in the barrel  $Q_{x}$ .  

Solution:   Equation (13.13) can be used to compute the drag ﬂ  ow and  opposing back pressure ﬂ  ow in the barrel.  

$$
Q_{d}=0.5\;\pi^{2}(75\times10^{-3})^{2}\:(1.0)\:(6\times10^{-3})\:(\sin{20})\:(\cos{20})=53,525\:(10^{-9})\:\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{s}
$$
 
$$
Q_{b}={\frac{\pi(7\times10^{6})(75\times10^{-3})(6\times10^{-3})^{3}\,(\sin20)^{2}}{12(100)(1.9)}}=18.276(10^{-6})=18,276(10^{-9})\,{\mathrm{m}}^{3}/{\mathrm{s}}
$$
 
$$
Q_{x}=Q_{d}-Q_{b}=(53{,}525-18{,}276)\;(10^{-9})=35{,}249(10^{-9})\;\mathrm{m^{3}/s}
$$  

Extruder and Die Characteristics  If back pressure is zero, so that melt ﬂ  ow  is unrestrained in the extruder, then the ﬂ  ow would equal drag ﬂ  ow  $Q_{d}$  given by  Equation (13.10). Given the design and operating parameters  $(D,A,N)$ , etc.), this is  the maximum possible ﬂ  ow capacity of the extruder. Denote it as  $Q_{\mathrm{max}}$ :  

$$
{\mathcal{Q}}_{\operatorname*{max}}=0.5\pi^{2}\,D^{2}\,N\,d_{c}\sin A\cos A
$$  

On the other hand, if back pressure were so great as to cause zero ﬂ  ow, then back  pressure ﬂ  ow would equal drag ﬂ  ow; that is,  

$$
Q_{x}=Q_{d}-Q_{b}=0,\mathrm{{so}}\ Q_{d}=Q_{b}
$$  

Using the expressions for $Q_{d}$  and $Q_{b}$  in Equation (13.13), we can solve for $p$  to deter- mine what this maximum head pressure $p_{\mathrm{max}}$  would have to be to cause no ﬂ  ow in  the extruder:  

$$
p_{\operatorname*{max}}=\frac{6\pi D N L\eta\cot A}{d_{c}^{2}}
$$  

The two values $Q_{\mathrm{max}}$  and $p_{\mathrm{max}}$  are points along the axes of a diagram known as the  extruder characteristic  (or  screw characteristic ), as in Figure 13.7. It deﬁ  nes the rela- tionship between head pressure and ﬂ  ow rate in an extrusion machine with given  operating parameters.  

With a die in the machine and the extrusion process underway, the actual values  of $Q_{x}$  and $p$  will lie somewhere between the extreme values, the location determined  by the characteristics of the die. Flow rate through the die depends on the size and  shape of the opening and the pressure applied to force the melt through it. This can  be expressed as  

$$
Q_{x}=K_{s}p
$$  

where  $Q_{x}=$  ﬂ  ow rate, $\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{s}$  (in 3 /sec.); $p=$  head pressure, Pa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ; and  $K_{s}=$  shape  factor for the die, $\mathrm{{m}^{5}/\mathrm{{Nu}}}$  (in 5 /lb-sec). For a circular die opening of a given channel  length, the shape factor can be computed [12] as  

$$
K_{s}=\frac{\pi D_{d}^{4}}{128\eta L_{d}}
$$  

where  $D_{d}=$  die opening diameter, $\mathrm{m}$  (in)  $\eta=$ melt viscosity,  $\mathrm{N}.\mathrm{s}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  (lb-sec/in 2 ); and  $L_{d}=$  die opening length, $\mathrm{m}$  (in). For shapes other than round, the die shape factor is  less than for a round of the same cross-sectional area, meaning that greater pressure  is required to achieve the same ﬂ  ow rate.

FIGURE 13.7  Extruder  characteristic (also called the  screw characteristic) and die  characteristic. The extruder  operating point is at intersection  of the two lines.  

The relationship between  $Q_{x}$  and $p$  in Equation (13.16) is called the  die charac- teristic . In Figure 13.7, this is drawn as a straight line that intersects with the previous  extruder characteristic. The intersection point identiﬁ  es the values of  $Q_{x}$  and $p$  that  are known as the  operating point  for the extrusion process.

Determine (a)  $Q_{\mathrm{max}}$  and $p_{\mathrm{max}}$ , (b) shape factor $K_{s}$  for a circular  die opening in which $D_{d}=6.5\;\mathrm{mm}$  and  $L_{d}=20\,\mathrm{mm}$ , and (c) values of  $Q_{x}$   and $p$  at the operating point.  

# Solution: (a) $\mathbb{Q}_{\mathsf{m o x}}$  is given by Equation (13.14).  

$p_{\mathrm{max}}$  is given by Equation (13.15).  

$$
P_{\operatorname*{max}}={\frac{6\pi D N L\eta\cot A}{d_{c}^{2}}}={\frac{6\pi(75\times10^{-3})(1.9)(1.0)(100)\cot20}{(6\times10^{-3})^{2}}}=20,\!499,\!874\,\mathrm{Pa}
$$  

These two values deﬁ  ne the intersection with the ordinate and abscissa for the  extruder characteristic.  

(b) The shape factor for a circular die opening with $D_{d}=6.5\:\mathrm{mm}$  and  $L_{d}=20\,\mathrm{mm}$   can be determined from Equation (13.17).  

$$
K_{s}=\frac{\pi(6.5\times10^{-3})^{4}}{128(100)(20\times10^{-3})}=21.9(10^{-12})\;\mathrm{m}^{5}/\mathrm{N}\mathrm{s}
$$  

This shape factor deﬁ  nes the slope of the die characteristic.  

(c) The operating point is deﬁ  ned by the values of  $Q_{x}$  and $p$  at which the screw  characteristic intersects with the die characteristic. The screw characteristic can  be expressed as the equation of the straight line between  $Q_{\mathrm{max}}$  and $p_{\mathrm{max}}$ , which is  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{Q_{x}=Q_{\operatorname*{max}}-(Q_{\operatorname*{max}}/p_{\operatorname*{max}})p}\\ &{\quad=53{,}525(10^{-9})-(53{,}525(10^{-9})/20{,}499{,}874)p}\\ &{\quad=53{,}525(10^{-9})-2{.}611(10^{-12})p}\end{array}
$$  

The die characteristic is given by Equation (13.16) using the value of  $K_{s}$ computed in part (b).  

$$
Q_{x}=21.9(10^{-12})p
$$  

Setting the two equations equal,  

Solving for  $Q_{x}$  using one of the starting equations,  

$$
Q_{x}=53.525(10^{-6})-2.611(10^{-12})(2.184)(10^{6})=47.822(10^{-6})~\mathbf{m}^{3}/\mathbf{s}
$$  

Checking this with the other equation for veriﬁ  cation,  

$$
Q_{x}=21.9(10^{-12})(2.184)(10^{6})=47.82(10^{-6})\;\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{s}
$$  

# 13.2.3  DIE CONFIGURATIONS AND EXTRUDED PRODUCTS  

The shape of the die oriﬁ  ce determines the cross-sectional shape of the extrudate.  The common die proﬁ  les and corresponding extruded shapes are: (1) solid pro- ﬁ  les; (2) hollow proﬁ  les, such as tubes; (3) wire and cable coating; (4) sheet and  ﬁ  lm; and (5) ﬁ  laments. The ﬁ  rst three categories are covered in the present section.  Methods for producing sheet and ﬁ  lm are examined in Section 13.3; and ﬁ  lament  production is discussed in Section 13.4. These latter shapes sometimes involve  forming processes other than extrusion.  

Solid Proﬁ  les   Solid proﬁ  les include regular shapes such as rounds and squares and  irregular cross sections such as structural shapes, door and window moldings, automo- bile trim, and house siding. The side view cross section of a die for these solid shapes  is illustrated in Figure 13.8. Just beyond the end of the screw and before the die, the  polymer melt passes through the screen pack and breaker plate to straighten the ﬂ  ow  lines. Then it ﬂ  ows into a (usually) converging die entrance, the shape designed to  maintain laminar ﬂ  ow and avoid dead spots in the corners that would otherwise be  present near the oriﬁ  ce. The melt then ﬂ  ows through the die opening itself.  

When the material exits the die, it is still soft. Polymers with high melt viscosities  are the best candidates for extrusion, because they hold shape better during cooling.  Cooling is accomplished by air blowing, water spray, or passing the extrudate through  a water trough. To compensate for die swell, the die opening is made long enough to  remove some of the memory in the polymer melt. In addition, the extrudate is often  drawn (stretched) to offset expansion from die swell.  

For shapes other than round, the die opening is designed with a cross section that  is slightly different from the desired proﬁ  le, so that the effect of die swell is to provide  shape correction. This correction is illustrated in Figure 13.9 for a square cross sec- tion. Because different polymers exhibit varying degrees of die swell, the shape of the  die proﬁ  le depends on the material to be extruded. Considerable skill and judgment  are required by the die designer for complex cross sections.  

Hollow Proﬁ  les   Extrusion of hollow proﬁ  les, such as tubes, pipes, hoses, and  other cross sections containing holes, requires a mandrel to form the hollow shape.

FIGURE 13.9  (a) Die cross section  showing required oriﬁ  ce proﬁ  le to  obtain (b) a square extruded proﬁ  le.  

A typical die conﬁ  guration is shown in Figure 13.10. The mandrel is held in place  using a spider, seen in Section A-A of the ﬁ  gure. The polymer melt ﬂ  ows around  the legs supporting the mandrel to reunite into a monolithic tube wall. The man- drel often includes an air channel through which air is blown to maintain the hol- low form of the extrudate during hardening. Pipes and tubes are cooled using open  water troughs or by pulling the soft extrudate through a water-ﬁ  lled tank with sizing  sleeves that limit the OD of the tube while air pressure is maintained on the inside.  

Wire and Cable Coating   The coating of wire and cable for insulation is one of  the most important polymer extrusion processes. As shown in Figure 13.11 for wire  coating, the polymer melt is applied to the bare wire as it is pulled at high speed  through a die. A slight vacuum is drawn between the wire and the polymer to pro- mote adhesion of the coating. The taught wire provides rigidity during cooling, which  is usually aided by passing the coated wire through a water trough. The product is  wound onto large spools at speeds of up to $50\,\mathrm{m/s}$   $(10{,}000\,\mathrm{ft/min})$ ).

# 13.2.4  DEFECTS IN EXTRUSION  

A number of defects can afﬂ  ict extruded products. One of the worst is  melt frac- ture , in which the stresses acting on the melt immediately before and during its  ﬂ  ow through the die are so high as to cause failure, manifested in the form of a  highly irregular surface on the extrudate. As suggested by Figure 13.12, melt frac- ture can be caused by a sharp reduction at the die entrance, causing turbulent ﬂ  ow  that breaks up the melt. This contrasts with the streamlined, laminar ﬂ  ow in the  gradually converging die in Figure 13.8.  

A more common defect in extrusion is  sharkskin , in which the surface of the  product becomes roughened upon exiting the die. As the melt ﬂ  ows through the die  opening, friction at the interface results in a velocity proﬁ  le across the cross section,  Figure 13.13. Tensile stresses develop at the surface as this material is stretched to  keep up with the faster moving center core. These stresses cause minor ruptures that  roughen the surface. If the velocity gradient becomes extreme, prominent marks  occur on the surface, giving it the appearance of a bamboo pole; hence, the name  bambooing  for this more severe defect.

#  Production of Sheet and Film  

Thermoplastic sheet and ﬁ  lm are produced by a number of processes, most  important of which are two methods based on extrusion. The term  sheet  refers to  stock with a thickness ranging from  $0.5~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.020 in) to about  $12.5~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.5 in)  and used for products such as ﬂ  at window glazing and stock for thermoforming  (Section 13.9).  Film  refers to thicknesses below $0.5\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.020 in). Thin ﬁ  lms are  used for packaging (product wrapping material, grocery bags, and garbage bags);  thicker ﬁ  lm applications include covers and liners (pool covers and liners for  irrigation ditches).  

All of the processes covered in this section are continuous, high-production oper- ations. More than half of the ﬁ  lms produced today are polyethylene, mostly low- density PE. The principal other materials are polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, and  regenerated cellulose (cellophane). These are all thermoplastic polymers.  

Slit-Die Extrusion of Sheet and Film   Sheet and ﬁ  lm of various thicknesses are  produced by conventional extrusion, using a narrow slit as the die opening. The slit  may be up to $3\;\mathrm{m}$  (10 ft) wide and as narrow as around  $0.4~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.015 in). One pos- sible die conﬁ  guration is illustrated in Figure 13.14. The die includes a manifold that  spreads the polymer melt laterally before it ﬂ  ows through the slit (die oriﬁ  ce). One  of the difﬁ  culties in this extrusion method is uniformity of thickness throughout  the width of the stock. This is caused by the drastic shape change experienced by  

![](images/2f888a3a8718e92d35ec9f253bc89d07bbcc5f072c63f6ea0fba58a37b6f42da.jpg)

the polymer melt during its ﬂ  ow through the die and also to temperature and pres- sure variations in the die. Usually, the edges of the ﬁ  lm must be trimmed because of  thickening at the edges.  

To achieve high production rates, an efﬁ  cient method of cooling and collecting  the ﬁ  lm must be integrated with the extrusion process. This is usually done by imme- diately directing the extrudate into a quenching bath of water or onto chill rolls, as  shown in Figure 13.15. The chill roll method seems to be the more important com- mercially. Contact with the cold rolls quickly quenches and solidiﬁ  es the extrudate;  in effect, the extruder serves as a feeding device for the chill rolls that actually form  the ﬁ  lm. The process is noted for very high production speeds $-5\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$   $(1000\,\mathrm{ft/min})$ ).  In addition, close tolerances on ﬁ  lm thickness can be achieved. Owing to the cooling  method used in this process, it is known as  chill-roll extrusion .  

Blown-Film Extrusion Process   This is the other widely used process for making  thin polyethylene ﬁ  lm for packaging. It is a complex process, combining extrusion  and blowing to produce a tube of thin ﬁ  lm; it is best explained with reference to  the diagram in Figure 13.16. The process begins with the extrusion of a tube that is  immediately drawn upward while still molten and simultaneously expanded in size  by air inﬂ  ated into it through the die mandrel. A “frost line” marks the position  along the upward moving bubble where solidiﬁ  cation of the polymer occurs. Air  pressure in the bubble must be kept constant to maintain uniform ﬁ  lm thickness  and tube diameter. The air is contained in the tube by pinch rolls that squeeze the  tube back together after it has cooled. Guide rolls and collapsing rolls are also used  to restrain the blown tube and direct it into the pinch rolls. The ﬂ  at tube is then  collected onto a windup reel.  

The effect of air inﬂ  ation is to stretch the ﬁ  lm in both directions as it cools from  the molten state. This results in isotropic strength properties, which is an advantage  over other processes in which the material is stretched primarily in one direction.  Other advantages include the ease with which extrusion rate and air pressure can  be changed to control stock width and gage. Comparing this process with slit-die  extrusion, the blown-ﬁ  lm method produces stronger ﬁ  lm (so that a thinner ﬁ  lm can  be used to package a product), but thickness control and production rates are lower.

FIGURE 13.16  Blown- ﬁ  lm process for high  production of thin  tubular ﬁ  lm.  

The ﬁ  nal blown ﬁ  lm can be left in tubular form (e.g., for garbage bags), or it can be  subsequently cut at the edges to provide two parallel thin ﬁ  lms.  

Calendering   Calendering is a process for producing sheet and ﬁ  lm stock out of rub- ber (Section 14.5.3) or rubbery thermoplastics such as plasticized PVC. In the process,  the initial feedstock is passed through a series of rolls to work the material and reduce  its thickness to the desired gage. A typical setup is illustrated in Figure 13.17. The equip- ment is expensive, but production rate is high; speeds approaching $2.5\,\mathrm{m/s}$  (500 ft/min)  are possible. Close control is required over roll temperatures, pressures, and rotational  speed. The process is noted for its good surface ﬁ  nish and high gage accuracy in the  ﬁ  lm. Plastic products made by the calendering process include PVC ﬂ  oor covering,  shower curtains, vinyl table cloths, pool liners, and inﬂ  atable boats and toys.

#  Fiber and Filament Production (Spinning)  

The most important application of polymer ﬁ  bers and ﬁ  laments is in textiles. Their  use as reinforcing materials in plastics (composites) is a growing application, but still  small compared with textiles. A  ﬁ  ber  can be deﬁ  ned as a long, thin strand of material  whose length is at least 100 times its cross-sectional dimension. A  ﬁ  lament  is a ﬁ  ber  of continuous length.  

Fibers can be natural or synthetic. Synthetic ﬁ  bers constitute about  $75\%$  of the  total ﬁ  ber market today, polyester being the most important, followed by nylon,  acrylics, and rayon. Natural ﬁ  bers are about $25\%$  of the total produced, with cotton  by far the most important staple (wool production is signiﬁ  cantly less than cotton).  

The term  spinning  is a holdover from the methods used to draw and twist natural  ﬁ  bers into yarn or thread. In the production of synthetic ﬁ  bers, the term refers to the  process of extruding a polymer melt or solution through a  spinneret  (a die with mul- tiple small holes) to make ﬁ  laments that are then drawn and wound onto a  bobbin .  There are three principal variations in the spinning of synthetic ﬁ  bers, depending on  the polymer being processed: (1) melt spinning, (2) dry spinning, and (3) wet spinning.  

Melt spinning  is used when the starting polymer can best be processed by heat- ing to the molten state and pumping through the spinneret, much in the manner  of conventional extrusion. A typical spinneret is  $6\;\mathrm{mm}\;(0.25\;\mathrm{in})$  thick and contains  approximately 50 holes of diameter  $0.25\;\mathrm{mm}\;(0.010\;\mathrm{in})$ ; the holes are countersunk,  so that the resulting bore has an  $L/D$  ratio of only  $5/1$  or less. The ﬁ  laments that  emanate from the die are drawn and simultaneously air cooled before being col- lected together and spooled onto the bobbin, as shown in Figure 13.18. Signiﬁ  cant  

![](images/3367cec6c79d0a9397527a96287218746b1efb0cb9f4df748353cdf7c15ce5ee.jpg)  
FIGURE 13.18  Melt  spinning of continuous  ﬁ  laments.  

extension and thinning of the ﬁ  laments occur while the polymer is still molten, so  that the ﬁ  nal diameter wound onto the bobbin may be only $1/10$  of the extruded size.  Melt spinning is used for polyesters and nylons; because these are the most impor- tant synthetic ﬁ  bers, melt spinning is the most important of the three processes for  synthetic ﬁ  bers.  

In  dry spinning , the starting polymer is in solution and the solvent can be sep- arated by evaporation. The extrudate is pulled through a heated chamber that  removes the solvent; otherwise the sequence is similar to the previous. Fibers of  cellulose acetate and acrylic are produced by this process. In  wet spinning , the poly- mer is also in solution—only the solvent is nonvolatile. To separate the polymer, the  extrudate must be passed through a liquid chemical that coagulates or precipitates  the polymer into coherent strands that are then collected onto bobbins. This method  is used to produce rayon (regenerated cellulose ﬁ  bers).  

Filaments produced by any of the three processes are usually subjected to further  cold drawing to align the crystal structure along the direction of the ﬁ  lament axis.  Extensions of 2 to 8 are typical [13]. This has the effect of signiﬁ  cantly increasing the  tensile strength of the ﬁ  bers. Drawing is accomplished by pulling the thread between  two spools, where the winding spool is driven at a faster speed than the unwinding spool.  

Plastic (or rubber) coating involves application of a layer of the given polymer onto a  substrate material. Three categories are distinguished [6]: (1) wire and cable coating;  (2) planar coating, which involves the coating of a ﬂ  at ﬁ  lm; and (3) contour coating— the coating of a three-dimensional object. Wire and cable coating has already been  covered (Section 13.2.3); it is basically an extrusion process. The other two catego- ries are surveyed in the following paragraphs. In addition, there is the technology of  applying paints, varnishes, lacquers, and other similar coatings (Section 27.6).  

Planar coating  is used to coat fabrics, paper, cardboard, and metal foil; these  items are major products for some plastics. The important polymers include poly- ethylene and polypropylene, with lesser applications for nylon, PVC, and polyester.  In most cases, the coating is only 0.01 to  $0.05~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.0005–0.002 in) thick. The two  major planar coating techniques are illustrated in Figure 13.19. In the  roll method ,  

![](images/2889c25534dfc52c33f58e805fe99d8515e213a5a767a1b2a226dc51a989bc55.jpg)  
FIGURE 13.19  Planar coating processes: (a) roll method, and (b) doctor-blade method.  

the polymer coating material is squeezed against the substrate by means of opposing  rolls. In the  doctor blade method , a sharp knife edge controls the amount of polymer  melt that is coated onto the substrate. In both cases, the coating material is supplied  either by a slit-die extrusion process or by calendering.  

Contour coating  of three-dimensional objects can be accomplished by dipping or  spraying.  Dipping  involves submersion of the object into a suitable bath of polymer  melt or solution, followed by cooling or drying.  Spraying  (such as spray-painting) is  an alternative method for applying a polymer coating to a solid object.  

#  Injection Molding  

Injection molding is a process in which a polymer is heated to a highly plastic state  and forced to ﬂ  ow under high pressure into a mold cavity, where it solidiﬁ  es. The  molded part, called a  molding , is then removed from the cavity. The process pro- duces discrete components that are almost always net shape. The production cycle  time is typically in the range of 10 to 30 sec, although cycles of  $1\;\mathrm{{min}}$  or longer are  not uncommon for large parts. Also, the mold may contain more than one cavity,  so that multiple moldings are produced each cycle. A collection of plastic injection  moldings is displayed in Figure 13.20.  

Complex and intricate shapes are possible with injection molding. The challenge  in these cases is to fabricate a mold whose cavity is the same geometry as the part  and that also allows for part removal. Part size can range from about $50\;\mathrm{g}\;(2\;\mathrm{or})$  up  to about $25~\mathrm{kg}$  (more than $50\,\mathrm{lb}$ ), the upper limit represented by components such  as refrigerator doors and automobile bumpers. The mold determines the part shape  and size and is the special tooling in injection molding. For large, complex parts, the  mold can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. For small parts, the mold can be  built to contain multiple cavities, also making the mold expensive. Thus, injection  molding is economical only for large production quantities.

Injection molding is the most widely used molding process for thermoplastics.  Some thermosets and elastomers are injection molded, with modiﬁ  cations in equip- ment and operating parameters to allow for cross-linking of these materials. These  and other variations of injection molding are discussed in Section 13.6.5.  

# 13.6.1  PROCESS AND EQUIPMENT  

Equipment for injection molding evolved from metal die casting (Historical Note  13.1). A large injection molding machine is shown in Figure 13.21. As illustrated in  the schematic in Figure 13.22, an injection molding machine consists of two principal  components: (1) the plastic injection unit and (2) the mold clamping unit. The  injec- tion unit  is much like an extruder. It consists of a barrel that is fed from one end  by a hopper containing a supply of plastic pellets. Inside the barrel is a screw whose  operation surpasses that of an extruder screw in the following respect: in addition to  turning for mixing and heating the polymer, it also acts as a ram that rapidly moves  forward to inject molten plastic into the mold. A nonreturn valve mounted near the  tip of the screw prevents the melt from ﬂ  owing backward along the screw threads.  Later in the molding cycle the ram retracts to its former position. Because of its dual

FIGURE 13.22  Diagram of an injection molding machine, reciprocating screw type (some mechanical details are  simpliﬁ  ed).  

action, it is called a  reciprocating screw , a name that also identiﬁ  es the machine type.  Older injection molding machines used a simple ram (without screw ﬂ  ights), but the  superiority of the reciprocating screw design has led to its widespread adoption in  today’s molding plants. To summarize, the functions of the injection unit are to melt  and homogenize the polymer, and then inject it into the mold cavity.  

The  clamping unit  is concerned with the operation of the mold. Its functions are  to (1) hold the two halves of the mold in proper alignment with each other; (2) keep  the mold closed during injection by applying a clamping force sufﬁ  cient to resist  the injection force; and (3) open and close the mold at the appropriate times in the  molding cycle. The clamping unit consists of two platens, a ﬁ  xed platen and a mov- able platen, and a mechanism for translating the latter. The mechanism is basically a  power press that is operated by hydraulic piston or mechanical toggle devices of var- ious types. Clamping forces of several thousand tons are available on large machines.  

The cycle for injection molding of a thermoplastic polymer proceeds in the fol- lowing sequence, illustrated in Figure 13.23. The action begins with the mold open  and the machine ready to start a new molding: (1) The mold is closed and clamped.  (2) A  shot  of polymer melt, which has been brought to the right temperature and  viscosity by heating and the mechanical working of the screw, is injected under high  pressure into the mold cavity. The plastic cools and begins to solidify when it encoun- ters the cold surface of the mold. Ram pressure is maintained to pack additional  melt into the cavity to compensate for contraction during cooling. (3) The screw  is rotated and retracted with the nonreturn valve open to permit fresh polymer to  ﬂ  ow into the forward portion of the barrel. Meanwhile, the polymer in the mold has  completely solidiﬁ  ed. (4) The mold is opened, and the part is ejected and removed.

# 13.6.2  THE MOLD  

The mold is the special tool in injection molding; it is custom-designed and fabricated  for the given part to be produced. When the production run for that part is ﬁ  nished,  the mold is replaced with a new mold for the next part. This section examines several  types of mold for injection molding.  

Two-Plate Mold   The conventional  two-plate mold , illustrated in Figure 13.24,  consists of two halves fastened to the two platens of the molding machine’s clamp- ing unit. When the clamping unit is opened, the two mold halves open, as shown  in (b). The most obvious feature of the mold is the  cavity , which is usually formed  by removing metal from the mating surfaces of the two halves. Molds can contain  a single cavity or multiple cavities to produce more than one part in a single shot.  The ﬁ  gure shows a mold with two cavities. The  parting surfaces  (or  parting line  in a  cross-sectional view of the mold) are where the mold opens to remove the part(s).  

In addition to the cavity, other features of the mold serve indispensable functions  during the molding cycle. A mold must have a distribution channel through which  the polymer melt ﬂ  ows from the nozzle of the injection barrel into the mold cavity.  The distribution channel consists of (1) a  sprue , which leads from the nozzle into the  mold; (2)  runners , which lead from the sprue to the cavity (or cavities); and (3)  gates   that constrict the ﬂ  ow of plastic into the cavity. The constriction increases the shear  rate, thereby reducing the viscosity of the polymer melt. There are one or more gates  for each cavity in the mold.  

An  ejection system  is needed to eject the molded part from the cavity at the end  of the molding cycle.  Ejector pins  built into the moving half of the mold usually  accomplish this function. The cavity is divided between the two mold halves in such  a way that the natural shrinkage of the molding causes the part to stick to the mov- ing half. When the mold opens, the ejector pins push the part out of the mold cavity.  

A  cooling system  is required for the mold. This consists of an external pump con- nected to passageways in the mold, through which water is circulated to remove heat  from the hot plastic. Air must be evacuated from the mold cavity as the polymer rushes  in. Much of the air passes through the small ejector pin clearances in the mold. In addi- tion, narrow  air vents  are often machined into the parting surface; only about $0.03\,\mathrm{mm}$ (0.001 in) deep and 12 to  $25\,\mathrm{mm}$  (0.5–1.0 in) wide, these channels permit air to escape  to the outside but are too small for the viscous polymer melt to ﬂ  ow through.  

To summarize, a mold consists of (1) one or more cavities that determine part  geometry, (2) distribution channels through which the polymer melt ﬂ  ows to the  cavities, (3) an ejection system for part removal, (4) a cooling system, and (5) vents  to permit evacuation of air from the cavities.  

Other Mold Types   The two-plate mold is the most common mold in injection  molding. An alternative is a  three-plate mold , shown in Figure 13.25, for the same  part geometry as before. There are advantages to this mold design. First, the ﬂ  ow of  molten plastic is through a gate located at the base of the cup-shaped part, rather  than at the side. This allows more even distribution of melt into the sides of the  cup. In the side gate design in the two-plate mold of Figure 13.24, the plastic must  ﬂ  ow around the core and join on the opposite side, possibly creating a weakness at  the weld line. Second, the three-plate mold allows more automatic operation of the  molding machine. As the mold opens, it divides into three plates with two openings  between them. This action separates the runner from the parts, which drop by gravity  into containers beneath the mold.  

The sprue and runner in a conventional two- or three-plate mold represent waste  material. In many instances they can be ground and reused; however, in some cases  the product must be made of “virgin” plastic (plastic that has not been previously  molded). The  hot-runner mold  eliminates the solidiﬁ  cation of the sprue and runner  by locating heaters around the corresponding runner channels. Although the plastic  in the mold cavity solidiﬁ  es, the material in the sprue and runner channels remains  molten, ready to be injected into the cavity in the next cycle.

# 13.6.3  INJECTION MOLDING MACHINES  

Injection molding machines differ in both injection unit and clamping unit. This sec- tion discusses the important types of machines available today. The name of the  injection molding machine is generally based on the type of injection unit used.  

Injection Units   Two types of injection units are widely used today. The  recipro- cating-screw machine  (Section 13.6.1, Figures 13.21 and 13.22) is the most common.  This design uses the same barrel for melting and injection of plastic. The alternative  unit involves the use of separate barrels for plasticizing and injecting the polymer,  as shown in Figure 13.26(a). This type is called a  screw-preplasticizer machine  or  two-stage machine . Plastic pellets are fed from a hopper into the ﬁ  rst stage, which  uses a screw to drive the polymer forward and melt it. This barrel feeds a second bar- rel which uses a plunger to inject the melt into the mold. Older machines used one  plunger-driven barrel to melt and inject the plastic. These machines are referred to  as  plunger-type injection molding machines , Figure 13.26(b).  

Clamping Units   Clamping designs are of three types [11]: toggle, hydraulic,  and hydromechanical.  Toggle clamps  include various designs, one of which is  illustrated in Figure 13.27(a). An actuator moves the crosshead forward, extend- ing the toggle links to push the moving platen toward a closed position. At the  beginning of the movement, mechanical advantage is low and speed is high; but  near the end of the stroke, the reverse is true. Thus, toggle clamps provide both  high speed and high force at different points in the cycle when they are desirable.  They are actuated either by hydraulic cylinders or ball screws driven by electric  motors. Toggle-clamp units seem most suited to relatively low tonnage machines.  Hydraulic clamps , shown in Figure 13.27(b), are used on higher-tonnage injec- tion molding machines, typically in the range 1300 to  $8900~\mathrm{kN}$  (150 to 1000 tons).  These units are also more ﬂ  exible than toggle clamps in terms of setting the ton- nage at given positions during the stroke.  Hydromechanical clamps  are designed  for large tonnages, usually above  $8900~\mathrm{kN}$  (1000 tons). They operate by (1) using  hydraulic cylinders to rapidly move the mold toward closing position, (2) locking  the position by mechanical means, and (3) using high-pressure hydraulic cylinders  to ﬁ  nally close the mold and build tonnage.

# 13.6.4  SHRINKAGE AND DEFECTS IN INJECTION MOLDING  

Polymers have high thermal expansion coefﬁ  cients, and signiﬁ  cant shrinkage can  occur during cooling of the plastic in the mold. Contraction of crystalline plastics  tends to be greater than for amorphous polymers. Shrinkage is usually expressed  as the reduction in linear size that occurs during cooling to room temperature from  the molding temperature for the given polymer. Appropriate units are therefore  $\mathrm{mm/mm}$  (in/in) of the dimension under consideration. Typical values for selected  polymers are given in Table 13.1.  

Fillers in the plastic tend to reduce shrinkage. In commercial molding practice,  shrinkage values for the speciﬁ  c molding compound should be obtained from the  producer before making the mold. To compensate for shrinkage, the dimensions of  

TABLE  •  13.1  Typical values of shrinkage for moldings of selected thermoplastics.

Compiled from [14].  

the mold cavity must be made larger than the speciﬁ  ed part dimensions. The following  formula can be used [14]:  

$$
D_{c}=D_{p}+D_{p}S+D_{p}S^{2}
$$  

where $D_{c}=$  dimension of cavity, mm (in); $D_{p}=$  molded part dimension, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in), and  $S=$  shrinkage values obtained from Table 13.1. The third term on the right-hand side  corrects for shrinkage that occurs in the shrinkage.  

# Example 13.3  Shrinkage  in injection  molding  

The nominal length of a part made of polyethylene is to be $80\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine  the corresponding dimension of the mold cavity that will compensate for  shrinkage.  

Solution:  From Table 13.1, the shrinkage for polyethylene is $S=0.025$ . Using  Equation (13.19), the mold cavity diameter should be  

$\begin{array}{c}{{D_{c}=80.0+80.0(0.025)+80.0(0.025)^{2}}}\\ {{\mathrm{~}}}\\ {{=80.0+2.0+0.05=\bf{82.05\;mm}}}\end{array}$  

Because of differences in shrinkage among plastics, mold dimensions must be  determined for the particular polymer to be molded. The same mold will produce  different part sizes for different polymer types.  

Values in Table 13.1 represent a gross simpliﬁ  cation of the shrinkage issue. In  reality, shrinkage is affected by a number of factors, any of which can alter the  amount of contraction experienced by a given polymer. The most important fac- tors are injection pressure, compaction time, molding temperature, and part thick- ness. As injection pressure is increased, forcing more material into the mold cavity,  shrinkage is reduced. Increasing compaction time has a similar effect, assuming  the polymer in the gate does not solidify and seal off the cavity; maintaining pres- sure forces more material into the cavity while shrinkage is taking place. Net  shrinkage is thereby reduced.  

Molding temperature refers to the temperature of the polymer in the cylinder  immediately before injection. One might expect that a higher polymer temperature  would increase shrinkage, on the reasoning that the difference between molding and  room temperatures is greater. However, shrinkage is actually lower at higher mold- ing temperatures. The explanation is that higher temperatures signiﬁ  cantly lower the  viscosity of the polymer melt, allowing more material to be packed into the mold;  the effect is the same as higher injection pressures. Thus, the effect on viscosity more  than compensates for the larger temperature difference.  

Finally, thicker parts show greater shrinkage. A molding solidiﬁ  es from the out- side; the polymer in contact with the mold surface forms a skin that grows toward  the center of the part. At some point during solidiﬁ  cation, the gate solidiﬁ  es, isolating  the material in the cavity from the runner system and compaction pressure. When  this happens, the molten polymer inside the skin accounts for most of the remaining  shrinkage that occurs in the part. A thicker part section experiences greater shrinkage  because it contains more molten material.  

In addition to the shrinkage issue, other things can also go wrong. Here are some  of the common defects in injection molded parts:  

➢   Short shots . As in casting, a short shot is a molding that has solidiﬁ  ed before  completely ﬁ  lling the cavity. The defect can be corrected by increasing tempera- ture and/or pressure. The defect may also result from use of a machine with  insufﬁ  cient shot capacity, in which case a larger machine is needed.

 $\succcurlyeq$ Flashing . Flashing occurs when the polymer melt is squeezed into the parting  surface between mold plates; it can also occur around ejection pins. The defect  is usually caused by (1) vents and clearances in the mold that are too large;  (2) injection pressure too high compared with clamping force; (3) melt tempera- ture too high; or (4) excessive shot size.

 ➢   Sink marks and voids . These are defects usually related to thick molded sec- tions. A  sink mark  occurs when the outer surface on the molding solidiﬁ  es, but  contraction of the internal material causes the skin to be depressed below its  intended proﬁ  le. A  void  is caused by the same basic phenomenon; however,  the surface material retains its form and the shrinkage manifests itself as an  internal void because of high tensile stresses on the still-molten polymer. These  defects can be addressed by increasing the packing pressure after injection.  A better solution is to design the part to have uniform section thicknesses and  thinner sections.

 $\succcurlyeq$ Weld lines . Weld lines occur when polymer melt ﬂ  ows around a core or other  convex detail in the mold cavity and meets from opposite directions; the bound- ary thus formed is called a weld line, and it may have mechanical properties that  are inferior to those in the rest of the part. Higher melt temperatures, higher  injection pressures, alternative gating locations on the part, and better venting  are ways of dealing with this defect.  

# 13.6.5  OTHER INJECTION MOLDING PROCESSES  

The vast majority of injection molding applications involve thermoplastics. Several  variants of the process are described in this section.  

Thermoplastic Foam Injection Molding   Plastic foams have a variety of applica- tions, and these materials and their processing are discussed in Section 13.11. One of  the processes, sometimes called  structural foam molding , is appropriate to discuss  here because it is injection molding. It involves the molding of thermoplastic parts  that possess a dense outer skin surrounding a lightweight foam center. Such parts  have high stiffness-to-weight ratios suitable for structural applications.  

A structural foam part can be produced either by introducing a gas into the mol- ten plastic in the injection unit or by mixing a gas-producing ingredient with the  starting pellets. During injection, an insufﬁ  cient amount of melt is forced into the  mold cavity, where it expands (foams) to ﬁ  ll the mold. The foam cells in contact  with the cold mold surface collapse to form a dense skin, while the material in the  core retains its cellular structure. Items made of structural foam include electronic  cases, business machine housings, furniture components, and washing machine tanks.  Advantages cited for structural foam molding include lower injection pressures and  clamping forces, and thus the capability to produce large components, as suggested  by the preceding list. A disadvantage of the process is that the resulting part sur- faces tend to be rough, with occasional voids. If good surface ﬁ  nish is needed for the  application, then additional processing is required, such as sanding, painting, and  adhesion of a veneer.  

Multi-Injection Molding Processes   Unusual effects can be achieved by mul- tiple injection of different polymers to mold a part. The polymers are injected  either simultaneously or sequentially, and there may be more than one mold cavity  involved. Several processes fall under this heading, all characterized by two or more  injection units—thus, the equipment for these processes is expensive.  

Sandwich molding  involves injection of two separate polymers—one is the  outer skin of the part and the other is the inner core, which is typically a polymer  foam. A specially designed nozzle controls the ﬂ  ow sequence of the two polymers  into the mold. The sequence is designed so that the core polymer is completely sur- rounded by the skin material inside the mold cavity. The ﬁ  nal structure is similar  to that of a structural foam molding. However, the molding possesses a smooth  surface, thus overcoming one of the major shortcomings of the previous process. In  addition, it consists of two distinct plastics, each with its own characteristics suited  to the application.  

Another multi-injection molding process involves sequential injection of two  polymers into a two-position mold. With the mold in the ﬁ  rst position, the ﬁ  rst  polymer is injected into the cavity. Then the mold opens to the second position, and  the second melt is injected into the enlarged cavity. The resulting part consists of  two integrally connected plastics.  Bi-injection molding  is used to combine plastics  of two different colors (e.g., automobile tail light covers) or to achieve different  properties in different sections of the same part.  

Injection Molding of Thermosets   Injection molding is used for thermosetting  (TS) plastics, with certain modiﬁ  cations in equipment and operating procedure to  allow for cross-linking. The machines for thermoset injection molding are similar to  those used for thermoplastics. They use a reciprocating-screw injection unit, but the  barrel length is shorter to avoid premature curing and solidiﬁ  cation of the TS poly- mer. For the same reason, temperatures in the barrel are kept at relatively low levels,  usually $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to $125^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  ( $120^{\circ}\mathrm{F}{-}260^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ , depending on the polymer. The plastic, usually  in the form of pellets or granules, is fed into the barrel through a hopper. Plasticizing  occurs by the action of the rotating screw as the material is moved forward toward  the nozzle. When sufﬁ  cient melt has accumulated ahead of the screw, it is injected  into a mold that is heated to  $150^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to  $230^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(300^{\circ}\mathrm{F}{-}450^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ , where cross-linking  occurs to harden the plastic. The mold is then opened, and the part is ejected and  removed. Molding cycle times typically range from 20 sec to  $2~\mathrm{min}$ , depending on  polymer type and part size.  

Curing is the most time-consuming step in the cycle. In many cases, the part  can be removed from the mold before curing is completed, so that ﬁ  nal hardening  occurs because of retained heat within a minute or two after removal. An alterna- tive approach is to use a multiple-mold machine, in which two or more molds are  attached to an indexing head served by a single injection unit.  

The principal thermosets for injection molding are phenolics, unsaturated  polyesters, melamines, epoxies, and urea-formaldehyde. Elastomers are also  injected molded (Section 14.5.3). More than  $50\%$  of the phenolic moldings cur- rently produced in the United States are made by this process [11], representing  a shift away from compression and transfer molding, the traditional processes  used for thermosets (Section 13.7). Most of the TS molding materials contain  large proportions of ﬁ  llers (up to  $70\%$  by weight), including glass ﬁ  bers, clay,  wood ﬁ  bers, and carbon black. In effect, these are composite materials that are  being injected molded.  

Reaction Injection Molding   Reaction injection molding (RIM) involves the  mixing of two highly reactive liquid ingredients and immediately injecting the mix- ture into a mold cavity, where chemical reactions leading to solidiﬁ  cation occur.  The two ingredients form the components used in catalyst-activated or mixing- activated thermoset systems (Section 8.3.1). Urethanes, epoxies, and urea-formal- dehyde are examples of these systems. RIM was developed with polyurethane  to produce large automotive components such as bumpers, spoilers, and fenders.  These kinds of parts still constitute the major application of the process. RIM- molded polyurethane parts typically possess a foam internal structure surrounded  by a dense outer skin.  

As shown in Figure 13.28, liquid ingredients are pumped in precisely measured  amounts from separate holding tanks into a mixing head. The ingredients are rapidly  mixed and then injected into the mold cavity at relatively low pressure where polym- erization and curing occur. A typical cycle time is around $2\,\mathrm{{min}}$ . For relatively large  cavities the molds for RIM are much less costly than corresponding molds for con- ventional injection molding. This is because of the low clamping forces required in  RIM and the opportunity to use lightweight components in the molds. Other advan- tages of RIM include (1) low energy is required in the process; (2) equipment costs  are less than injection molding; (3) a variety of chemical systems are available that  enable speciﬁ  c properties to be obtained in the molded product; and (4) the produc- tion equipment is reliable, and the chemical systems and machine relationships are  well understood [17].

#  Compression and Transfer Molding  

Discussed in this section are two molding techniques widely used for thermosetting  polymers and elastomers. For thermoplastics, these techniques cannot match the  efﬁ  ciency of injection molding, except for very special applications.  

# 13.7.1  COMPRESSION MOLDING  

Compression molding is an old and widely used molding process for thermosetting  plastics. Its applications also include rubber tires and various polymer matrix com- posite parts. The process, illustrated in Figure 13.29 for a TS plastic, consists of (1)  loading a precise amount of molding compound, called the  charge , into the bottom  half of a heated mold; (2) bringing the mold halves together to compress the charge,  forcing it to ﬂ  ow and conform to the shape of the cavity; (3) heating the charge by  means of the hot mold to polymerize and cure the material into a solidiﬁ  ed part; and  (4) opening the mold halves and removing the part from the cavity.  

The initial charge of molding compound can be any of several forms, including  powders or pellets, liquid, or preform. The amount of polymer must be precisely  controlled to obtain repeatable consistency in the molded product. It has become  common practice to preheat the charge before placing it into the mold; this softens  the polymer and shortens the production cycle time. Preheating methods include  infrared heaters, convection heating in an oven, and use of a heated rotating screw  in a barrel. The latter technique (borrowed from injection molding) is also used to  meter the amount of the charge.  

Compression molding presses are oriented vertically and contain two platens  to which the mold halves are fastened. The presses involve either of two types of  actuation: (1) upstroke of the bottom platen or (2) downstroke of the top platen, the  former being the more common machine conﬁ  guration. They are generally powered  

![](images/5b51904451dcfabb2a1e1a09b024f0bd92d7023917f754bebf4988b614ba0fbc.jpg)

by a hydraulic cylinder that can be designed to provide clamping capacities up to  several hundred tons.  

Molds for compression molding are generally simpler than their injection mold  counterparts. There is no sprue and runner system in a compression mold, and  the process itself is generally limited to simpler part geometries because of the  lower ﬂ  ow capabilities of the starting thermosetting materials. However, provi- sion must be made for heating the mold, usually accomplished by electric resist- ance heating, steam, or hot oil circulation. Compression molds can be classiﬁ  ed  as  hand molds , used for trial runs;  semiautomatic , in which the press follows a  programmed cycle but the operator manually loads and unloads the press; and  automatic , which operate under a fully automatic press cycle (including automatic  loading and unloading).  

Materials for compression molding include phenolics, melamine, urea-formalde- hyde, epoxies, urethanes, and elastomers. Typical moldings include electric plugs and  sockets, pot handles, and dinnerware plates. Advantages of compression molding  in these applications include (1) molds that are simpler and less expensive, (2) less  scrap, and (3) low residual stresses in the molded parts. A typical disadvantage is  longer cycle times and therefore lower production rates than injection molding.  

# 13.7.2  TRANSFER MOLDING  

In this process, a thermosetting charge is loaded into a chamber immediately ahead  of the mold cavity, where it is heated; pressure is then applied to force the softened  polymer to ﬂ  ow into the heated mold where curing occurs. There are two variants  of the process, illustrated in Figure 13.30: (a)  pot transfer molding , in which the  charge is injected from a “pot” through a vertical sprue channel into the cavity; and  (b)  plunger transfer molding , in which the charge is injected by means of a plunger  from a heated well through lateral channels into the mold cavity. In both cases, scrap  is produced each cycle in the form of the leftover material in the base of the well and  lateral channels, called the  cull . In addition, the sprue in pot transfer is scrap mate- rial. Because the polymers are thermosetting, the scrap cannot be recovered.  

Transfer molding is closely related to compression molding, because it is used on  the same polymer types (thermosets and elastomers). One can also see similarities  to injection molding, in the way the charge is preheated in a separate chamber and  then injected into the mold. Transfer molding is capable of molding part shapes that  are more intricate than compression molding but not as intricate as injection mold- ing. Transfer molding also lends itself to molding with inserts, in which a metal or  ceramic insert is placed into the cavity before injection, and the heated plastic bonds  to the insert during molding.  

#  Blow Molding and Rotational Molding  

Both of these processes are used to make hollow, seamless parts out of thermo- plastic polymers. Rotational molding can also be used for thermosets. Parts range  in size from small plastic bottles of only  $5~\mathrm{mL}$   $_{(0.15\ \mathrm{oz})}$  to large storage drums  of 38,000-L (10,000-gal) capacity. Although the two processes compete in certain  cases, generally they have found their own niches. Blow molding is more suited to  the mass production of small disposable containers, whereas rotational molding  favors large, hollow shapes.

FIGURE 13.30  (a) Pot transfer molding, and (b) plunger transfer molding. Cycle in both processes is: (1) charge is  loaded into pot, (2) softened polymer is pressed into mold cavity and cured, and (3) part is ejected.  

# 13.8.1 BLOW MOLDING  

Blow molding is a molding process in which air pressure is used to inﬂ  ate soft plas- tic inside a mold cavity. It is an important industrial process for making one-piece  hollow plastic parts with thin walls, such as bottles and similar containers. Because  many of these items are used for consumer beverages for mass markets, production  is typically organized for very high quantities. The technology is borrowed from the  glass industry (Section 12.2.1) with which plastics compete in the disposable and  recyclable bottle market.  

Blow molding is accomplished in two steps: (1) fabrication of a starting tube of  molten plastic, called a  parison  (same as in glass-blowing); and (2) inﬂ  ation of the  

![](images/715928aa8fb1e2fac218ff93a8ba54f9c51528ef8323c47925d6aea9647302c8.jpg)

tube to the desired ﬁ  nal shape. Forming the parison is accomplished by either extru- sion or injection molding.  

Extrusion Blow Molding   This form of blow molding consists of the cycle illus- trated in Figure 13.31. In most cases, the process is organized as a very high pro- duction operation for making plastic bottles. The sequence is automated and often  integrated with downstream operations such as bottle ﬁ  lling and labeling.  

It is usually a requirement that the blown container be rigid, and rigidity depends  on wall thickness among other factors. The wall thickness of the blown container  can be related to the starting extruded parison [12], assuming a cylindrical shape for  the ﬁ  nal product. The effect of die swell on the parison is shown in Figure 13.32. The  mean diameter of the tube as it exits the die is determined by the mean die diameter  

![](images/e2f251c70e61842f0e9efd6c250dbefc76ef3c9c4066e40347c32df1a6116c5b.jpg)  
FIGURE 13.32  (1) Dimensions of  extrusion die, showing  parison after die swell;  and (2) ﬁ  nal blow-molded  container in extrusion  blow molding.  

$D_{d}$ . Die swell causes expansion to a mean parison diameter  $D_{p}$ . At the same time,  wall thickness swells from $t_{d}$  to $t_{p}$ . The swell ratio of the parison diameter and wall  thickness is given by  

$$
r_{s}=\frac{D_{p}}{D_{d}}=\frac{t_{p}}{t_{d}}
$$  

When the parison is inﬂ  ated to the blow mold diameter $D_{m}$ , there is a corresponding  reduction in wall thickness to  $t_{m}$ . Assuming constant volume of cross section,  

$$
{\pi}D_{p}t_{p}={\pi}D_{m}t_{m}
$$  

Solving for  $t_{m}$  

$$
t_{m}={\frac{D_{p}t_{p}}{D_{m}}}
$$  

Substituting Equation (13.20) into this equation,  

$$
t_{m}=\frac{r_{s}^{2}t_{d}D_{d}}{D_{m}}
$$  

The amount of die swell in the initial extrusion process can be measured by direct  observation; and the dimensions of the die are known. Thus, the wall thickness on  the blow-molded container can be determined.  

Injection Blow Molding   In this process, the starting parison is injection molded  rather than extruded. A simpliﬁ  ed sequence is outlined in Figure 13.33. Compared  to its extrusion-based competitor, injection blow molding usually has the following  advantages: (1) higher production rate, (2) greater accuracy in the ﬁ  nal dimensions,  (3) lower scrap rates, and (4) less wasteful of material. On the other hand, larger con- tainers can be produced with extrusion blow molding because the mold in injection  molding is so expensive for large parisons. Also, extrusion blow molding is techni- cally more feasible and economical for double-layer bottles used for storing certain

medicines, personal care products, and various chemical compounds.  Figure 13.34  shows an injection blow molded bottle and a parison for a similar part.  

In a variation of injection blow molding, called  stretch blow molding  (Figure 13.35),  the blowing rod extends downward into the injection molded parison during step 2,  thus stretching the soft plastic and creating a more favorable stressing of the polymer  than conventional injection blow molding or extrusion blow molding. The resulting  structure is more rigid, with higher transparency and better impact resistance. The  most widely used material for stretch blow molding is polyethylene terephthalate  (PET), a polyester that has very low permeability and is strengthened by the stretch- blow-molding process. The combination of properties makes it ideal as a container for  carbonated beverages (e.g., 2-L soda bottles).  

Materials and Products   Blow molding is limited to thermoplastics. Polyethylene  is the polymer most commonly used for blow molding—in particular, high density  and high molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE and HMWPE). In comparing their  properties with those of low density PE given the requirement for stiffness in the  ﬁ  nal product, it is more economical to use these more expensive materials because  the container walls can be made thinner. Other blow moldings are made of polypro- pylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyethylene terephthalate.  

Disposable containers for packaging liquid consumer goods constitute the major  share of products made by blow molding; but they are not the only products. Other

items include large shipping drums (55-gal) for liquids and powders, large storage  tanks (2000-gal), automotive gasoline tanks, toys, and hulls for sail boards and small  boats. In the latter case, two boat hulls are made in a single blow molding and subse- quently cut into two open hulls.  

# 13.8.2  ROTATIONAL MOLDING  

Rotational molding uses gravity inside a rotating mold to achieve a hollow form.  Also called  rotomolding , it is an alternative to blow molding for making large, hol- low shapes. It is used principally for thermoplastic polymers, but applications for  thermosets and elastomers are becoming more common. Rotomolding tends to  favor more complex external geometries, larger parts, and lower production quanti- ties than blow molding. The process consists of the following steps: (1) A predeter- mined amount of polymer powder is loaded into the cavity of a split mold. (2) The  mold is then heated and simultaneously rotated on two perpendicular axes, so that  the powder impinges on all internal surfaces of the mold, gradually forming a fused  layer of uniform thickness. (3) While still rotating, the mold is cooled so that the  plastic skin solidiﬁ  es. (4) The mold is opened, and the part is unloaded. Rotational  speeds used in the process are relatively slow. It is gravity, not centrifugal force, that  causes uniform coating of the mold surfaces.  

Molds in rotational molding are simple and inexpensive compared to injection  molding or blow molding, but the production cycle is much longer, lasting perhaps  $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$  or more. To balance these advantages and disadvantages in production, rota- tional molding is often performed on a multicavity indexing machine, such as the  three-station machine shown in Figure 13.36. The machine is designed so that three  molds are indexed in sequence through three workstations. Thus, all three molds  are working simultaneously. The ﬁ  rst workstation is an unload–load station in  which the ﬁ  nished part is unloaded from the mold, and the powder for the next part  is loaded into the cavity. The second station consists of a heating chamber where  hot-air convection heats the mold while it is simultaneously rotated. Temperatures  inside the chamber are around  $375^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(700^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ , depending on the polymer and the

item being molded. The third station cools the mold, using forced cold air or water  spray, to cool and solidify the plastic molding inside.  

A fascinating variety of articles are made by rotational molding. The list includes  hollow toys such as hobby horses and playing balls; boat and canoe hulls, sandboxes,  small swimming pools; buoys and other ﬂ  otation devices; truck body parts, automo- tive dashboards, fuel tanks; luggage pieces, furniture, garbage cans; fashion manne- quins; large industrial barrels, containers, and storage tanks; portable outhouses, and  septic tanks. The most popular molding material is polyethylene, especially HDPE.  Other plastics include polypropylene, ABS, and high-impact polystyrene.  

Thermoforming is a process in which a ﬂ  at thermoplastic sheet is heated and  deformed into the desired shape. The process is widely used to package consumer  products and fabricate large items such as bathtubs, contoured skylights, and inter- nal door liners for refrigerators.  

Thermoforming consists of two main steps: heating and forming. Heating is usu- ally accomplished by radiant electric heaters, located on one or both sides of the  starting plastic sheet at a distance of roughly $125\,\mathrm{mm}$  (5 in). Duration of the heating  cycle needed to sufﬁ  ciently soften the sheet depends on the polymer—its thickness  and color. Methods by which forming is accomplished can be classiﬁ  ed into three  basic categories: (1) vacuum thermoforming, (2) pressure thermoforming, and (3)  mechanical thermoforming. In the discussion of these methods, the forming of sheet  stock is described, but most thermoforming operations in the packaging industry are  performed on thin ﬁ  lms.  

Vacuum Thermoforming   This was the ﬁ  rst thermoforming process (simply  called  vacuum forming  when it was developed in the 1950s). Negative pressure  

![](images/3785f93640534e603864129ba378307dcdb6f5364b7a0da55a54217dd4cd2e05.jpg)  
FIGURE 13.37  Vacuum  thermoforming: (1) a ﬂ  at  plastic sheet is softened  by heating; (2) the  softened sheet is  placed over a  concave mold cavity;  (3) a vacuum draws the  sheet into the cavity;  and (4) the plastic  hardens on contact with  the cold mold surface,  and the part is removed  and subsequently  trimmed from the web.  

is used to draw a preheated sheet into a mold cavity. The process is explained in  Figure 13.37 in its most basic form. The holes for drawing the vacuum in the mold  are on the order of $0.8\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.031 in) in diameter, so their effect on the plastic sur- face is minor.  

Pressure Thermoforming   An alternative to vacuum forming involves positive  pressure to force the heated plastic into the mold cavity. This is called  pressure  thermoforming  or  blow forming ; its advantage over vacuum forming is that higher  pressures can be developed because the latter is limited to a theoretical maximum  of 1 atm. Blow-forming pressures of 3 to 4 atm are common. The process sequence  is similar to the previous, the difference being that the sheet is pressurized from  above into the mold cavity. Vent holes are provided in the mold to exhaust the  trapped air. The forming portion of the sequence (steps 2 and 3) is illustrated in  Figure 13.38.  

At this point it is useful to distinguish between negative and positive molds. The  molds shown in Figures 13.35 and 13.36 are  negative molds  because they have con- cave cavities. A  positive mold  has a convex shape. Both types are used in thermo- forming. In the case of the positive mold, the heated sheet is draped over the convex  form and negative or positive pressure is used to force the plastic against the mold  surface. A positive mold is shown in Figure 13.39 for vacuum thermoforming.  

The difference between positive and negative molds may seem unimportant,  because the part shapes are the same in the diagrams. However, if the part is drawn  

![](images/a69514f2cb9b346a5f7cb1340936cffb1f590f2c333802252c9f85cbc18a2ae4.jpg)  
FIGURE 13.38  Pressure thermoforming. The sequence is similar to the previous ﬁ  gure, the difference being:  (2) sheet is placed over a mold cavity; and (3) positive pressure forces the sheet into the cavity.  

into the negative mold, then its exterior surface will have the exact surface contour  of the mold cavity. The inside surface will be an approximation of the contour and  will possess a ﬁ  nish corresponding to that of the starting sheet. By contrast, if the  sheet is draped over a positive mold, then its interior surface will be identical to that  of the convex mold; and its outside surface will follow approximately. Depending on  the requirements of the product, this distinction might be important.  

Another difference is in the thinning of the plastic sheet, one of the problems in  thermoforming. Unless the contour of the mold is very shallow, there will be signiﬁ  - cant thinning of the sheet as it is stretched to conform to the mold contour. Positive  and negative molds produce a different pattern of thinning in a given part. Consider  the tub-shaped part in the ﬁ  gures. When the positive mold is used, as the sheet is  draped over the convex form, the portion making contact with the top surface (cor- responding to the base of the tub) solidiﬁ  es quickly and experiences virtually no  stretching. This results in a thick base but signiﬁ  cant thinning in the walls of the tub.  By contrast, a negative mold results in a more even distribution of stretching and  thinning in the sheet before contact is made with the cold surface.

FIGURE 13.39  Use  of a positive mold in  vacuum thermoforming:  (1) the heated plastic  sheet is positioned  above the convex mold  and (2) the clamp is  lowered into position,  draping the sheet  over the mold as a  vacuum forces the  sheet against the mold  surface.  

![](images/f47ffc2b917b98c875bbf00ceb0a2e5ca28ac42104c13a8a8f491589f2d0f40a.jpg)  
FIGURE 13.40  Prestretching the sheet  in (1) prior to draping  and vacuuming it over a  positive mold in (2).  

A way to improve the thinning distribution with a positive mold is to prestretch  the sheet before draping it over the convex form. As shown in Figure 13.40, the  heated plastic sheet is stretched uniformly by vacuum pressure into a spherical  shape before drawing it over the mold.  

The ﬁ  rst step depicted in frame (1) of Figure 13.40 can be used alone as a method  to produce globe-shaped parts such as skylight windows and transparent domes. In  the process, closely controlled air pressure is applied to inﬂ  ate the soft sheet. The  pressure is maintained until the blown shape has solidiﬁ  ed.  

Mechanical Thermoforming   The third method, called mechanical thermoform- ing, uses matching positive and negative molds that are brought together against the  heated plastic sheet, forcing it to assume their shape. In pure mechanical forming, air  pressure is not used at all. The process is illustrated in Figure 13.41. Its advantages  

![](images/a8662de5c546c568ad6596c66aae97aad37e989ff749e40f6837605478d0d0ae.jpg)

are better dimensional control and the opportunity for surface detailing on both  sides of the part. The disadvantage is that two mold halves are required; therefore,  the molds for the other two methods are less costly.  

Applications   Thermoforming is a secondary shaping process, the primary proc- ess being that which produces the sheet or ﬁ  lm (Section 13.3). Only thermoplas- tics can be thermoformed, because sheets of thermosetting or elastomeric polymers  have already been cross-linked during forming and cannot be softened by reheating.  Common thermoforming plastics are polystyrene, cellulose acetate and cellulose  acetate butyrate, ABS, PVC, acrylic (poly methyl meth a cry late), polyethylene, and  polypropylene.  

Mass production thermoforming operations are performed in the packaging  industry. The starting sheet or ﬁ  lm is rapidly fed through a heating chamber and then  mechanically formed into the desired shape. The operations are often designed to  produce multiple parts with each stroke of the press using molds with multiple cavi- ties. In some cases, the extrusion machine that produces the sheet or ﬁ  lm is located  directly upstream from the thermoforming process, thereby eliminating the need to  reheat the plastic. For best efﬁ  ciency, the ﬁ  lling process to put the consumable food  item into the container is placed immediately downstream from thermoforming.  

Thin ﬁ  lm packaging items that are mass produced by thermoforming include blis- ter packs and skin packs. They offer an attractive way to display certain commodity  products such as cosmetics, toiletries, small tools, and fasteners (nails, screws, etc.).  Thermoforming applications include large parts that can be produced from thicker  sheet stock. Examples include covers for business machines, boat hulls, shower  stalls, diffusers for lights, advertising displays and signs, bathtubs, and certain toys.  Contoured skylights and internal door liners for refrigerators are made, respectively,  out of acrylic (because of its transparency) and ABS (because of its ease in forming  and resistance to oils and fats found in refrigerators).  

In polymer shaping, casting involves pouring of a liquid resin into a mold, using  gravity to ﬁ  ll the cavity, and allowing the polymer to harden. Both thermoplastics  and thermosets are cast. Examples of the former include acrylics, polystyrene, polya- mides (nylons), and vinyls (PVC). Conversion of the liquid resin into a hardened  thermoplastic can be accomplished in several ways, which include (1) heating the  thermoplastic resin to a highly ﬂ  uid state so that it readily pours and ﬁ  lls the mold  cavity, and then permitting it to cool and solidify in the mold; (2) using a low-molecu- lar-weight prepolymer (or monomer) and polymerizing it in the mold to form a high- molecular-weight thermoplastic; and (3) pouring a plastisol (a liquid suspension of  ﬁ  ne particles of a thermoplastic resin such as PVC in a plasticizer) into a heated  mold so that it gels and solidiﬁ  es.  

Thermosetting polymers shaped by casting include polyurethane, unsaturated pol- yesters, phenolics, and epoxies. The process involves pouring the liquid ingredients  that form the thermoset into a mold so that polymerization and cross-linking occur.  Heat and/or catalysts may be required depending on the resin system. The reactions  must be sufﬁ  ciently slow to allow mold pouring to be completed. Fast-reacting ther- mosetting systems, such as certain polyurethane systems, require alternative shaping  processes like reaction injection molding (Section 13.6.5).  

Advantages of casting over alternative processes such as injection molding  include (1) the mold is simpler and less costly, (2) the cast item is relatively free of  residual stresses and viscoelastic memory, and (3) the process is suited to low pro- duction quantities. Focusing on advantage (2), acrylic sheets (Plexiglas, Lucite) are  generally cast between two pieces of highly polished plate glass. The casting process  permits a high degree of ﬂ  atness and desirable optical qualities to be achieved in the  clear plastic sheets. Such ﬂ  atness and clarity cannot be obtained by ﬂ  at sheet extru- sion. A disadvantage in some applications is signiﬁ  cant shrinkage of the cast part  during solidiﬁ  cation. For example, acrylic sheets undergo a volumetric contraction  of about $20\%$  when cast. This is much more than in injection molding in which high  pressures are used to pack the mold cavity to reduce shrinkage.  

Slush casting is an alternative to conventional casting, borrowed from metal  casting technology. In  slush casting , a liquid plastisol is poured into the cavity of a  heated split mold, so that a skin forms at the surface of the mold. After a duration  that depends on the desired thickness of the skin, the excess liquid is poured out of  the mold; the mold is then opened for part removal. The process is also referred to  as  shell casting  [6].  

An important application of casting in electronics is  encapsulation , in which  items such as transformers, coils, connectors, and other electrical components are  encased in plastic by casting.  

#  Polymer Foam Processing and Forming  

A polymer foam is a polymer-and-gas mixture, which gives the material a porous  or cellular structure. Other terms used for polymer foams include  cellular polymer ,  blown polymer , and  expanded polymer . The most common polymer foams are poly- styrene (Styrofoam) and polyurethane. Other polymers used to make foams include  natural rubber (“foamed rubber”) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).  

The characteristic properties of a foamed polymer include (1) low density, (2)  high strength per unit weight, (3) good thermal insulation, and (4) good energy  absorbing qualities. The elasticity of the base polymer determines the corresponding  property of the foam. Polymer foams can be classiﬁ  ed [6] as (1)  elastomeric , in which  the matrix polymer is a rubber, capable of large elastic deformation; (2)  ﬂ  exible , in  which the matrix is a highly plasticized polymer such as soft PVC; and (3)  rigid , in  which the polymer is a stiff thermoplastic such as polystyrene or a thermosetting  plastic such as a phenolic. Depending on chemical formulation and degree of cross- linking, polyurethanes can range over all three categories.  

The characteristic properties of polymer foams, and the ability to control their  elastic behavior through selection of the base polymer, make these materials highly  suitable for certain types of applications, including hot beverage cups, heat insulat- ing structural materials and cores for structural panels, packaging materials, cushion  materials for furniture and bedding, padding for automobile dashboards, and products  requiring buoyancy.  

Common gases used in polymer foams are air, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. The  proportion of gas can range up to $90\%$  or more. The gas is introduced into the poly- mer by several methods, called foaming processes. These include (1) mixing a liquid  resin with air by  mechanical agitation , then hardening the polymer by means of  heat or chemical reaction; (2) mixing a  physical blowing agent  with the polymer—a  gas such as nitrogen  $\left(\mathbf{N}_{2}\right)$  or pentane  $\left(\mathrm{C}_{5}\mathrm{H}_{12}\right)$ , which can be dissolved in the polymer

melt under pressure, so that the gas comes out of solution and expands when the  pressure is subsequently reduced; and (3) mixing the polymer with chemical com- pounds, called  chemical blowing agents , that decompose at elevated temperatures  to liberate gases such as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  or $\mathbf{N}_{2}$  within the melt.  

The way the gas is distributed throughout the polymer matrix distinguishes two  basic foam structures, illustrated in Figure 13.42: (a)  closed cell , in which the gas  pores are roughly spherical and completely separated from each other by the poly- mer matrix; and (b)  open cell , in which the pores are interconnected to some extent,  allowing passage of a ﬂ  uid through the foam. A closed cell structure makes a satisfac- tory life jacket; an open cell structure would become waterlogged. Other attributes  that characterize the structure include the relative proportions of polymer and gas  (already mentioned) and the cell density (number of cells per unit volume) which is  inversely related to the size of the individual air cells in the foam.  

There are many shaping processes for polymer foam products. Because the two  most important foams are polystyrene and polyurethane, this discussion is limited to  shaping processes for these two materials. Polystyrene is a thermoplastic and poly- urethane can be either a thermoset or an elastomer, so the processes covered here  for these two materials are representative of those used for other polymer foams.  

Polystyrene foams  are shaped by extrusion and molding. In  extrusion , a physi- cal or chemical blowing agent is fed into the polymer melt near the die end of the  extruder barrel; thus, the extrudate consists of the expanded polymer. Large sheets  and boards are made in this way and are subsequently cut to size for heat insulation  panels and sections.  

Several molding processes are available for polystyrene foam.  Structural foam  molding  and  sandwich molding  are discussed in Section 13.6.5. A more widely used  process is  expandable foam molding , in which the molding material usually con- sists of prefoamed polystyrene beads. The prefoamed beads are produced from pel- lets of solid polystyrene that have been impregnated with a physical blowing agent.  Prefoaming is performed in a large tank by applying steam heat to partially expand  the pellets, simultaneously agitating them to prevent fusion. Then, in the molding proc- ess, the prefoamed beads are fed into a mold cavity, where they are further expanded  and fused together to form the molded product. Hot beverage cups of polystyrene  foam are produced in this way. In some processes, the prefoaming step is omitted, and  the impregnated beads are fed directly into the mold cavity where they are heated,  expanded, and fused. In other operations, the expandable foam is ﬁ  rst formed into  a ﬂ  at sheet by the  blown-ﬁ  lm extrusion process  (Section 13.3) and then shaped by  thermoforming  (Section 13.9) into packaging containers such as egg cartons.  

Polyurethane foam  products are made in a one-step process in which the two  liquid ingredients (polyol and isocyanate) are mixed and immediately fed into a  

mold or other form, so that the polymer is synthesized and the part geometry is  created at the same time. Shaping processes for polyurethane foam can be divided  into two basic types [11]: spraying and pouring.  Spraying  involves use of a spray gun  into which the two ingredients are continuously fed, mixed, and then sprayed onto  a target surface. The reactions leading to polymerization and foaming occur after  application on the surface. This method is used to apply rigid insulating foams onto  construction panels, railway cars, and similar large items.  Pouring  involves dispens- ing the ingredients from a mixing head into an open or closed mold in which the  reactions occur. An open mold can be a container with the required contour (e.g., for  an automobile seat cushion) or a long channel that is slowly moved past the pouring  spout to make long, continuous sections of foam. The closed mold is a completely  enclosed cavity into which a certain amount of the mixture is dispensed. Expansion  of the reactants completely ﬁ  lls the cavity to shape the part. For fast-reacting poly- urethanes, the mixture must be rapidly injected into the mold cavity using  reaction  injection molding  (Section 13.6.5). The degree of cross-linking, controlled by the  starting ingredients, determines the relative stiffness of the resulting foam.  

#  Product Design Considerations  

Plastics are an important design material, but the designer must be aware of their  limitations. This section lists design guidelines for plastic components, beginning  with those that apply in general, and then ones applicable to extrusion and molding  (injection molding, compression molding, and transfer molding).  

Several general guidelines apply, irrespective of the shaping process. They are  mostly limitations of plastic materials that must be considered by the designer.  

$\gg$ Strength and stiffness . Plastics are not as strong or stiff as metals. They should  not be used in applications in which high stresses will be encountered. Creep  resistance is also a limitation. Strength properties vary signiﬁ  cantly among plas- tics, and strength-to-weight ratios for some plastics are competitive with metals  in certain applications.

 $\gg$ Impact resistance . The capacity of plastics to absorb impact is generally good;  plastics compare favorably with most metals.

 $\gg$ Service temperatures  of plastics are limited relative to engineering metals and  ceramics.

 $\gg$ Thermal expansion  is greater for plastics than for metals, so dimensional  changes resulting from temperature variations are much more signiﬁ  cant than  for metals.

 $\gg$   Many types of plastics are subject to degradation from sunlight and certain  other forms of radiation. Also, some plastics degrade in oxygen and ozone  atmospheres. Finally, plastics are soluble in many common solvents. On the posi- tive side, plastics are resistant to conventional corrosion mechanisms that afﬂ  ict  many metals. The weaknesses of speciﬁ  c plastics must be taken into account by  the designer.  

Extrusion is one of the most widely used plastic shaping processes. Several design  recommendations are presented here for conventional extrusion (compiled mostly  from [3]).  

➢   Wall thickness . Uniform wall thickness is desirable in an extruded cross section.  Variations in wall thickness result in nonuniform plastic ﬂ  ow and uneven cooling  that tend to warp the extrudate.

 $\succcurlyeq$ Hollow sections . Hollow sections complicate die design and plastic ﬂ  ow. It is  desirable to use extruded cross sections that are not hollow yet satisfy functional  requirements.

 $\succcurlyeq$ Corners . Sharp corners, inside and outside, should be avoided in the cross section,  because they result in uneven ﬂ  ow during processing and stress concentrations  in the ﬁ  nal product.  

The following guidelines apply to injection molding (the most popular molding  process), compression molding, and transfer molding (compiled from Bralla [3],  McCrum [10], and other sources).  

➢   Economic production quantities . Each molded part requires a unique mold,  and the mold for any of these processes can be costly, particularly for injec- tion molding. Minimum production quantities for injection molding are usually  around 10,000 pieces; for compression molding, minimum quantities are around  1000 parts, because of the simpler mold designs involved. Transfer molding lies  between the other two.

 $\succcurlyeq$   Part complexity . Although more complex part geometries mean more costly  molds, it may nevertheless be economical to design a complex molding if the  alternative involves many individual components assembled together. An  advantage of plastic molding is that it allows multiple functional features to be  combined into one part.

 ➢   Wall thickness . Thick cross sections are generally undesirable; they are waste- ful of material, more likely to cause warping caused by shrinkage, and take  longer to harden.  Reinforcing ribs  can be used in molded plastic parts to  achieve increased stiffness without excessive wall thickness. The ribs should  be made thinner than the walls they reinforce, to minimize sink marks on the  outside wall.

 ➢   Corner radii and ﬁ  llets . Sharp corners, both external and internal, are undesir- able in molded parts; they interrupt smooth ﬂ  ow of the melt, tend to create  surface defects, and cause stress concentrations in the ﬁ  nished part.

 $\succcurlyeq$ Holes . Holes are quite feasible in plastic moldings, but they complicate mold  design and part removal. They also cause interruptions in melt ﬂ  ow.

 $\succcurlyeq$ Draft . A molded part should be designed with a draft on its sides to facilitate  removal from the mold. This is especially important on the inside wall of a cup- shaped part because the molded plastic contracts against the positive mold  shape. The recommended draft for thermosets is around  $1/2^{\circ}$  to  $1^{\circ}$ ; for ther- moplastics it usually ranges between $1/8^{\circ}$  and $1/2^{\circ}$ . Suppliers of plastic molding  compounds provide recommended draft values for their products.

 ➢   Tolerances . Tolerances specify the allowable manufacturing variations for a  part. Although shrinkage is predictable under closely controlled conditions,  generous tolerances are desirable for injection moldings because of variations  in process parameters that affect shrinkage and diversity of part geometries  encountered. Table 13.2 lists typical tolerances for molded part dimensions of  selected plastics.

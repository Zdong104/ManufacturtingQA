The  material removal processes  are a family of shap- ing operations (Figure 1.5) in which excess material is  removed from a starting work part so that what remains  is the desired ﬁ  nal geometry. The “family tree” is shown  in Figure 20.1. The most important branch of the family  is  conventional machining , in which a sharp cutting tool  is used to mechanically cut the material to achieve the  desired geometry. The three most common machining  processes are turning, drilling, and milling. The “other  machining operations” in Figure 20.1 include shaping,  planing, broaching, and sawing. This chapter begins the  coverage of machining, which runs through Chapter 23.  

Another group of material removal processes is  the  abrasive processes , which mechanically remove  material by the action of hard, abrasive particles.  This process group, which includes grinding, is cov- ered in Chapter 24. The “other abrasive processes” in  Figure 20.1 include honing, lapping, and superﬁ  nish- ing. Finally, there are the  nontraditional processes ,  which use various energy forms other than a sharp  cutting tool or abrasive particles to remove material.  The energy forms include mechanical, electrochemical,  thermal, and chemical.  The nontraditional processes  are discussed in Chapter 25.  

Machining  is a manufacturing process in which a  sharp cutting tool is used to cut away material to leave

the desired part shape. The predominant cutting action in machining involves shear  deformation of the work material to form a chip; as the chip is removed, a new sur- face is exposed. Machining is most frequently applied to shape metals. The process is  illustrated in the diagram of Figure 20.2.  

Machining is one of the most important manufacturing processes. The Industrial  Revolution and the growth of the manufacturing-based economies of the world  can be traced largely to the development of the various machining operations

(Historical Note 21.1). Machining is important commercially and technologically  for several reasons:  

➢   Variety of work materials . Machining can be applied to a wide variety of work  materials. Virtually all solid metals can be machined. Plastics and plastic com- posites can also be cut by machining. Ceramics pose difﬁ  culties because of their  high hardness and brittleness; however, most ceramics can be successfully cut by  the abrasive machining processes discussed in Chapter 24.

 ➢   Variety of part shapes and geometric features . Machining can be used to create  any regular geometries, such as ﬂ  at planes, round holes, and cylinders. By introduc- ing variations in tool shapes and tool paths, irregular geometries can be created,  such as screw threads and T-slots. By combining several machining operations in  sequence, shapes of almost unlimited complexity and variety can be produced.

 $\succcurlyeq$ Dimensional accuracy . Machining can produce dimensions to very close  tolerances. Some machining processes can achieve tolerances of  $^{\pm}0.025~\mathrm{mm}$   $(\pm0.001\$  in), much more accurate than most other processes.

 $\succcurlyeq$ Good surface ﬁ  nishes . Machining is capable of creating very smooth surface  ﬁ  nishes. Roughness values less than 0.4 microns  $(16~\mu\mathrm{in})$  can be achieved in  conventional machining operations. Some abrasive processes can achieve even  better ﬁ  nishes.  

On the other hand, certain disadvantages are associated with machining and  other material removal processes:  

➢   Wasteful of material . Machining is inherently wasteful of material. The chips  generated in a machining operation are wasted material. Although these chips  can usually be recycled, they represent waste in terms of the unit operation.

 $\succcurlyeq$ Time consuming . A machining operation generally takes more time to shape a  given part than alternative shaping processes such as casting or forging.  

Machining is generally performed after other manufacturing processes such as  casting or bulk deformation (e.g., forging, bar drawing). The other processes create  the general shape of the starting work part, and machining provides the ﬁ  nal geom- etry, dimensions, and ﬁ  nish.  

#  Overview of Machining Technology  

Machining is not just one process; it is a group of processes. The common feature  is the use of a cutting tool to form a chip that is removed from the work part. To  perform the operation, relative motion is required between the tool and work. This  relative motion is achieved in most machining operations by means of a primary  motion, called the  cutting   speed , and a secondary motion, called the  feed . The shape  of the tool and its penetration into the work surface, combined with these motions,  produces the desired geometry of the resulting work surface.  

Types of Machining Operations  There are many kinds of machining operations,  each of which is capable of generating a certain part geometry and surface texture.  These operations are discussed in considerable detail in Chapter 21, but for now it  is appropriate to identify and deﬁ  ne the three most common types: turning, drilling,  and milling, illustrated in Figure 20.3.  

![](images/ff59d0a26e60a44ef42dd57a6261f16dc42ab653b7b650b477e8579bd7b14d40.jpg)  
FIGURE 20.3  The  three most common  types of machining  processes: (a) turning,  (b) drilling, and two  forms of milling: (c)  peripheral milling, and  (d) face milling.  

In  turning , a cutting tool with a single cutting edge is used to remove material  from a rotating workpiece to generate a cylindrical shape, as in Figure 20.3(a). The  speed motion in turning is provided by the rotating work part, and the feed motion  is achieved by the cutting tool moving slowly in a direction parallel to the axis  of rotation of the workpiece.  Drilling  is used to create a round hole. It is accom- plished by a rotating tool that typically has two cutting edges. The tool is fed in a  direction parallel to its axis of rotation into the work part to form the round hole,  as in Figure 20.3(b). In  milling , a rotating tool with multiple cutting edges is fed  slowly across the work material to generate a plane or straight surface. The direc- tion of the feed motion is perpendicular to the tool’s axis of rotation. The speed  motion is provided by the rotating milling cutter. The two basic forms of milling are  peripheral milling and face milling, as in Figure 20.3(c) and (d).  

Other conventional machining operations include shaping, planing, broaching,  and sawing (Section 21.6). Also, grinding and similar abrasive operations are often  included within the category of machining. These processes commonly follow the  conventional machining operations and are used to achieve a superior surface ﬁ  nish  on the work part.  

The Cutting Tool  A cutting tool has one or more sharp cutting edges and is made  of a material that is harder than the work material. The cutting edge serves to sepa- rate a chip from the parent work material, as in Figure 20.2. Connected to the cutting  edge are two surfaces of the tool: the rake face and the ﬂ  ank. The rake face, which  directs the ﬂ  ow of the newly formed chip, is oriented at a certain angle called the  rake angle $\alpha$ . It is measured relative to a plane perpendicular to the work surface.  

![](images/abf830fe3388cca4c02307279051427043d18b1d4893fae3f09df422fa454bd3.jpg)  
FIGURE 20.4  (a) A single-point tool showing rake face, ﬂ  ank, and tool point; and (b) a helical milling cutter,  representative of tools with multiple cutting edges.  

The rake angle can be positive, as in Figure 20.2(a), or negative as in (b). The ﬂ  ank  of the tool provides a clearance between the tool and the newly generated work  surface, thus protecting the surface from abrasion, which would degrade the ﬁ  nish.  This ﬂ  ank surface is oriented at an angle called the  relief angle .  

Most cutting tools in practice have more complex geometries than those in  Figure 20.2. There are two basic types, examples of which are illustrated in  Figure 20.4: (a) single-point tools and (b) multiple-cutting-edge tools. A  single-point  tool  has one cutting edge and is used for operations such as turning. In addition to the  tool features shown in Figure 20.2, there is one tool point from which the name of this  cutting tool is derived. During machining, the point of the tool penetrates below the  original work surface of the part. The point is usually rounded to a certain radius, called  the nose radius.  Multiple-cutting-edge tools  have more than one cutting edge and usu- ally achieve their motion relative to the work part by rotating. Drilling and milling use  rotating multiple-cutting-edge tools. Figure 20.4(b) shows a helical milling cutter used  in peripheral milling. Although the shape is quite different from a single-point tool,  many elements of tool geometry are similar. Single-point and multiple-cutting-edge  tools and the materials used in them are discussed in more detail in Chapter 22.  

Cutting Conditions  Relative motion is required between the tool and work to  perform a machining operation. The primary motion is accomplished at a certain  cutting speed   $\nu$ . In addition, the tool must be moved laterally across the work. This  is a much slower motion, called the  feed $f.$  The remaining dimension of the cut is the  penetration of the cutting tool below the original work surface, called the  depth of  cut   $d$ . Collectively, speed, feed, and depth of cut are called the  cutting conditions .  They form the three dimensions of the machining process, and for certain operations  (e.g., most single-point tool operations) they can be used to calculate the material  removal rate for the process:  

$$
R_{M R}=\nu f d
$$  

where $R_{M R}=$  material removal rate, $\mathrm{mm}^{3}/\mathrm{s}$   $(\mathrm{in}^{3}/\mathrm{min})$ ); $\nu=$  cutting speed,  $\mathrm{m/s}$  (ft/min),  which must be converted to  $\mathrm{mm/s}$   $(\mathrm{in}/\mathrm{min}$ ); $f\,{=}\,$  feed, mm (in); and  $d=$  depth of cut,  $\mathrm{mm}$  (in).  

![](images/5d1d69fa2ce696e7eb4d7c6cc5e4e2f0db8cd8d16677cd2df76a4e363839f646.jpg)  
FIGURE 20.5  Cutting speed,  feed, and depth of cut for a  turning operation.  

The cutting conditions for a turning operation are depicted in Figure 20.5. Typical  units used for cutting speed are $\mathrm{m/s}$  (ft/min). Feed in turning is expressed in $\mathrm{mm/rev}$   (in/rev), and depth of cut is expressed in mm (in). In other machining operations,  interpretations of the cutting conditions may differ. For example, in a drilling opera- tion, depth is interpreted as the depth of the drilled hole.  

Machining operations usually divide into two categories, distinguished by pur- pose and cutting conditions: roughing cuts and ﬁ  nishing cuts.  Roughing  cuts are  used to remove large amounts of material from the starting work part as rapidly  as possible, in order to produce a shape close to the desired form, but leaving some  material on the piece for a subsequent ﬁ  nishing operation.  Finishing  cuts are used  to complete the part and achieve the ﬁ  nal dimensions, tolerances, and surface ﬁ  nish.  In production machining jobs, one or more roughing cuts are usually performed on  the work, followed by one or two ﬁ  nishing cuts. Roughing operations are performed  at high feeds and depths—feeds of $0.4{-}1.25\:\mathrm{mm/rev}$   $(0.015{-}0.050\ \mathrm{in}/\mathrm{rev})$  and depths  of  $2.5{-}20~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.100–0.750 in) are typical. Finishing operations are carried out at  low feeds and depths—feeds of  $0.125{-}0.4~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.005–0.015 in/rev) and depths of  $0.75{-}2.0\:\mathrm{mm}$  (0.030–0.075 in) are typical. Cutting speeds are lower in roughing than  in ﬁ  nishing.  

A  cutting ﬂ  uid  is often applied to the machining operation to cool and lubricate  the cutting tool. Cutting ﬂ  uids are discussed in Section 22.4. Determining whether  a cutting ﬂ  uid should be used, and, if so, choosing the proper cutting ﬂ  uid, is usually  included within the scope of cutting conditions. Given the work material and tooling,  the selection of these conditions is very inﬂ  uential in determining the success of a  machining operation.  

Machine Tools  A machine tool is used to hold the work part, position the tool  relative to the work, and provide power for the machining process at the speed,  feed, and depth that have been set. By controlling the tool, work, and cutting condi- tions, machine tools permit parts to be made with great accuracy and repeatability,  to tolerances of  $0.025~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.001 in) and better. The term  machine tool  applies to  any power-driven machine that performs a machining operation, including grinding.  The term is also applied to machines that perform metal forming and pressworking  operations (Chapters 18 and 19).  

The traditional machine tools used to perform turning, drilling, and milling are  lathes, drill presses, and milling machines, respectively. Conventional machine tools  are usually tended by a human operator, who loads and unloads the work parts,  changes cutting tools, and sets the cutting conditions. Many modern machine tools  are designed to accomplish their operations with a form of automation called com- puter numerical control (Section 37.3).  

#  Theory of Chip Formation in Metal Machining  

The geometry of most practical machining operations is somewhat complex.  A simpliﬁ  ed model of machining is available that neglects many of the geometric  complexities, yet describes the mechanics of the process quite well. It is called the  orthogonal  cutting model, Figure 20.6. Although an actual machining process is  three-dimensional, the orthogonal model has only two dimensions that play active  roles in the analysis.  

# 20.2.1  THE ORTHOGONAL CUTTING MODEL  

By deﬁ  nition, orthogonal cutting uses a wedge-shaped tool in which the cutting edge  is perpendicular to the direction of cutting speed. As the tool is forced into the mate- rial, the chip is formed by shear deformation along a plane called the  shear plane ,  which is oriented at an angle $\phi$  with the surface of the work. Only at the sharp cutting  edge of the tool does failure of the material occur, resulting in separation of the chip  from the parent material. Along the shear plane, where the bulk of the mechanical  energy is consumed in machining, the material is plastically deformed.  

The tool in orthogonal cutting has only two elements of geometry: (1) rake angle  and (2) clearance angle. As indicated previously, the rake angle  $\alpha$  determines the  direction that the chip ﬂ  ows as it is formed from the work part; and the clearance  angle provides a small clearance between the tool ﬂ  ank and the newly generated  work surface.  

During cutting, the cutting edge of the tool is positioned a certain distance below  the original work surface. This corresponds to the thickness of the chip prior to chip  

![](images/b36b039864f56147549cdca3a6ced7f1bdee452a64e4d1c3eddb1db651c0c767.jpg)  
FIGURE 20.6  Orthogonal cutting: (a) as a three-dimensional process, and (b) how it reduces to two dimensions in  the side view.  

formation, $t_{o}$ . As the chip is formed along the shear plane, its thickness increases to  $t_{c}$ .  The ratio of  $t_{o}$  to $t_{c}$  is called the  chip thickness ratio  (or simply the  chip ratio ) $r$  

$$
r=\frac{t_{\mathrm{o}}}{t_{\mathrm{c}}}
$$  

Since the chip thickness after cutting is always greater than the corresponding thick- ness before cutting, the chip ratio will always be less than 1.0.  

In addition to $t_{o}$ , the orthogonal cut has a width dimension  $w$ , as shown in Figure  20.6(a), even though this dimension does not contribute much to the analysis in  orthogonal cutting.  

The geometry of the orthogonal cutting model allows us to establish an important  relationship between the chip thickness ratio, the rake angle, and the shear plane  angle. Let  $l_{s}$  be the length of the shear plane. The following substitutions can be  made: $t_{o}=l_{s}\sin\phi$ , and $t_{c}=l_{s}\cos(\phi-\alpha)$ . Thus,  

$$
r=\frac{l_{s}\sin\phi}{l_{s}\cos\left(\phi-\alpha\right)}=\frac{\sin\phi}{\cos\left(\phi-\alpha\right)}
$$  

This can be rearranged to determine  $\phi$  as follows:  

$$
\tan\,\phi={\frac{r\cos\,\alpha}{1-r\sin\,\alpha}}
$$  

The shear strain that occurs along the shear plane can be estimated by examining  Figure 20.7. Part (a) shows shear deformation approximated by a series of parallel  

![](images/29f8de24169338d0122358f31a69d0dd328b9c0706c4e6528de60ea54872db05.jpg)  

plates sliding against one another to form the chip. Consistent with the deﬁ  nition  of shear strain (Section 3.1.4), each plate experiences the shear strain shown in  Figure 20.7(b). Referring to part (c), this can be expressed as  

$$
\gamma={\frac{A C}{B D}}={\frac{A D+D C}{B D}}
$$  

which can be reduced to the following deﬁ  nition of shear strain in metal cutting:  

$$
\gamma=\tan\left(\phi-\alpha\right)+\cot\phi
$$  

# Example 20.1  Orthogonal  cutting  

In a machining operation that approximates orthogonal cutting, the cutting  tool has a rake angle $=10^{\circ}$ . The chip thickness before the cut $t_{o}=0.50\;\mathrm{mm}$  and  the chip thickness after the cut $t_{c}=1.125\;\mathrm{mm}$ . Calculate the shear plane angle  and the shear strain in the operation.  

Solution :  The chip thickness ratio can be determined from Equation (20.2):  

$$
r=\frac{0.50}{1.125}=0.444
$$  

The shear plane angle is given by Equation (20.3):  

$$
\tan\varphi=\frac{0.444\cos10}{1-0.444\sin10}=0.4738
$$
 
$$
\phi=25.4^{\circ}
$$  

Finally, the shear strain is calculated from Equation (20.4):  

$$
\begin{array}{l l}{{\gamma=\tan\left(25.4-10\right)+\cot25.4}}\\ {{\gamma=0.275+2.111=\pm2.386}}\end{array}
$$  

# 20.2.2  ACTUAL CHIP FORMATION  

It should be noted that there are differences between the orthogonal model and  an actual machining process. First, the shear deformation process does not occur  along a plane, but within a zone. If shearing were to take place across a plane of  zero thickness, it would imply that the shearing action must occur instantaneously  as it passes through the plane, rather than over some ﬁ  nite (although brief) time  period. For the material to behave in a realistic way, the shear deformation must  occur within a thin shear zone. This more realistic model of the shear deformation  process in machining is illustrated in Figure 20.8. Metal-cutting experiments have  indicated that the thickness of the shear zone is only a few thousandths of an inch.  Since the shear zone is so thin, there is not a great loss of accuracy in most cases by  referring to it as a plane.  

Second, in addition to shear deformation that occurs in the shear zone, another  shearing action occurs in the chip after it has been formed. This additional shear is  referred to as secondary shear to distinguish it from primary shear. Secondary shear  results from friction between the chip and the tool as the chip slides along the rake  

![](images/064528c4454ce68e9fe70bbd50f9eb7bc7b95f21af0d34869567572ef4951bf9.jpg)

face of the tool. Its effect increases with increased friction between the tool and chip.  The primary and secondary shear zones can be seen in Figure 20.8.  

Third, formation of the chip depends on the type of material being machined and  the cutting conditions of the operation. Four basic types of chip can be distinguished,  illustrated in Figure 20.9:  

$\gg$ Discontinuous chip . When relatively brittle materials (e.g., cast irons) are  machined at low cutting speeds, the chips often form into separate segments  (sometimes the segments are loosely attached). This tends to impart an irregu- lar texture to the machined surface. High tool–chip friction and large feed and  depth of cut promote the formation of this chip type.  

$\gg$ Continuous chip . When ductile work materials are cut at high speeds and  relatively small feeds and depths, long continuous chips are formed. A good  surface ﬁ  nish typically results when this chip type is formed. A sharp cutting  edge on the tool and low tool–chip friction encourage the formation of con- tinuous chips. Long, continuous chips (as in turning) can cause problems with  regard to chip disposal and/or tangling about the tool. To solve these prob- lems, turning tools are often equipped with chip breakers (Section 22.3.1).  

![](images/9ddd2ea59ba1797aac291ef0d949a94ed190ad021fb58817cc41bd74ed90752c.jpg)  
FIGURE 20.9  Four types of chip formation in metal cutting: (a) discontinuous, (b) continuous, (c) continuous with  built-up edge, (d) serrated.  

➢   Continuous chip with built-up edge . When machining ductile materials at low- to-medium cutting speeds, friction between tool and chip tends to cause por- tions of the work material to adhere to the rake face of the tool near the cutting  edge. This formation is called a built-up edge (BUE). The formation of a BUE is  cyclical; it forms and grows, then becomes unstable and breaks off. Much of the  detached BUE is carried away with the chip, sometimes taking portions of the  tool rake face with it, which reduces the life of the cutting tool. Portions of the  detached BUE that are not carried off with the chip become imbedded in the  newly created work surface, causing the surface to become rough.  

The preceding chip types were ﬁ  rst classiﬁ  ed by Ernst in the late 1930s [13]. Since  then, the available metals used in machining, cutting tool materials, and cutting  speeds have all increased, and a fourth chip type has been identiﬁ  ed:  

➢   Serrated chips  (the term  shear-localized  is also used for this fourth chip type).  These chips are semi-continuous in the sense that they possess a saw-tooth  appearance that is produced by a cyclical chip formation of alternating high  shear strain followed by low shear strain. This fourth type of chip is most closely  associated with certain difﬁ  cult-to-machine metals such as titanium alloys,  nickel-base superalloys, and austenitic stainless steels when they are machined  at higher cutting speeds. However, the phenomenon is also found with more  common work metals (e.g., steels) when they are cut at high speeds [13].  

#  Force Relationships and the Merchant Equation  

Several forces can be deﬁ  ned relative to the orthogonal cutting model. Based on  these forces, shear stress, coefﬁ  cient of friction, and certain other relationships can  be deﬁ  ned.  

# 20.3.1  FORCES IN METAL CUTTING  

Consider the forces acting on the chip during orthogonal cutting in Figure 20.10(a).  The forces applied against the chip by the tool can be separated into two mutually  perpendicular components: friction force and normal force to friction. The  friction  force $F$  is the frictional force resisting the ﬂ  ow of the chip along the rake face of the  tool. The  normal force to friction $N$  is perpendicular to the friction force. These two  components can be used to deﬁ  ne the coefﬁ  cient of friction between the tool and  the chip:  

$$
\mu={\frac{F}{N}}
$$  

The friction force and its normal force can be added vectorially to form a resultant  force $R$ , which is oriented at an angle $\beta$ , called the friction angle. The friction angle  is related to the coefﬁ  cient of friction as  

$$
\mu=\tan\beta
$$  

![](images/12556984ca60fa45fa2fac0aa1718cd5a9645d984251c6f3899e1c48efe4909a.jpg)  
FIGURE 20.10  Forces in metal cutting: (a) forces acting on the chip in orthogonal cutting, and (b) forces acting on  the tool that can be measured.  

In addition to the tool forces acting on the chip, there are two force components  applied by the workpiece on the chip: shear force and normal force to shear. The  shear force $F_{s}$  is the force that causes shear deformation to occur in the shear plane,  and the  normal force to shear $F_{n}$  is perpendicular to the shear force. Using the shear  force, the shear stress that acts along the shear plane between the work and the chip  can be deﬁ  ned:  

$$
\tau=\frac{F_{s}}{A_{s}}
$$  

where $A_{s}=$  area of the shear plane. This shear plane area can be calculated as  

$$
A_{s}=\frac{t_{o}w}{\sin\!\phi}
$$  

The shear stress in Equation (20.7) represents the level of stress required to per- form the machining operation. Therefore, this stress is equal to the shear strength of  the work material  $(\tau=S)$ ) under the conditions at which cutting occurs.  

Vector addition of the two force components  $F_{s}$  and  $F_{n}$  yields the resultant force  $R^{\prime}$ . In order for the forces acting on the chip to balance, this resultant  $R^{\prime}$  must be  equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and collinear with the resultant  $R$ .  

None of the four force components  $F,N,F_{s}$ , and $F_{n}$  can be directly measured  in a machining operation, because the directions in which they are applied vary  with different tool geometries and cutting conditions. However, it is possible  for the cutting tool to be instrumented using a force measuring device called a  dynamometer, so that two additional force components acting against the tool  can be directly measured: cutting force and thrust force. The  cutting force   $F_{c}$  is  in the direction of cutting, the same direction as the cutting speed  $\nu$ , and the  thrust force   $F_{t}$  is perpendicular to the cutting force and is associated with the  chip thickness before the cut $t_{o}$ . The cutting force and thrust force are shown in  Figure 20.10(b) together with their resultant force  $R^{\prime\prime}$ . The respective directions  of these forces are known, so the force transducers in the dynamometer can be  aligned accordingly.  

Equations can be derived to relate the four force components that cannot be meas- ured to the two forces that can be measured. Using the force diagram in Figure 20.11,  the following trigonometric relationships can be derived:  

If cutting force and thrust force are known, these four equations can be used to  calculate estimates of shear force, friction force, and normal force to friction. Based  on these force estimates, shear stress and coefﬁ  cient of friction can be determined.  

Note that in the special case of orthogonal cutting when the rake angle  $\alpha\,=\,0$ ,  Equations (20.9) and (20.10) reduce to  $\boldsymbol{F}=\boldsymbol{F}_{\iota}$  and $N=F_{c}$ , respectively. Thus, in this  special case, friction force and its normal force could be directly measured by the  dynamometer.  

# Example 20.2  Shear stress in  machining  

Suppose in Example 20.1 that cutting force and thrust force are measured dur- ing an orthogonal cutting operation: $F_{c}=1559\,\mathrm{N}$  and $F_{t}=1271$  N. The width  of the orthogonal cutting operation $w=3.0\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Based on these data, deter- mine the shear strength of the work material.  

Solution:  From Example 20.1, rake angle $\alpha=10^{\circ}$ , and shear plane angle $\phi=$ $25.4^{\circ}$ . Shear force can be computed from Equation (20.11):  

$$
F_{s}=1559\cos25.4-1271\sin25.4=863\:\mathrm{N}
$$  

The shear plane area is given by Equation (20.8):  

$$
A_{s}={\frac{(0.5)(3.0)}{\sin25.4}}=3.497\:\mathrm{mm}^{2}
$$  

Thus the shear stress, which equals the shear strength of the work material, is  

$$
\tau=S={\frac{863}{3.497}}=247\;\mathrm{N}/\mathrm{mm}^{2}=247\;\mathrm{MPa}
$$  

This example demonstrates that cutting force and thrust force are related to the  shear strength of the work material. The relationships can be established in a more  direct way. Recalling from Equation (20.7) that the shear force  $F_{s}=S\,A_{s}$ , the force  diagram of Figure 20.11 can be used to derive the following equations:  

$$
F_{c}=\frac{S t_{o}w\mathrm{cos}(\beta-\alpha)}{\mathrm{sin}\,\phi\,\mathrm{cos}(\phi+\beta-\alpha)}=\frac{F_{s}\,\mathrm{cos}(\beta-\alpha)}{\mathrm{cos}(\phi+\beta-\alpha)}
$$  

and  

$$
F_{t}=\frac{S t_{o}w\mathrm{sin}(\beta-\alpha)}{\mathrm{sin}\,\phi\,\mathrm{cos}(\phi+\beta-\alpha)}=\frac{F_{s}\,\mathrm{sin}(\beta-\alpha)}{\mathrm{cos}(\phi+\beta-\alpha)}
$$

These equations allow one to estimate cutting force and thrust force in an orthogonal  cutting operation if the shear strength of the work material is known.  

# 20.3.2  THE MERCHANT EQUATION  

One of the important relationships in metal cutting was derived by Eugene Mer- chant [10]. Its derivation was based on the assumption of orthogonal cutting, but  its general validity extends to three-dimensional machining operations. Merchant  started with the deﬁ  nition of shear stress expressed in the form of the following rela- tionship derived by combining Equations (20.7), (20.8), and (20.11):  

$$
\tau=\frac{F_{c}\cos\phi-F_{t}\sin\phi}{\left(t_{o}\,w/\mathrm{sin}\,\phi\right)}
$$  

Merchant reasoned that, out of all the possible angles emanating from the cut- ting edge of the tool at which shear deformation could occur, there is one angle  $\phi$   that predominates. This is the angle at which shear stress is just equal to the shear  strength of the work material, and so shear deformation occurs at this angle. For all  other possible shear angles, the shear stress is less than the shear strength, so chip  formation cannot occur at these other angles. In effect, the work material will select a  shear plane angle that minimizes energy. This angle can be determined by taking the  derivative of the shear stress  $\tau$  in Equation (20.15) with respect to $\phi$  and setting the  derivative to zero. Solving for $\phi$ , the relationship named after Merchant is obtained:  

$$
\phi=45+\frac{\alpha}{2}-\frac{\beta}{2}
$$  

Among the assumptions in the Merchant equation is that shear strength of  the work material is a constant, unaffected by strain rate, temperature, and other  factors. Because this assumption is violated in practical machining operations,  Equation (20.16) must be considered an approximate relationship rather than an  accurate mathematical equation. Nevertheless, consider its application in the fol- lowing example.  

# Example 20.3  Estimating  friction angle  

Using the data and results from the previous examples, determine (a) the fric- tion angle and (b) the coefﬁ  cient of friction.  

Solution:  (a) From Example 20.1, $\alpha=10^{\circ}$ , and  $\phi=25.4^{\circ}$ . Rearranging Equa- tion (20.16), the friction angle can be estimated:  

$$
\beta=2\left(45\right)+10-2\left(25.4\right)=\mathbf{49.2^{\circ}}
$$  

(b) The coefﬁ  cient of friction is given by Equation (20.6):  

$$
\mu=\tan49.2={\bf1.16}
$$  

Lessons Based on the Merchant Equation  The real value of the Merchant equa- tion is that it deﬁ  nes the general relationship between rake angle, tool–chip friction,  and shear plane angle. The shear plane angle can be increased by (1) increasing the  rake angle and (2) decreasing the friction angle (and coefﬁ  cient of friction) between  the tool and the chip. Rake angle can be increased by proper tool design, and friction  angle can be reduced by using a lubricant cutting ﬂ  uid.  

The importance of increasing the shear plane angle can be seen in Figure 20.12.  If all other factors remain the same, a higher shear plane angle results in a smaller  shear plane area. Since the shear strength is applied across this area, the shear force  required to form the chip will decrease when the shear plane area is reduced. A  greater shear plane angle results in lower cutting energy, lower power requirements,  and lower cutting temperature. These are good reasons to try to make the shear  plane angle as large as possible during machining.  

Approximation of Turning by Orthogonal Cutting  The orthogonal model can  be used to approximate turning and certain other single-point machining operations  so long as the feed in these operations is small relative to depth of cut. Thus, most

FIGURE 20.12  Effect of shear plane angle $\phi$ : (a) higher $\phi$  with a resulting lower shear plane area; (b) smaller $\phi$  with  a corresponding larger shear plane area. Note that the rake angle is larger in (a), which tends to increase shear  angle according to the Merchant equation.

FIGURE 20.13  Approximation of turning by the orthogonal model: (a) turning; and (b) the corresponding orthogonal  cutting.  

of the cutting will take place in the direction of the feed, and cutting on the point  of the tool will be negligible. Figure 20.13 indicates the conversion from one cutting  situation to the other.  

The interpretation of cutting conditions is different in the two cases. The chip  thickness before the cut $t_{o}$  in orthogonal cutting corresponds to the feed $f$ in turning,  and the width of cut  $w$  in orthogonal cutting corresponds to the depth of cut  $d$  in  turning. In addition, the thrust force $F_{t}$  in the orthogonal model corresponds to the  feed force $F_{f}$  in turning. Cutting speed and cutting force have the same meanings in  the two cases. Table 20.1 summarizes the conversions.

#  Power and Energy Relationships in Machining  

A machining operation requires power. The cutting force in a production machin- ing operation might exceed  $1000\,\mathrm{~N~}$  (several hundred pounds), as suggested by  Example 20.2. Typical cutting speeds are several hundred  $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{min}$ . The product of  cutting force and speed gives the power (energy per unit time) required to perform  a machining operation:  

$$
P_{c}=F_{c}\nu
$$  

where $P_{c}=$  cutting power, $\mathrm{{N-m/s}}$  or W (ft- $\mathrm{{.}l b/m i n}$ ); $F_{c}=$  cutting force, $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and $\nu=$ cutting speed, $\mathrm{{m/s}\left(f t/m i n\right)}$ . In U.S. customary units, power is traditionally expressed  as horsepower by dividing ft-lb/min by 33,000. Hence,  

$$
H P_{c}=\frac{F_{c}\nu}{33\small{,}000}
$$  

where  $H P_{c}\,=$ cutting horsepower, hp. The gross power required to operate the  machine tool is greater than the power delivered to the cutting process because of  mechanical losses in the motor and drive train in the machine. These losses can be  accounted for by the mechanical efﬁ  ciency of the machine tool:  

$$
P_{g}={\frac{P_{c}}{E}}\qquad{\mathrm{or}}\qquad H P_{g}={\frac{H P_{c}}{E}}
$$  

where $P_{g}=$  gross power of the machine tool motor, $\mathrm{W};H P_{g}=$  gross horsepower; and  $E=$  mechanical efﬁ  ciency of the machine tool. Typical values of  $E$  for machine tools  are around  $90\%$ .  

It is often useful to convert power into power per unit volume rate of metal cut.  This is called the  unit power , $P_{u}$  (or  unit horsepower , $H P_{u,v}$ ), deﬁ  ned:  

$$
P_{u}={\frac{P_{c}}{R_{M R}}}\qquad{\mathrm{or}}\qquad H P_{u}={\frac{H P_{c}}{R_{M R}}}
$$  

where $R_{M R}=$  material removal rate, $\mathrm{mm}^{3}/\mathrm{s}$   $(\mathrm{in}^{3}/\mathrm{min})$ ). The material removal rate can  be calculated as the product of  $\nu t_{o}\mathbf{W}.$ . This is Equation (20.1) using the conversions  from Table 20.1. Unit power is also known as the  speciﬁ  c   energy   $U$ .  

$$
U=P_{u}=\frac{P_{c}}{R_{M R}}=\frac{F_{c}\nu}{\nu t_{o}w}=\frac{F_{c}}{t_{o}w}
$$  

The units for speciﬁ  c energy are typically  $\mathrm{{N}{\cdot}m/m m^{3}(i n{\cdot}l b/i n^{3})}$ . However, the last  expression in Equation (20.21) suggests that the units might be reduced to $\mathbf{N}/\mathbf{mm}^{2}$ $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ). It is more meaningful to retain the units as  $\mathbf{N}\mathbf{-}\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{mm}^{3}$  or $\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{mm}^{3}\,(\mathrm{in}{\cdot}\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{in}^{3})$ .  

# Example 20.4  Power  relationships  in machining  

Continuing with the previous examples, determine cutting power and speciﬁ  c  energy in the machining operation if the cutting speed $=100\:\mathrm{m/min}$ . Summa- rizing the data and results from previous examples, $t_{o}=0.50\;\mathrm{mm}$ ,  $w=3.0\:\mathrm{mm}$ ,  $F_{c}=1557\,\mathrm{N}.$ .  

Solution:  From Equation (20.18), power in the operation is  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{P_{c}=(1557\:\mathrm{N})(100\:\mathrm{m/min})=155{,}700\:\mathrm{N-m/min}=}\\ {155{,}700\:\mathrm{J/min}=2595\:\mathrm{J/s}=2595\:\mathrm{W}}\end{array}
$$  

Speciﬁ  c energy is calculated from Equation (20.21):  

$$
U={\frac{155,700}{100(10^{3})(3.0)(0.5)}}={\frac{155,700}{150,000}}=1.038\ {\mathrm{N}}{\cdot}{\mathrm{m}}/{\mathrm{mm}}^{3}
$$

Unit power and speciﬁ  c energy provide a useful measure of how much power  (or energy) is required to remove a unit volume of metal during machining. Using  this measure, different work materials can be compared in terms of their power and  energy requirements. Table 20.2 presents a listing of unit horsepower and speciﬁ  c  energy values for selected work materials.  

The values in Table 20.2 are based on two assumptions: (1) the cutting tool is  sharp, and (2) the chip thickness before the cut  $t_{o}\,=\,0.25~\mathrm{{mm}}$  (0.010 in). If these  assumptions are not met, some adjustments must be made. For worn tools, the power  required to perform the cut is greater, and this is reﬂ  ected in higher speciﬁ  c energy  and unit horsepower values. As an approximate guide, the values in the table should  be multiplied by a factor between 1.00 and 1.25 depending on the degree of dullness  of the tool. For sharp tools, the factor is 1.00. For tools in a ﬁ  nishing operation that  are nearly worn out, the factor is around 1.10, and for tools in a roughing operation  that are nearly worn out, the factor is 1.25.  

Chip thickness before the cut $t_{o}$  also affects the speciﬁ  c energy and unit horse- power values. As  $t_{o}$  is reduced, unit power requirements increase. This relation- ship is referred to as the  size effect . For example, grinding, in which the chips are  extremely small by comparison to most other machining operations, requires very  high speciﬁ  c energy values. The $U$  and $H P_{u}$  values in Table 20.2 can still be used to  estimate horsepower and energy for situations in which $t_{o}$  is not equal to $0.25\;\mathrm{mm}$   $(0.010\ \mathrm{in})$  by applying a correction factor to account for any difference in chip  thickness before the cut. Figure 20.14 provides values of this correction factor  as a function of  $t_{o}$ . The unit horsepower and speciﬁ  c energy values in Table 20.2  should be multiplied by the appropriate correction factor when  $t_{o}$  differs from  $0.25\;\mathrm{mm}\;(0.010\;\mathrm{in})$ .

In addition to tool sharpness and size effect, other factors also inﬂ  uence the val- ues of speciﬁ  c energy and unit horsepower for a given operation. These other factors  include rake angle, cutting speed, and cutting ﬂ  uid. As rake angle or cutting speed  are increased, or when cutting ﬂ  uid is added, the  $U$  and  $H P_{u}$  values are reduced  slightly.  

Table 20.3 presents a troubleshooting guide that summarizes the actions that can  be taken to mitigate problems in which the power requirements of the machining  operation exceed the capacity of the machine tool.  

Of the total energy consumed in machining, nearly all of it  $\left(\sim98\%\right)$  is converted into  heat. This heat can cause temperatures to be very high at the tool–chip interface— over $600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\left(1100^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\right)$  is not unusual. The remaining energy  $({\sim}2\%)$  is retained as elastic  energy in the chip.  

Cutting temperatures are important because high temperatures (1) reduce tool  life, (2) produce hot chips that pose safety hazards to the machine operator, and  (3) can cause inaccuracies in work part dimensions due to thermal expansion of the  work material. This section discusses the calculation and measurement of tempera- tures in machining.  

# 20.5.1 ANALYTICAL METHODS TO COMPUTE CUTTING TEMPERATURES  

There are several analytical methods to calculate estimates of cutting temperature.  References [3], [5], [9], and [15] present some of these approaches. The method by  Cook [5] was derived using experimental data for a variety of work materials to  establish parameter values for the resulting equation. The equation can be used to  predict the increase in temperature at the tool–chip interface during machining:  

$$
\Delta T=\frac{0.4U}{\rho C}\bigg(\frac{\nu t_{o}}{K}\bigg)^{0.333}
$$  

where  $\Delta T=$  mean temperature rise at the tool–chip interface,  $\mathbf{C}^{\circ}\ (\mathrm{F}^{\circ})$ ;  $U={\mathrm{spe-}}$ ciﬁ  c energy in the operation, $\mathbf{N}\mathbf{\cdot}\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{mm}^{3}$  or $\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{mm}^{3}$   $\scriptstyle({\mathrm{in}}-{\mathrm{lb}}/{\mathrm{in}}^{3})$ );  $\nu=$  cutting speed,  $\mathrm{m/s}$   (in/sec);  $t_{o}=$  chip thickness before the cut, m (in); $\rho C=$  volumetric speciﬁ  c heat  of the work material,  $\mathrm{J/mm^{3}–C}$  (in $\mathrm{-lb/in}^{3}\mathrm{-F}$ );  $K=$  thermal diffusivity of the work  material, $\mathrm{m}^{2}/\mathrm{s}$   $\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}/\mathrm{sec}\right)$ .  

# Example 20.5  Cutting  temperature  

For the speciﬁ  c energy obtained in Example 20.4, calculate the increase in  temperature above ambient temperature of  $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$ . Use the given data from the  previous examples in this chapter:  $\nu=100\;\mathrm{m/min},$ $t_{o}=0.50\;\mathrm{mm}.$ . In addition,  the volumetric speciﬁ  c heat for the work material $=3.0$   $(10^{-3})$ $\mathrm{J/mm^{3}–C}$ , and  thermal diffusivity $=50\,(10^{-6})\;\mathrm{m}^{2}/\mathrm{s}$  (or  $50\:\mathrm{mm}^{2}/\mathrm{s}$ ).  

Solution:  Cutting speed must be converted to $\mathrm{mm/s}$ :  $\nu=\left(100\:\mathrm{m/min}\right)$ $(10^{3}\,\mathrm{mm/m})/(60\,\mathrm{s/min})=1667\,\mathrm{mm/s}$ . Equation (20.22) can now be used to  compute the mean temperature rise:  

$$
\Delta T={\frac{0.4(1.038)}{3.0(10^{3})}}\circ\mathbf{C}{\left({\frac{1667(0.5)}{50}}\right)}^{0.333}=(138.4)(2.552)={\bf353^{\circ}C}
$$  

# 20.5.2 MEASUREMENT OF CUTTING TEMPERATURE  

Experimental methods have been developed to measure temperatures in machining.  The most frequently used measuring technique is the  tool–chip thermocouple . This  thermocouple consists of the tool and the chip as the two dissimilar metals forming  the thermocouple junction. By properly connecting electrical leads to the tool and  work part (which is connected to the chip), the voltage generated at the tool–chip  interface during cutting can be monitored using a recording potentiometer or other  appropriate data-collection device. The voltage output of the tool–chip thermocou- ple (measured in $\mathrm{mV}$ ) can be converted into the corresponding temperature value  by means of calibration equations for the particular tool–work combination.  

The tool–chip thermocouple has been utilized by researchers to investigate the  relationship between temperature and cutting conditions such as speed and feed.

FIGURE 20.15  Experimentally  measured cutting  temperatures   plotted  against speed for  three work   materials,  indicating general  agreement with  Equation (20.23).  Based on data in [9]) 3  

Trigger [14] determined the speed–temperature relationship to be of the following  general form:  

$$
T=K\,\nu^{m}
$$  

where  $T=$  measured tool–chip interface temperature and  $\nu\,=$ cutting speed. The  parameters $K$  and $m$  depend on cutting conditions (other than $\nu$ ) and work material.  Figure 20.15 plots temperature versus cutting speed for several work materials, with  equations of the form of Equation (20.23) determined for each material. A simi- lar relationship exists between cutting temperature and feed; however, the effect of  feed on temperature is not as strong as cutting speed. These empirical results tend to  support the general validity of the Cook equation: Equation (20.22).

This ﬁ  nal part of the book is concerned with  manufac- turing support systems , which are the procedures and  systems used by a company to solve the technical and  logistics problems encountered in planning the proc- esses, ordering materials, controlling production, and  ensuring that the company’s products meet required  quality speciﬁ  cations. The position of the manufactur- ing support systems in the overall operations of the  company is portrayed in Figure 39.1. Like the manu- facturing systems in the factory, the manufacturing sup- port systems include people. People make the systems  work. Unlike the manufacturing systems in the factory,  most of the support systems do not directly contact the  product during its processing and assembly. Instead,  they plan and control the activities in the factory to  ensure that the products are completed and delivered  to the customer on time, in the right quantities, and to  the highest quality standards.  

The quality control system is one of the manufac- turing support systems, but it also consists of facilities  located in the factory—inspection equipment used to  measure and gage the materials being processed and  products being assembled. The quality control system  is covered in Chapter 40. Many of the traditional meas- urement and gaging techniques used in inspection are  described in Chapter 5. Other manufacturing support

Production system  

systems include process planning, production planning and control, just-in-time,  and lean production, covered in the present chapter.  

Process planning  is a technical staff function that plans the sequence of manufac- turing processes for the economic production of high-quality products. Its purpose  is to engineer the transition from design speciﬁ  cation to physical product. Process  planning includes (a) deciding what processes and methods should be used and in  what sequence, (b) determining tooling requirements, (c) selecting production equip- ment and systems, and (d) estimating costs of production for the selected processes,  tooling, and equipment.  

Process planning is usually the principal function within the manufacturing engi- neering department, whose overall goal is to optimize the production operations in  a given organization. In addition to process planning, the scope of manufacturing  engineering usually includes other functions such as the following:  

➢   Problem solving and continuous improvement . Manufacturing engineering  provides staff support to the operating departments (parts fabrication and prod- uct assembly) to solve technical production problems. It should also be engaged  in continuous efforts to reduce production costs, increase productivity, and  improve product quality.

 $\gg$ Design for manu fact ur ability . In this function, which chronologically precedes  the other two, manufacturing engineers serve as manu fact ur ability advisors to  product designers. The objective is to develop product designs that not only  meet functional and performance requirements, but that also can be produced  at reasonable cost with minimum technical problems at highest possible quality  in the shortest possible time.  

Manufacturing engineering must be performed in any industrial organization  that is engaged in production. The manufacturing engineering department usually  reports to the manager of manufacturing in a company. In some companies the  department is known by other names, such as process engineering or production  engineering. Often included under manufacturing engineering are tool design, tool  fabrication, and various technical support groups.  

#  Process Planning  

Process planning involves determining the most appropriate manufacturing proc- esses and the sequence in which they should be performed to produce a given part  or product speciﬁ  ed by design engineering. If it is an assembled product, process  planning includes deciding the appropriate sequence of assembly steps. The proc- ess plan must be developed within the limitations imposed by available processing  equipment and productive capacity of the factory. Parts or subassemblies that can- not be made internally must be purchased from external suppliers. In some cases,  items that can be produced internally may be purchased from outside vendors for  economic or other reasons.  

# 39.1.1  TRADITIONAL PROCESS PLANNING  

Traditionally, process planning has been accomplished by manufacturing engineers  who are knowledgeable in the particular processes used in the factory and are able  to read engineering drawings. Based on their knowledge, skill, and experience, they  develop the processing steps in the most logical sequence required to make each  part. Table 39.1 lists the many details and decisions usually included within the scope  of process planning. Some of these details are often delegated to specialists, such as  tool designers; but manufacturing engineering is responsible for them.  

Process Planning for Parts  The processes needed to manufacture a given part  are determined largely by the material out of which it is to be made. The material is  selected by the product designer based on functional requirements. Once the mate- rial has been selected, the choice of possible processes is narrowed considerably.  

A typical processing sequence to fabricate a discrete part consists of (1) a basic  process, (2) one or more secondary processes, (3) operations to enhance physical  properties, and (4) ﬁ  nishing operations, as illustrated in Figure 39.2. Basic and sec- ondary processes are shaping processes that alter the geometry of a work part (Sec- tion 1.3.1). A  basic process  establishes the initial geometry of the part. Examples  

![](images/c7a8b774dd5c1ebc1e19a0c6a523acbf6a71c052a4239dbfee6af8e231203b2e.jpg)  

TABLE  •  39.1  Decisions and details required in process planning.  

Processes and sequence . The process plan should brieﬂ  y describe all processing steps used on the work unit  (e.g., part, assembly) in the order in which they are performed. Equipment selection . In general, manufacturing engineers try to develop process plans that utilize existing  equipment. When this is not possible, the component in question must be purchased (Section 39.1.2), or new  equipment must be installed in the plant. Tools ,  dies,   molds,   ﬁ  xtures,  and  gages . The process planner must decide what tooling is needed for each process.  Actual design is usually delegated to the tool design department, and fabrication is accomplished by the tool room. Cutting tools  and  cutting conditions  for machining operations. These are speciﬁ  ed by the process planner, industrial  engineer, shop foreman, or machine operator, often with reference to standard handbook recommendations. Methods . Methods include hand and body motions, workplace layout, small tools, hoists for lifting heavy parts, and  so forth. Methods must be speciﬁ  ed for manual operations (e.g., assembly) and manual portions of machine cycles  (e.g., loading and unloading a production machine). Methods planning is traditionally done by industrial engineers.  Work standards . Work measurement techniques are used to establish time standards for each operation. Estimating production costs . This is often accomplished by cost estimators with help from the process planner.

include metal casting, forging, and sheet-metal rolling. In most cases, the starting  geometry must be reﬁ  ned by a series of  secondary processes . These operations trans- form the basic shape into the ﬁ  nal geometry. There is a correlation between the sec- ondary processes that might be used and the basic process that provides the initial  form. For example, when a rolling mill produces strips or coils of sheet metal, the  secondary processes are stamping operations such as blanking, punching, and bend- ing. When casting or forging are the basic processes, machining operations are gener- ally the secondary processes. Figure 39.3 shows a plumbing ﬁ  xture, the production of  which consists of casting as the basic process followed by machining as the second- ary process. Selection of certain basic processes minimizes the need for secondary  processes. For example, if plastic injection molding is the basic process, secondary  operations are usually not required because molding is capable of providing the  detailed geometric features with good dimensional accuracy.  

Shaping operations are generally followed by operations to enhance physical  properties and/or ﬁ  nish the product.  Operations to enhance properties  include heat  treating operations on metal components and glassware. In many cases, parts do not

TABLE  •  39.2  Some typical process sequences.

require these property-enhancing steps in their processing sequence. This is indi- cated by the alternate arrow path in our ﬁ  gure.  Finishing operations  are the ﬁ  nal  operations in the sequence; they usually provide a coating on the work part (or  assembly) surface. Examples of these processes are electroplating and painting.  

In some cases, property-enhancing processes are followed by additional second- ary operations before proceeding to ﬁ  nishing, as suggested by the return loop in  Figure 39.2. An example is a machined part that is hardened by heat treatment.  Prior to heat treatment, the part is left slightly oversized to allow for distortion.  After hardening, it is reduced to ﬁ  nal size and tolerance by ﬁ  nish grinding. Another  example, again in metal parts fabrication, is when annealing is used to restore ductil- ity to the metal after cold working to permit further deformation of the workpiece.  

Table 39.2 presents some of the typical processing sequences for various materi- als and basic processes. The task of the process planner usually begins after the basic  process has provided the initial shape of the part. Machined parts begin as bar stock  or castings or forgings, and the basic processes for these starting shapes are often  external to the fabricating plant. Stampings begin as sheet metal coils or strips pur- chased from the mill. These are the raw materials supplied from external suppliers  for the secondary processes and subsequent operations to be performed in the fac- tory. Determining the most appropriate processes and the order in which they must  be accomplished relies on the skill, experience, and judgment of the process planner.  Some of the basic guidelines and considerations used by process planners to make  these decisions are outlined in Table 39.3.  

The Route Sheet  The process plan is prepared on a form called a  route sheet ,  a typical example of which is shown in Figure 39.4 (some companies use other  names for this form). It is called a route sheet because it speciﬁ  es the sequence of  operations and equipment that will be visited by the part during its production.  The route sheet is to the process planner what the engineering drawing is to the  product designer. It is the ofﬁ  cial document that speciﬁ  es the details of the process  plan. The route sheet should include all manufacturing operations to be performed  on the work part, listed in the proper order in which they are to be accomplished.  For each operation, the following should be listed: (1) a brief description of the  TABLE  •  39.3  Guidelines and considerations in deciding processes and their sequence in process planning.  

Design requirements . The sequence of processes must satisfy the dimensions, tolerances, surface ﬁ  nish, and other  speciﬁ  cations established by product design.  

Quality requirements . Processes must be selected that satisfy quality requirements in terms of tolerances, surface  integrity, consistency and repeatability, and other quality measures.  

Production volume  and  rate . Is the product in the category of low, medium, or high production? The selection of  processes and systems is strongly inﬂ  uenced by volume and production rate.  

Available processes . If the product and its components are to be made in-house, the process planner must select  processes and equipment already available in the factory.  

Material utilization . It is desirable for the process sequence to make efﬁ  cient use of materials and minimize waste.  When possible, net shape or near net shape processes should be selected.  

Precedence constraints . These are technological sequencing requirements that determine or restrict the order in  which the processing steps can be performed. A hole must be drilled before it can be tapped; a powder-metal part  must be pressed before sintering; a surface must be cleaned before painting; and so on.  

Reference surfaces . Certain surfaces of the part must be formed (usually by machining) near the beginning of the  sequence so they can serve as locating surfaces for other dimensions that are formed subsequently. For example, if a  hole is to be drilled a certain distance from the edge of a given part, that edge must ﬁ  rst be machined.  

Minimize setups . The number of separate machine setups should be minimized. Wherever possible, operations  should be combined at the same workstation. This saves time and reduces material handling.  

Eliminate unnecessary steps . The process sequence should be planned with the minimum number of processing  steps. Unnecessary operations should be avoided. Design changes should be requested to eliminate features not  absolutely needed, thereby eliminating the processing steps associated with those features.  

Flexibility . Where feasible, the process should be sufﬁ  ciently ﬂ  exible to accommodate engineering design changes.  This is often a problem when special tooling must be designed to produce the part; if the part design is changed, the  special tooling may be rendered obsolete.  

Safety . Worker safety must be considered in process selection. This makes good economic sense, and it is the law  (Occupational Safety and Health Act).  

Minimum cost . The process sequence should be the production method that satisﬁ  es all of the above requirements  and also achieves the lowest possible product cost  

operation indicating the work to be done, surfaces to be processed with references  to the part drawing, and dimensions (and tolerances, if not speciﬁ  ed on part draw- ing) to be achieved; (2) the equipment on which the work is to be performed; and  (3) any special tooling required, such as dies, molds, cutting tools, jigs or ﬁ  xtures,  and gages. In addition, some companies include cycle time standards, setup times,  and other data on the route sheet.  

Sometimes a more detailed  operation sheet  is also prepared for each operation  listed in the routing. This is retained in the particular department where the opera- tion is performed. It indicates the speciﬁ  c details of the operation, such as cutting  speeds, feeds, and tools, and other instructions useful to the machine operator. Setup  sketches are sometimes also included.  

Process Planning for Assemblies  For low production, assembly is generally done  at individual workstations and a worker or team of workers performs the assembly  work elements to complete the product. In medium and high production, assembly  is usually performed on production lines (Section 37.2). In either case, there is a  precedence order in which the work must be accomplished.  

Process planning for assembly involves preparation of the assembly instructions  that must be performed. For single stations, the documentation is similar to the  

![](images/c18702f9d77ea80168b1877c52137291a2d442ece7ccb3c6b610df11761f8ef6.jpg)  

processing route sheet in Figure 39.4. It contains a list of the assembly steps in the  order in which they must be done. For assembly line production, process planning  consists of allocating work elements to particular stations along the line, a procedure  called  line balancing  (Section 37.3). In effect, the assembly line routes the work  units to individual stations, and the line balancing solution determines what assem- bly steps must be performed at each station. As with process planning for parts, any  tools and ﬁ  xtures needed to accomplish a given assembly work element must be  decided, and the workplace layout must be designed.  

# 39.1.2  MAKE OR BUY DECISION  

Inevitably, the question arises as to whether a given part should be purchased from  an outside vendor or made internally. First of all, it should be recognized that virtu- ally all manufacturers purchase their starting materials from suppliers. A machine  shop buys bar stock from a metals distributor and castings from a foundry. A plastic  molder obtains molding compound from a chemical company. A pressworking com- pany purchases sheet metal from a rolling mill. Very few companies are vertically  integrated all the way from raw materials to ﬁ  nished product.  

Given that a company purchases at least some of its starting materials, it is rea- sonable to ask whether the company should purchase at least some of the parts that  would otherwise be made in its own factory. The answer to the question is the  make  or buy decision . The make versus buy question is probably appropriate to ask for  every component used by the company.  

Cost is the most important factor in deciding whether a part should be made in- house or purchased. If the vendor is signiﬁ  cantly more proﬁ  cient in the processes  required to make the component, it is likely that the internal production cost will be  greater than the purchase price even when a proﬁ  t is included for the vendor. On the  other hand, if purchasing the part results in idle equipment in the factory, then an  apparent cost advantage for the vendor may be a disadvantage for the home factory.  Consider the following example.  

# Example 39.1  Make or  buy cost  comparison  

Suppose that the quoted price for a certain component from a vendor is  $\S8.00$  per unit for 1000 units. The same part made in the home factory would  cost $\S9.00$ . The cost breakdown on the make alternative is as follows:  

Unit material cost $=\Uparrow2.25$  per unit Direct labor $=\S2.00$  per unit Labor overhead at $150\%=\S3.00$  per unit Equipment ﬁ  xed cost $\iota=\S1.75$  per unit Total  $={\overline{{\S9.00}}}$  per unit  

Should the component by bought or made in-house?  

Solution:  Although the vendor’s quote seems to favor the buy decision,  consider the possible effect on the factory if the quote is accepted. The equip- ment ﬁ  xed cost is an allocated cost based on an investment that has already  been made (Section 1.5.2). If it turns out that the equipment is rendered idle  by the decision to buy the part, then one might argue that the ﬁ  xed cost of  $\S1.75$  continues even if the equipment is not in use. Similarly, the overhead  cost of  $\S3.00$  consists of factory ﬂ  oor space, indirect labor, and other costs that  will also continue even if the part is bought. By this reasoning, the decision to  purchase might cost the company as much as  $\S8.00+\S1.75+\S3.00=\S12.75$   per unit if it results in idle time in the factory on the machine that would have  been used to make the part.  

On the other hand, if the equipment can be used to produce other  components for which the internal prices are less than the corresponding  external quotes, then a buy decision makes good economic sense.  

Make or buy decisions are rarely as clear as in Example 39.1. Some of the other  factors that enter the decision are listed in Table 39.4. Although these factors appear  to be subjective, they all have cost implications, either directly or indirectly. In recent  years, major companies have placed strong emphasis on building close relationships  with parts suppliers. This trend has been especially prevalent in the automobile  industry, where long-term agreements have been reached between each carmaker  and a limited number of vendors who are able to deliver high-quality components  reliably on schedule.  

# 39.1.3  COMPUTER-AIDED PROCESS PLANNING  

During the last several decades, there has been considerable interest automating the  process planning function by means of computer systems. Shop people knowledge- able in manufacturing processes are gradually retiring. An alternative approach to  process planning is needed, and computer-aided process planning (CAPP) systems  

TABLE  •  39.4  Key factors in the make or buy decision. 
![](images/87bfdaffada88f583f304ff81730f23943948bcbf9bd9dd6bb951d44161f18c1.jpg)  

provide this alternative. CAPP systems are designed around either of two approaches:  retrieval systems and generative systems.  

Retrieval CAPP Systems  Retrieval CAPP systems, also known as  variant CAPP  systems , are based on group technology and parts classiﬁ  cation and coding (Section  38.5). In these systems, a standard process plan is stored in computer ﬁ  les for each  part code number. The standard plans are based on current part routings in use in  the factory, or on an ideal plan that is prepared for each family. Retrieval CAPP  systems operate as indicated in Figure 39.5. The user begins by identifying the GT  code of the part for which the process plan is to be determined. A search is made of  the part family ﬁ  le to determine if a standard route sheet exists for the given part  code. If the ﬁ  le contains a process plan for the part, it is retrieved and displayed for  the user. The standard process plan is examined to determine whether modiﬁ  cations  are necessary. Although the new part has the same code number, minor differences  in the processes might be required to make the part. The standard plan is edited  accordingly. The capacity to alter an existing process plan is why retrieval CAPP  systems are also called variant systems.  

![](images/d971fd49383deed3555c86f12900be1374ba0f2b39124538055713c1f624ebfa.jpg)  
FIGURE 39.5  Operation of a retrieval computer-aided process planning system. (Source: [6].)  

If the ﬁ  le does not contain a standard process plan for the given code number,  the user may search the ﬁ  le for a similar code number for which a standard rout- ing exists. By editing the existing process plan, or by starting from scratch, the user  develops the process plan for the new part. This becomes the standard process plan  for the new part code number.  

The ﬁ  nal step is the process plan formatter, which prints the route sheet in the  proper format. The formatter may access other application programs; for example,  to determine cutting conditions for machine tool operations, to calculate standard  times for machining operations, or to compute cost estimates.  

Generative CAPP Systems  Generative CAPP systems are an alternative to  retrieval systems. Rather than retrieving and editing existing plans from a database,  a generative system creates the process plan using systematic procedures that might  be applied by a human planner. In a fully generative CAPP system, the process  sequence is planned without human assistance and without predeﬁ  ned standard  plans.  

Designing a generative CAPP system is a problem in the ﬁ  eld of expert systems,  a branch of artiﬁ  cial intelligence.  Expert systems  are computer programs capable of  solving complex problems that normally require a human who has years of educa- tion and experience. Process planning ﬁ  ts that deﬁ  nition. Several ingredients are  required in a fully generative CAPP system:  

1.  Knowledge base . The technical knowledge of manufacturing and the logic used  by successful process planners must be captured and coded into a computer  program. An expert system applied to process planning requires the knowledge  and logic of human process planners to be incorporated into a knowledge base.  Generative CAPP systems then use the knowledge base to solve process plan- ning problems; that is, to create route sheets.  

2.  Computer-compatible part description . Generative process planning requires  a computer-compatible description of the part. The description contains all the  pertinent data needed to plan the process sequence. Two possible descriptions  are (1) the geometric model of the part developed on a CAD system during  product design or (2) a group technology code number of the part deﬁ  ning its  features in signiﬁ  cant detail.  

3.  Inference engine . A generative CAPP system requires the capability to apply  the planning logic and process knowledge contained in the knowledge base to  a given part description. The CAPP system applies its knowledge base to solve  a speciﬁ  c problem of planning the process for a new part. This problem-solving  procedure is referred to as the inference engine in the terminology of expert  systems. By using its knowledge base and inference engine, the CAPP system  synthesizes a new process plan for each new part presented to it.  

Beneﬁ  ts of CAPP  Beneﬁ  ts of computer-automated process planning include the  following: (1) process rationalization and standardization—automated process plan- ning leads to more logical and consistent process plans than when traditional proc- ess planning is used; (2) increased productivity of process planners—the systematic  approach and availability of standard process plans in the data ﬁ  les permit a greater  number of process plans to be developed by the user; (3) reduced lead time to pre- pare process plans; (4) improved legibility compared to manually prepared route  sheets; and (5) ability to interface CAPP programs with other application programs,  such as cost estimating, work standards, and others.  

#  Other Manufacturing Engineering Functions  

Although process planning is the principal function of manufacturing engineering,  two additional functions are (1) problem solving and continuous improvement, and  (2) design for manufacturing and assembly. A related topic is concurrent engineering.  

# 39.2.1  PROBLEM SOLVING AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT  

Problems arise in manufacturing that require technical staff support beyond what is  normally available in the line organization of the production departments. Provid- ing this technical support is one of the responsibilities of manufacturing engineering.  The problems are usually speciﬁ  c to the particular technologies of the processes per- formed in the operating department. In machining, the problems may relate to selec- tion of cutting tools, ﬁ  xtures that do not work properly, parts with out-of-tolerance  conditions, or nonoptimal cutting conditions. In plastic molding, the problems may  be excessive ﬂ  ash, parts sticking in the mold, or any of several defects that can occur  in a molded part. These problems are technical, and engineering expertise is often  required to solve them.  

In some cases, the solution may require a design change; for example, changing  the tolerance on a part dimension to eliminate a ﬁ  nish grinding operation while still  achieving the functionality of the part. The manufacturing engineer is responsible  for developing the proper solution to the problem and proposing the engineering  change to the design department.  

One of the areas that is ripe for improvement is setup time. The procedures  involved in changing over from one production setup to the next (i.e., in batch pro- duction) are time consuming and costly. Manufacturing engineers are responsible  for analyzing changeover procedures and ﬁ  nding ways to reduce the time required  to perform them. Some of the approaches used in setup reduction are described in  Section 39.4.  

In addition to solving current technical problems (“ﬁ  re ﬁ  ghting,” as it might be  called), the manufacturing engineering department is often responsible for continu- ous improvement projects. Continuous improvement means constantly searching  for and implementing ways to reduce cost, improve quality, and increase productiv- ity in manufacturing. It is accomplished one project at a time. Depending on the type  of problem area, it may involve a project team whose membership includes not only  manufacturing engineers, but also other personnel such as product designers, quality  engineers, and production workers.  

# 39.2.2  DESIGN FOR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY  

Much of the process planning function discussed in Section 39.1 is preempted by  decisions made in product design. Decisions on material, part geometry, tolerances,  surface ﬁ  nish, grouping of parts into subassemblies, and assembly techniques limit  the available manufacturing processes that can be used to make a given part. If  the product engineer designs an aluminum sand casting with features that can be  achieved only by machining (e.g., ﬂ  at surfaces with good ﬁ  nishes, close tolerances,  and threaded holes), then the process planner has no choice but to plan for sand  casting followed by the required machining operations. If the product designer spec- iﬁ  es a collection of sheet-metal stampings to be assembled by threaded fasteners,  then the process planner must lay out the series of blanking, punching, and forming  steps to fabricate the stampings and then assemble them. In both of these examples,  a plastic molded part might be a superior design, both functionally and economically.  It is important for the manufacturing engineer to act as an advisor to the design  engineer in matters of manu fact ur ability because manu fact ur ability matters, not  only to the production departments but to the design engineer. A product design  that is functionally superior and at the same time can be produced at minimum  cost holds the greatest promise of success in the marketplace. Successful careers in  design engineering are built on successful products.  

Terms often associated with this attempt to favorably inﬂ  uence the manufacturabil- ity of a product are  design for manufacturing  (DFM) and  design for assembly  (DFA).  Of course, DFM and DFA are inextricably coupled, so refer to the pair as DFM/A.  Design for manufacturing and assembly is an approach to product design that system- atically includes considerations of manu fact ur ability and assemblability in the design.  DFM/A includes organizational changes and design principles and guidelines.  

To implement DFM/A, a company must change its organizational structure,  either formally or informally, to provide closer interaction and better communica- tion between design and manufacturing personnel. This is often accomplished by  forming project teams consisting of product designers, manufacturing engineers, and  other specialties (e.g., quality engineers, material scientists) to design the product.  In some companies, design engineers are required to spend some career time in  manufacturing to learn about the problems encountered in making things. Another  possibility is to assign manufacturing engineers to the product design department as  full-time consultants.  

DFM/A also includes principles and guidelines that indicate how to design a  given product for maximum manu fact ur ability. Many of these are universal design  guidelines, such as those presented in Table 39.5. They are rules of thumb that can be  applied to nearly any product design situation. In addition, several of our chapters on  manufacturing processes include design guidelines that are speciﬁ  c to those processes.  

The guidelines are sometimes in conﬂ  ict. For example, one guideline for part  design is to make the geometry as simple as possible. Yet, in design for assembly,  it is often desirable to combine features of several assembled parts into a single  component to reduce part count and assembly time. In these instances, design for  manufacture conﬂ  icts with design for assembly, and a compromise must be found  that achieves the best balance between opposing sides of the conﬂ  ict.  

Beneﬁ  ts typically cited for DFM/A include (1) shorter time to bring the product  to market, (2) smoother transition into production, (3) fewer components in the ﬁ  nal  product, (4) easier assembly, (5) lower costs of production, (6) higher product qual- ity, and (7) greater customer satisfaction [1], [4].  

# 39.2.3  CONCURRENT ENGINEERING  

Concurrent engineering refers to an approach to product design in which compa- nies attempt to reduce the elapsed time required to bring a new product to market  by integrating design engineering, manufacturing engineering, and other functions  

# TABLE  •  39.5  General principles and guidelines in design for manufacturing and assembly.  

Minimize number of components . Assembly costs are reduced. The ﬁ  nal product is more reliable because there are  fewer connections. Disassembly for maintenance and ﬁ  eld service is easier. Reduced part count usually means  automation is easier to implement. Work-in-process is reduced, and there are fewer inventory control problems.  Fewer parts need to be purchased, which reduces ordering costs.  

Use standard commercially available components . Design time and effort are reduced. Design of custom- engineered components is avoided. There are fewer part numbers. Inventory control is facilitated. Quantity  discounts may be possible.  

Use common parts across product lines . There is an opportunity to apply group technology (Section 38.5).  Implementation of manufacturing cells may be possible. Quantity discounts may be possible.  

Design for ease of part fabrication . Net shape and near net shape processes may be feasible. Part geometry is  simpliﬁ  ed, and unnecessary features are avoided. Unnecessary surface ﬁ  nish requirements should be avoided;  otherwise, additional processing may be needed.  

Design parts with tolerances that are within process capability . Tolerances tighter than the process capability  (Section 40.2) should be avoided; otherwise, additional processing or sortation will be required. Bilateral tolerances  should be speciﬁ  ed.  

Design the product to be foolproof during assembly . Assembly should be unambiguous. Components should be  designed so they can be assembled only one way. Special geometric features must sometimes be added to  components to achieve foolproof assembly.  

Minimize use of ﬂ  exible components . Flexible components include parts made of rubber, belts, gaskets, cables, etc.  Flexible components are generally more difﬁ  cult to handle and assemble.  

Design for ease of assembly . Part features such as chamfers and tapers should be designed on mating parts. Design  the assembly using base parts to which other components are added. The assembly should be designed so that  components are added from one direction, usually vertically. Threaded fasteners (screws, bolts, nuts) should be  avoided where possible, especially when automated assembly is used; instead, fast assembly techniques such as snap  ﬁ  ts and adhesive bonding should be employed. The number of distinct fasteners should be minimized.  

Use modular design . Each subassembly should consist of ﬁ  ve to ﬁ  fteen parts. Maintenance and repair are  facilitated. Automated and manual assembly are implemented more readily. Inventory requirements are reduced.  Final assembly time is minimized.  

Shape parts and products for ease of packaging . The product should be designed so that standard packaging  cartons can be used, which are compatible with automated packaging equipment. Shipment to customer is  facilitated.  

Eliminate or reduce adjustment required . Adjustments are time-consuming in assembly. Designing adjustments  into the product means more opportunities for out-of-adjustment conditions to arise.

in the company. One might argue that concurrent engineering is a logical exten- sion of DFM/A because it includes collaboration of more than just design and  manufacturing, and it attempts to reduce the product launch cycle. The traditional  approach to launch a new product tends to separate the two functions, as illus- trated in Figure 39.6(a). The product design engineer develops the new design,  sometimes with little regard for the manufacturing capabilities possessed by the  company. There is no interaction between design engineers and manufacturing  engineers who might provide advice on these capabilities and how the product  design might be altered to accommodate them. It is as if a wall exists between the  two functions; when design engineering completes the design, the drawings and  speciﬁ  cations are tossed over the wall so that process planning can commence.  

In a company that practices concurrent engineering (also known as  simultane- ous engineering ), manufacturing planning begins while the product design is being  developed, as pictured in Figure 39.6(b). Manufacturing engineering becomes

involved early in the product development cycle. In addition, other functions are  also involved, such as ﬁ  eld service, quality engineering, the manufacturing depart- ments, vendors supplying critical components, and in some cases customers who will  use the product. All of these functions can contribute to a product design that not  only performs well functionally, but is also manufacturable, assemblable, inspect- able, testable, serviceable, maintainable, free of defects, and safe. All viewpoints have  been combined to design a product of high quality that will deliver customer satis- faction. And through early involvement, rather than a procedure of reviewing the  ﬁ  nal design and suggesting changes after it is too late to conveniently make them,  the total product development cycle is substantially reduced.  

Concurrent engineering embraces other objectives beyond DFM/A such as design  for quality, design for life cycle, and design for cost. With the importance of quality  in international competition, and the demonstrated success of those companies that  have been able to produce products of high quality, one must conclude that  design  for quality  is very important. Chapter 40 deals with quality control and includes a  discussion of several quality approaches related to product design.  

Design for life cycle  refers to the product after it has been manufactured. In many  cases, a product can involve a signiﬁ  cant cost to the customer beyond the purchase  price. These costs include installation, maintenance and repair, spare parts, future  upgrading of the product, safety during operation, and disposition of the product at  the end of its useful life. The price paid for the product may be a small portion of its  total cost when life cycle costs are included. Some customers (e.g., federal govern- ment) consider life cycle costs in their purchasing decisions. The manufacturer must  often include service contracts that limit customer vulnerability to excessive main- tenance and service costs. In these cases, accurate estimates of these life cycle costs  must be included in the total product cost.  

A product’s cost is a major factor in determining its commercial success. Cost  affects the price charged for the product and the proﬁ  t made on it.  Design for prod- uct cost  refers to the efforts of a company to identify the impact of design decisions  on overall product costs and to control those costs through optimal design. Many of  the DFM/A guidelines are directed at reducing product cost.  

#  Production Planning and Control  

Production planning and control are the manufacturing support systems concerned  with logistics problems in the production function.  Production planning  is con- cerned with planning what products are to be produced, what quantities, and when.  It also considers the resources required to accomplish the plan.  Production control determines whether the resources to execute the plan have been provided and, if  not, takes the necessary action to correct the deﬁ  ciencies.  

The problems in production planning and control are different for different types  of manufacturing. One of the important factors is the relationship between product  variety and production quantity (Section 1.1.2). At one extreme is  job shop pro- duction , in which different product types are each produced in low quantities. The  products are often complex, consisting of many components, each of which must be  processed through multiple operations. Solving the logistics problems in such a plant  requires detailed planning—scheduling and coordinating the large numbers of dif- ferent components and processing steps for the different products.  

At the other extreme is  mass production , in which a single product (with perhaps  some model variations) is produced in very large quantities (up to millions of units).  The logistics problems in mass production are simple if the product and process are  simple. In more complex situations, such as the production of automobiles and major  appliances, the product is an assembly consisting of many components, and the facil- ity is organized as a production line (Section 38.2). The logistics problem in operat- ing such a plant is to get each component to the right workstation at the right time  so that it can be assembled to the product as it passes through that station. Failure  to solve this problem can result in stoppage of the entire production line for lack of  a critical part.  

To distinguish between these two extremes in terms of the issues in production  planning and control, the planning function is emphasized in a job shop, whereas the  control function is emphasized in mass production of assembled products. There are  many variations between these extremes, with accompanying differences in the way  production planning and control are implemented.  

Figure 39.7 presents a block diagram depicting the activities of a modern pro- duction planning and control system and their interrelationships. The activities can  be divided into three phases: (1) aggregate production planning, (2) detailed plan- ning of material and capacity requirements, and (3) purchasing and shop ﬂ  oor con- trol. Our discussion of production planning and control in this section is organized  around this framework.  

# 39.3.1  AGGREGATE PLANNING AND THE MASTER PRODUCTION SCHEDULE  

Any manufacturing ﬁ  rm must have a business plan, and the plan must include what  products will be produced, how many, and when. The manufacturing plan should take  into account current orders and sales forecasts, inventory levels, and plant capacity.  

![](images/00fc74d3124ec1945d0ed1006c841ef57a56c28de19aa094f6d85495afc4db67.jpg)  
FIGURE 39.7  Activities in a production planning and control system.  

The  aggregate production plan  indicates production output levels for major  product lines rather than speciﬁ  c products. It must be coordinated with the sales  and marketing plan of the company. Aggregate planning is therefore a high-level  corporate planning activity, although details of the planning process are delegated  to staff. The aggregate plan must reconcile the marketing plans for current products  and new products under development against the capacity resources available to  make those products.  

The planned output levels of the major product lines in the aggregate schedule  must be converted into a speciﬁ  c schedule of individual products. This is called the  master production schedule  (or  master schedule , for short), and it lists the products  to be manufactured, when they should be completed, and in what quantities.  

Three categories of items are listed in the master schedule: (1) ﬁ  rm customer  orders, (2) forecasted demand, and (3) spare parts. Customer orders for speciﬁ  c  products usually obligate the company to a delivery date that has been promised to  a customer by the sales department. The second category consists of production out- put levels based on forecasted demand, in which statistical forecasting techniques  are applied to previous demand patterns, estimates by the sales staff, and other  sources. The third category is demand for individual component parts—repair parts  to be stocked in the ﬁ  rm’s service department. Some companies exclude this third  category from the master schedule because it does not represent end products.  

The master production schedule must consider the lead times required to order  raw materials and components, fabricate parts in the factory, and then assemble and  test the ﬁ  nal products. Depending on type of product, these lead times can run from  several months to more than a year. It is usually considered to be ﬁ  xed in the near  term, meaning that changes are not allowed within about a six-week horizon. How- ever, adjustments in the schedule beyond six weeks are possible to cope with shifts in  demand or new product opportunities. It should therefore be noted that the aggre- gate production plan is not the only input to the master schedule. Other drivers that  may cause it to deviate from the aggregate plan include new customer orders and  changes in sales over the near term.  

# 39.3.2  MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS PLANNING  

Two techniques for planning and controlling production are used in industry, depend- ing on product variety and production quantities. This section covers procedures for  job shop and midrange production of assembled products. Section 39.4 examines  procedures appropriate for high production.  

Material requirements planning (MRP) is a computational procedure used to con- vert the master production schedule for end products into a detailed schedule for raw  materials and components used in the end products. The detailed schedule indicates  the quantities of each item, when it must be ordered, and when it must be delivered  to implement the master schedule.  Capacity requirements planning  (Section 39.3.3)  coordinates labor and equipment resources with material requirements.  

MRP is most appropriate for job shop and batch production of products that have  multiple components, each of which must be purchased and/or fabricated. It is a tech- nique that determines the quantities of items used in end products. Once the number  of end products has been decided and included in the master production schedule,  then the numbers of each component can be directly computed. For example, each  car listed in the master schedule needs four tires (ﬁ  ve, if the spare is included). Thus,  if the production schedule calls for 1000 cars to be produced in a certain week, the  plant needs to order 4000 tires for those cars. Demand for the end products may be  forecasted, but materials and parts used in the end products are not.  

MRP is relatively straightforward in concept. Its application is complicated by  the sheer magnitude of the data that must be processed. The master schedule speci- ﬁ  es the production of ﬁ  nal products in terms of month-by-month deliveries. Each  product may contain hundreds of components. These components are produced  from raw materials, some of which are common among the components (e.g., sheet  steel for stampings). Some of the components themselves may be common to sev- eral different products (called  common use items  in MRP). For each product, the  components are assembled into simple subassemblies, which are added to form  other subassemblies, and so on, until the ﬁ  nal products are completed. Each step  in the sequence consumes time. All of these factors must be accounted for in mate- rial requirements planning. Although each calculation is simple, the large number  of calculations and massive amounts of data require that MRP be implemented by  computer.  

The lead time for a job is the time that must be allowed to complete the job from  start to ﬁ  nish. There are two kinds of lead times in MRP: ordering lead times and  manufacturing lead times.  Ordering lead time  is the time required from initiation of  the purchase requisition to receipt of the item from the vendor. If the item is a raw  material stocked by the vendor, the ordering lead time should be relatively short,  perhaps a few days. If the item is fabricated, the lead time may be substantial, per- haps several months.  Manufacturing lead time  is the time required to produce the  item in the company’s own plant, from order release to completion. It includes lead  times for both making the parts and assembling the end products.  

Inputs to the MRP System  For the MRP processor to function properly, it must  receive inputs from several ﬁ  les: (1) master production schedule, (2) bill of materials  ﬁ  le, (3) inventory records, and (4) capacity requirements planning. Figure 39.7 shows  the data ﬂ  ow into the MRP processor and the recipients of its output reports.  

The master production schedule was discussed in Section 39.3.1, and capacity  requirements planning is covered in Section 39.3.3. The  bill-of-materials ﬁ  le  lists  the component parts and subassemblies that make up each product. It is used to  compute the requirements for raw materials and components used in the end prod- ucts listed in the master schedule. The  inventory record ﬁ  le  identiﬁ  es each item (by  part number) and provides a time-phased record of its inventory status. This means  that not only is the current quantity of the item listed, but also any future changes in  inventory status that will occur and when they will occur.  

How MRP Works  Based on the inputs from the master schedule, bill-of-materials  ﬁ  le, and inventory record ﬁ  le, the MRP processor computes how many of each com- ponent and raw material will be needed in future time periods by “exploding” the  end product schedule to include these items. How many tires and other components  must be ordered to produce the numbers of cars listed in each time period (e.g., each  week) of the master production schedule?  

The MRP computations must deal with several complicating factors. First, com- ponent and subassembly quantities must be adjusted for any inventories on hand or  on order. Second, quantities of common use items must be combined during parts  explosion to obtain a total requirement for each component and raw material in the  schedule. Third, the time-phased delivery of end products must be converted into  time-phased requirements for components and materials by factoring in the appro- priate lead times. For every unit of ﬁ  nal product listed in the master schedule, the  required number of components of each type must be ordered or fabricated, taking  into account its ordering and/or manufacturing lead times. For each component, the  raw material must be ordered, accounting for its ordering lead time. And assembly  lead times must be considered in the scheduling of subassemblies and ﬁ  nal products.  

Output Reports  MRP generates various output reports that can be used in plan- ning and managing plant operations. The reports include (1) order releases, which  authorize the orders planned by the MRP system; (2) planned order releases in  future periods; (3) rescheduling notices, indicating changes in due dates for open  orders; (4) cancellation notices, which indicate that certain open orders have been  canceled due to changes in the master schedule; (5) inventory status reports; (6) per- formance reports; (7) exception reports, showing deviations from schedule, overdue  orders, scrap, and so forth; and (8) inventory forecasts, which project inventory levels  in future periods.  

# 39.3.3  CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS PLANNING  

Capacity requirements planning is concerned with determining the labor and equip- ment requirements needed to achieve the master production schedule. It is also  concerned with identifying the ﬁ  rm’s long-term future capacity needs. Finally and  importantly, capacity planning serves to identify production resource limitations so  that a realistic master production schedule can be planned.  

A realistic master schedule must take into account the manufacturing capa- bilities of the plant that is to make the products. The ﬁ  rm must be aware of its  production capacity and must plan for changes in capacity to meet changing pro- duction requirements speciﬁ  ed in the master schedule. The relationship between  capacity planning and other functions in production planning and control is  shown in Figure 39.7. The master schedule is reduced to material and component  requirements using MRP. These requirements provide estimates of the required  labor hours and other resources needed to produce the components. The required  resources are then compared to plant capacity over the planning horizon. If the  master schedule is not compatible with plant capacity, adjustments must be made  either in the schedule or in plant capacity.  

Plant capacity can be adjusted in the short term and in the long term. Short- term capacity adjustments include (1)  employment levels —increasing or decreasing  the number of workers in the plant; (2)  shift hours —increasing or decreasing the  number of labor hours per shift through the use of overtime or reduced hours; (3)  number of work shifts —increasing or decreasing the number of shifts worked per  production period by authorizing evening and night shifts and/or weekend shifts;  (4)  inventory stockpiling —this tactic is used to maintain steady employment levels  during slow demand periods; (5)  order backlogs —delaying deliveries to the cus- tomer during busy periods when production resources are insufﬁ  cient to keep up  with demand; and (6)  subcontracting —contracting work to outside shops during  busy periods or taking in extra work during slack periods.  

Long-term capacity adjustments include possible changes in production capacity  that generally require long lead times, including the following types of decisions: (1)  new equipment —investments in additional machines, more productive machines, or  new types of machines to match future changes in product design; (2)  new plants — construction of new plants or purchase of existing plants from other companies; and  (3)  plant closings —closing plants not needed in the future.  

# 39.3.4  SHOP FLOOR CONTROL  

The third phase in production planning and control in Figure 39.7 is concerned with  releasing production orders, monitoring and controlling progress of the orders, and  acquiring up-to-date information on order status. The purchasing department is  responsible for these functions among suppliers. The term  shop ﬂ  oor control  is used  to describe these functions when accomplished in the company’s own factories. In  basic terms, shop ﬂ  oor control is concerned with managing work-in-progress in the  factory. It is most relevant in job shop and batch production, where there are a vari- ety of different orders in the shop that must be scheduled and tracked according to  their relative priorities.  

A typical shop ﬂ  oor control system consists of three modules: (1) order release,  (2) order scheduling, and (3) order progress. The three modules and how they relate  to other functions in the factory are depicted in Figure 39.8. The computer software  

![](images/9f5e600dd3314f97cbea2c2a26c22b7abe4851bb2f05b2b6563b8df1ea956429.jpg)  
FIGURE 39.8  Three modules in a shop ﬂ  oor control system, and interconnections with other production planning  and control functions.  

that supports shop ﬂ  oor control is referred to as a  manufacturing execution system ,  which includes the capability to interact in real time with users seeking status infor- mation in any of the three phases.  

Order Release  Order release in shop ﬂ  oor control generates the documents  needed to process a production order through the factory. The documents are some- times called the shop packet; it typically consists of (1) route sheet, (2) material  requisitions to draw the starting materials from stores, (3) job cards to report direct  labor time used on the order, (4) move tickets to authorize transport of parts to  subsequent work centers in the routing, and (5) parts list—required for assembly  jobs. In a traditional factory, these are paper documents that move with the produc- tion order and are used to track its progress through the shop. In modern factories,  automated methods such as bar code technology and shop ﬂ  oor computers are used  to monitor order status, making some or all of the paper documents unnecessary.  

Order release is driven by two principal inputs, as indicated in Figure 39.8: (1)  material requirements planning, which provides the authorization to produce; and  (2) engineering and manufacturing database that indicates product structure and  process planning details required to generate the documents that accompany the  order through the shop.  

Order Scheduling  Order scheduling assigns the production orders to work  centers in the factory. It serves as the dispatching function in production control.  In order scheduling, a dispatch list is prepared indicating which orders should be  accomplished at each work center. It also provides relative priorities for the dif- ferent jobs (e.g., by showing due dates for each job). The dispatch list helps the  department foreman assign work and allocate resources to achieve the master  schedule.  

Order scheduling addresses two problems in production planning and con- trol: machine loading and job sequencing. To schedule production orders through  the factory, they must ﬁ  rst be assigned to work centers. Assigning orders to work  centers is called  machine loading . Loading all of the work centers in the plant is  called  shop loading . Since the number of production orders is likely to exceed the  number of work centers, each work center will have a queue of orders waiting to  be processed.  

Job sequencing  deals with the problem of deciding the sequence in which to  process jobs through a given machine. The processing sequence is decided by  means of priorities among the jobs in the queue. The relative priorities are deter- mined by a function called  priority control . Some of the rules used to establish  priorities for production orders in a plant include (1)  ﬁ  rst-come-ﬁ  rst-serve — orders are processed in the sequence in which they arrive at the work center; (2)  earliest due date —orders with earlier due dates are given higher priorities; (3)  shortest processing time —orders with shorter processing times are given higher  priorities; and (4)  least slack time —orders with the least slack in their schedule  are given higher priorities (slack time is deﬁ  ned as the difference between the  time remaining until due date and the process time remaining). When a job is  completed at one work center, it is moved to the next machine in its routing. It  becomes part of the machine loading for that work center, and priority control  is again used to determine the sequence among jobs to be processed at that  machine.  

Order Progress  Order progress in shop ﬂ  oor control monitors the status of the  orders, work-in-process, and other parameters in the plant that indicate progress and  performance. The objective is to provide information to manage production based  on data collected from the factory.  

Various techniques are available to collect data from factory operations. The  techniques range from clerical procedures requiring workers to submit paper forms  that are later compiled, to highly automated systems requiring minimal human par- ticipation. The term  factory data collection system  is sometimes used for these tech- niques. More complete coverage of this topic is presented in [6].  

Information presented to management is often summarized in the form of  reports. These include (1)  work order status reports , which indicate status of pro- duction orders, including the work center where each order is located, processing  hours remaining before each order will be completed, whether the job is on time,  and priority level; (2)  progress reports  that report shop performance during a cer- tain time period such as a week or month—how many orders were completed dur- ing the period, how many orders should have been completed during the period but  were not completed, and so forth; and (3)  exception reports  that indicate deviations  from the production schedule, such as overdue jobs. These reports are helpful to  management in deciding resource allocation issues, authorizing overtime, and iden- tifying problem areas that adversely affect achievement of the master production  schedule.  

# 39.3.5  ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING  

The ﬁ  rst MRP systems released in the 1970s were limited to the planning of pur- chase orders and production work orders derived from the master production sched- ule. They did not include capacity planning and feedback of data from the factory.  These deﬁ  ciencies became apparent by the 1980s, and additional capabilities were  added to the basic MRP packages, including capacity requirements planning and  shop ﬂ  oor control. The term manufacturing resource planning was used to distin- guish the enhanced systems from the initial material requirements planning, and the  abbreviation MRP II was adopted.  Manufacturing resource planning  can be deﬁ  ned  “as a computer-based system for planning, scheduling, and controlling the materials,  resources, and supporting activities needed to meet the master production sched- ule.” 1  MRP II integrates material requirements planning, capacity requirements  planning, and shop ﬂ  oor control into one system.  

Further improvements were made to MRP II during the 1990s by adding features  that went beyond just the manufacturing activities of a ﬁ  rm by including all of the oper- ations and functions of the entire enterprise. Also, the new packages, called enterprise  resource planning, were applicable to service organizations as well as ﬁ  rms in the pro- duction industries.  Enterprise resource planning  (ERP) is a computer-based “system  that organizes and integrates all of the data and business functions of an organization  through a single, central database.” 2  For a manufacturing ﬁ  rm, ERP accomplishes the  functions of MRP II. Additional functions in most ERP systems include sales and serv- ice, marketing, logistics, distribution, inventory control, accounting and ﬁ  nance, human  resources, and customer relationship management. ERP systems consist of multiple  software modules, each devoted to its particular function. A user company may elect  to include only certain modules of particular interest in its ERP system. For example, a  service organization may have no need for modules related to manufacturing.  

Today’s ERP systems are based on open architecture standards, which means  that a user company can purchase certain modules from one company and other  modules from a different company and integrate them into their own ERP system.  This open architecture feature gave rise to the term ERP II during the early 2000s.  Also, enterprise resource planning can be implemented as a cloud-based system, in  which the user company’s data reside in large data centers external to the company  and accessed through the Internet [19]. This permits them to avoid the expenses of  investing in and maintaining their own central database.  

ERP II is installed as a client-server system that serves the entire company rather  than individual plants as MRP and MRP II often do. Employees access and work  with the system using their personal computers. Because ERP has only one data- base, it avoids problems of data redundancy and conﬂ  icting information that arise  when an organization maintains multiple databases. It also minimizes time delays  and compatibility issues associated with different databases and software modules.  With ERP , all employees have access to the same data depending on their individual  responsibilities and “need-to-know” authorizations.  

# 39.4 39.4  Just-In-Time Delivery Systems  

Just-in-ime (JIT) is an approach to production control that was developed by Toyota  Motors in Japan to minimize inventories. Work-in-process and other inventories are  viewed as waste that should be eliminated. Inventory ties up investment funds and takes  up space. To reduce this form of waste, the JIT approach includes a number of princi- ples and procedures aimed at reducing inventories, either directly or indirectly. JIT is  an important component of lean production, a principal goal of which is to reduce all  forms of waste in production operations. Lean production is described in Section 39.6.  

Just-in-time procedures have proven most effective in high-volume repetitive man- ufacturing, such as the automobile industry [10]. The potential for in-process inventory  accumulation in this type of manufacturing is signiﬁ  cant because both the quantities  of products and the number of components per product are large. A just-in-time sys- tem produces exactly the right number of each component required to satisfy the next  operation in the manufacturing sequence just when that component is needed; that  is, “just in time.” The ideal batch size is one part. As a practical matter, more than one  part are produced at a time, but the batch size is kept small. Under JIT, producing too  many units is to be avoided as much as producing too few units. JIT has been adopted  by many U.S. companies in both the automotive and other manufacturing industries.  

Although the principal theme in JIT is inventory reduction, this cannot simply  be mandated. Several requisites must be pursued to make it possible: (1) stable  production schedules; (2) small batch sizes and short setup times; (3) on-time deliv- ery; (4) defect-free components and materials; (5) reliable production equipment;  (6) pull system of production control; (7) a work force that is capable, committed,  and cooperative; and (8) a dependable supplier base.  

Stable Schedule  For JIT to be successful, work must ﬂ  ow smoothly with mini- mal perturbations from normal operations. Perturbations require changes in oper- ating procedures—increases and decreases in production rate, unscheduled setups,  variations from the regular work routine, and other exceptions. When perturbations  occur in downstream operations (i.e., ﬁ  nal assembly), they tend to be ampliﬁ  ed in  upstream operations (i.e., parts feeding). A master production schedule that remains  relatively constant over time is one way of achieving smooth work ﬂ  ow and minimiz- ing disturbances and changes in production. The term  production leveling  is some- times used for this practice of maintaining a constant production output.  

Small Batch Sizes and Setup Reduction  Two requirements for minimizing  inventories are small batch sizes and short setup times. Large batch sizes mean  longer production runs and higher inventory levels, both in-process and ﬁ  nal inven- tories. Long setup times are costly in both labor and lost production time, but they  necessitate long production runs to economically justify the setups. Thus, large batch  sizes and long setup times are closely correlated, and they result in higher operating  costs in the factory. Instead of tolerating them, efforts are focused on reducing setup  time, thereby permitting smaller batch sizes and lower work-in-process levels.  

Some of the approaches used to reduce setup time include (1) performing as  much of the setup as possible while the previous job is still running; (2) using quick- acting clamping devices instead of bolts and nuts; (3) eliminating or minimizing  adjustments in the setup; and (4) using group technology and cellular manufacturing  so that similar part styles are produced on the same equipment. These approaches  have sometimes resulted in dramatic decreases in setup times. Reductions of  $95\%$   and greater have been reported in the literature.  

On-Time Delivery, Zero Defects, and Reliable Equipment  Success of just- in-time production requires near perfection in on-time delivery, parts quality, and  equipment reliability. The small lot sizes and parts buffers used in JIT require parts  to be delivered before stock-outs occur at downstream stations. Otherwise, produc- tion must be suspended at these stations for lack of parts. If the delivered parts are  defective, they cannot be used in assembly. This tends to encourage zero defects in  parts fabrication. Workers inspect their own output to make sure it is right before it  proceeds to the next operation.  

Low work-in-process also requires reliable production equipment. Machines that  break down cannot be tolerated in a JIT production system. This emphasizes the  need for reliable equipment designs and preventive maintenance. Toyota’s Total  Productive Maintenance program is discussed in Section 39.6.1.  

Pull System of Production Control  JIT requires a  pull system  of production  control, in which the order to produce parts at a given workstation comes from  the downstream station that uses those parts. As the supply of parts becomes  exhausted at a given station, it “places an order” at the upstream workstation  to replenish the supply. This order provides the authorization for the upstream  station to produce the needed parts. This procedure, repeated at each worksta- tion throughout the plant, has the effect of pulling parts through the production  system. By contrast, a  push system  of production operates by supplying parts to  each station in the plant, in effect driving the work from upstream stations to  downstream stations. MRP is a push system. The risk in a push system is to over- load the factory by scheduling more work than it can handle. This results in large  queues of parts in front of machines that cannot keep up with arriving work. A  poorly implemented MRP system, one that does not include capacity planning,  manifests this risk.  

One famous pull system is the  kanban  system used by Toyota Motors. Kanban  (pronounced kahn-bahn) is a Japanese word meaning  card . The kanban system of  production control is based on the use of cards to authorize production and work  ﬂ  ow in the plant. There are two types of kanbans: (1) production kanbans, and (2)  transport kanbans. A  production kanban  authorizes production of a batch of parts.  The parts are placed in containers, so the batch must consist of just enough parts  to ﬁ  ll the container. Production of additional parts is not permitted. The  transport  kanban  authorizes movement of the container of parts to the next station in the  sequence.  

Refer to Figure 39.9 as the operation of a kanban system is explained. The ﬁ  gure  shows four stations, but B and C are the stations to focus on here. Station B is the  supplier in this pair, and station C is the consumer. Station C supplies downstream  station D. B is supplied by upstream station A. When station C starts work on a full

container, a worker removes the transport kanban from that container and takes it  back to B. The worker ﬁ  nds a full container of parts at B that have just been produced,  removes the production kanban from that container, and places it on a rack at B. The  worker then places the transport kanban in the full container, which authorizes its  movement to station C. The production kanban on the rack at station B authorizes  production of a new batch of parts. Station B produces more than one part style, per- haps for several other downstream stations in addition to C. The scheduling of work  is determined by the order in which the production kanbans are placed on the rack.  

The kanban pull system between stations A and B and between stations C and D  operates the same as it does between stations B and C, described here. This system  of production control avoids unnecessary paperwork. The cards are used over and  over rather than generating new production and transport orders every cycle. An  apparent disadvantage is the considerable labor involvement in material handling  (moving the cards and containers between stations); however, it is claimed that this  promotes teamwork and cooperation among workers.  

Workforce and Supplier Base  Another requirement of a JIT production sys- tem is workers who are cooperative, committed, and capable of performing multiple  tasks. The workers must be ﬂ  exible to produce a variety of part styles at their respec- tive stations, to inspect the quality of their work, and to deal with minor technical  problems with the production equipment so that major breakdowns do not occur.  

Just-in-time extends to the suppliers of the company, who are held to the same stand- ards of on-time delivery, zero defects, and other JIT requisites as the company itself.  Some of the vendor policies used by companies to implement JIT include (1) reducing  the total number of suppliers, (2) selecting suppliers with proven records for meeting  quality and delivery standards, (3) establishing long-term partnerships with suppliers,  and (4) selecting suppliers that are located near the company’s manufacturing plant.  

Just-in-time delivery systems are an important aspect of lean production, which is  focused on reducing waste in production operations, and just-in-time reduces the  waste of too much inventory.  Lean production  can be deﬁ  ned as “an adaptation of  mass production in which workers and work cells are made more ﬂ  exible and efﬁ  - cient by adopting methods that reduce waste in all forms.” 4  Its origins are traced to  the Toyota Production System at Toyota Motors in Japan starting in the 1950s (His- torical Note 39.1). Although its initial applications were in the automotive industry,  the objective of minimizing waste is important in all industries.  

# H istorical  N ote  39.1   Toyota Production System and lean production [7]  

Taiichi Ohno (1912–1990) is the man credited with  president at Toyota Motors when the company was  developing the Toyota Production System in Japan  struggling to overcome the war’s devastating im- following World War II. He was an engineer and vice  pact on the Japanese automobile industry. The auto  

market in Japan in the 1950s was much smaller than  in the United States, so American mass production  techniques could not be used. Ohno recognized that  Toyota’s plants had to operate on a much smaller  scale and be more ﬂ  exible. The situation, as well as  his own aversion to waste, motivated him to develop  some of the procedures of the Toyota Production  System to reduce waste and increase efﬁ  ciency and  product quality. He and his colleagues experiment- ed with and perfected the procedures over several  decades, including just-in-time delivery, the kanban  system, setup time reduction, and control of product  quality.  

Ohno did not use the term “lean production” to  refer to his system. In fact, he died before the term  came into prominence, so he may never have heard  of it. In his book, he called it the “Toyota Production  System” [12].  The term  lean production  was coined by  researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technol- ogy to refer to the techniques and procedures used at  Toyota that explained its success in producing so ef- ﬁ  ciently cars with such high quality. The research was  known as the International Motor Vehicle Program and  documented in the book  The Machine that Changed  the  World  (published in 1991).  The term lean production  appeared in the book’s subtitle.  

In effect, lean production means accomplishing more work with fewer resources by  eliminating waste in manufacturing operations. Activities in manufacturing can be clas- siﬁ  ed into three categories: (1) actual work activities that add value such as processing  steps that alter the product in a positive way, (2) auxiliary work activities that support  the actual work such as loading and unloading a production machine, and (3) wasteful  activities that do not add value and do not support the value-adding activities. If these  wasteful activities were omitted, the product would not be adversely affected.  

Seven forms of waste in manufacturing were identiﬁ  ed in the Toyota Produc- tion System: (1) production of defective parts, (2) production of more parts than  needed, (3) excessive inventories, (4) unnecessary processing steps, (5) unnecessary  movement of workers, (6) unnecessary handling and transport of materials, and (7)  workers waiting [12]. The various systems and procedures developed at Toyota were  designed to reduce or eliminate these seven forms of waste.  

The principal components of the Toyota Production System were just-in-time  delivery, autonomation (which has been deﬁ  ned as “automation with a human  touch”),  and worker involvement. Just-in-time delivery is described in Section 39.4.  The other two components are discussed in the following sections. More complete  treatments of lean production and/or the Toyota Production System are given in  several of our references [3], [6], [7], [10], and [12].  

# 39.5.1  AUTONOMATION  

Autonomation refers to the design of production machines that operate autono- mously so long as they function the way they are supposed to. If and when they  do not operate the way they should, they are designed to stop. Circumstances that  would trigger a machine to stop include producing defective parts and producing  more than the number of parts needed. Other aspects of autonomation include error  prevention and high reliability.  

Stop the Process  The underlying principle is that when something goes wrong,  the process should be stopped so that corrective action can be taken. This applies to  both automatic machines and manually operated processes. Production machines in  the Toyota Production System are designed with sensors and automatic stop devices  that are activated when a defective unit is produced or when the required number  of units have been made. Accordingly, when a machine stops, it draws attention,  either to make adjustments to the process to avoid future defects, or to change over  the process for the next batch of parts. The alternative to autonomation is that the  machine would continue to make bad parts or it would make too many parts.  

The notion of “stop the process” can also be applied to manual production, such  as the ﬁ  nal assembly line in an automobile plant. Workers on the line are empow- ered to stop the line when they discover a problem such as a quality defect. They do  this by means of pull cords that are located along the line. Downtime on an assembly  line draws attention and is costly to the plant. Signiﬁ  cant efforts are made to ﬁ  x the  problem that caused the line to be stopped. Defective components must be avoided  by pursuing the goal of zero defects.  

Error Prevention  A second objective of autonomation is preventing mistakes. Mis- takes in manufacturing include using the wrong tool, starting a process with the  wrong raw material, omitting a processing step on a part, neglecting to add a compo- nent in an assembly operation, incorrectly locating a part in a ﬁ  xture, and incorrectly  locating the ﬁ  xture on the machine. To avoid these and other kinds of mistakes,  devices are designed to detect abnormal conditions in a given operation. Exam- ples include instruments to detect overweight parts, counting devices to determine  whether the correct number of spot welds has been made, and sensors to determine  whether a part has been properly located in a ﬁ  xture. When the device encounters a  mistake, it is designed to respond by stopping the process or providing an audible or  visible alert that an error has occurred.  

Total Productive Maintenance  Just-in-time delivery requires production equip- ment that is highly reliable. When a production machine breaks down, it disrupts the  delivery of parts to the downstream workstation, forcing that machine to be idle. JIT  does not provide for inventory buffers to keep production going when breakdowns  occur.  Total Productive Maintenance  (TPM) is a program that aims to minimize  production losses due to machine failures, malfunctions, and poor utilization. One of  the elements of the program is to hold workers who operate equipment responsible  for routine tasks such as inspecting, cleaning, and lubricating their machines. In some  cases, they also make minor repairs on their equipment.  

Three categories of maintenance are performed on a plant’s equipment by trained  specialists: (1) emergency maintenance, which involves the immediate repair of a  machine that has broken down; (2) preventive maintenance, which consists of routine  repairs designed to avoid or minimize breakdowns; and (3) predictive maintenance,  which attempts to anticipate machine malfunctions by monitoring the equipment for  signs of problems and abnormal behavior. Emergency maintenance is undesirable  because it means the machine is out of action and production has ceased. Preventive  maintenance can be scheduled during hours when the machine is not running, for  example, during the third shift in a plant that runs two shifts. Predictive maintenance is  performed while the machine is running. A TPM program integrates preventive main- tenance and predictive maintenance in order to avoid emergency maintenance.  

One of the metrics used in TPM is overall equipment effectiveness, which com- bines several individual measures of a production machine’s operation, as follows:  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{O E E=A U Y r_{o s}}\end{array}
$$  

where  $O E E=$  overall equipment effectiveness; $A=$  availability, a reliability meas- ure deﬁ  ned as the proportion uptime on the equipment;  $U=$  utilization, the propor- tion of the available time that the machine is actually running;  $Y=$  yield of accept- able product, a quality measure deﬁ  ned as the proportion of good product to total  output; and $r_{o s}=$  ratio of the actual operating speed of the machine relative to its  designed operating speed. The objective of TPM is to make  $O E E$  as close to  $100\%$   as possible.  

# 39.5.2  WORKER INVOLVEMENT  

This is the third component of lean production, as practiced in the Toyota Produc- tion System. Three aspects of worker involvement are discussed in the following  paragraphs: (1) continuous improvement, (2) visual management, and (3) standard  work procedures.  

Continuous Improvement  This topic was brieﬂ  y discussed in the context of manu- facturing engineering in Section 39.2.1. In lean production, continuous improvement  projects are carried out by worker teams. The projects are focused on problems related  to productivity, quality, safety, maintenance, and any other area that is of interest to the  organization. Members of each team are selected on the basis of their knowledge of  the particular problem area. Teams may consist of workers from more than one depart- ment. They perform their regular duties in their respective departments and serve on  the team part-time, holding several meetings per month, with each meeting lasting  about an hour. The company beneﬁ  ts when the problems are solved, and the workers  beneﬁ  t by being recognized for their contributions and improving their technical skills.  

Visual Management  This refers to the notion that the status of a work situation  is usually obvious just be looking at it. If something is amiss, it should be self-evident  to the observer. This applies to individual workstations. If a machine has stopped,  this can be seen. It also applies to the entire plant. It should be possible to view the  entire interior of the plant, and so objects that unnecessarily obstruct the view are  removed. For example, build-up of work-in-process is limited to a certain maximum  height in the plant (of course, JIT should limit the build-up of inventory anyway).  

Workers are involved in visual management in several ways. For example, the  kanbans used in just-in-time delivery systems are a visual mechanism for control- ling production and movement of materials in the plant. Also, workers and supervi- sors can observe the status of plant operations through the use of  andon boards ,  which are overhead light panels located above sections of the plant. Using different  colored lights, they indicate the status of operations. For instance, green indicates  normal operation, red indicates a line stoppage. Other color codes may be used to  indicate impending material shortages, need for a setup changeover, and so forth.  Other elements of visual management include the extensive use of drawings, pic- tures, and diagrams in worker training programs, and promoting good housekeeping  practices at employees’ workstations (so that workers work in a clean and visible  work space).  

Standard Work Procedures  Standardized work procedures and standard times  are used in the Toyota Production System with the objectives of increasing productiv- ity, balancing workloads, and minimizing work-in-process. The procedures document

Task times at each  machine are labeled  inside each machine  block.  

the work elements and their element times in each repetitive task performed by work- ers. For workers responsible for multiple machines operating under semi-automatic  cycle, the procedures indicate the sequence of machines and the task required at each  machine. The sequence is designed to minimize idle times of the worker and machines.  One of the objectives in designing these tasks and work sequences is to make the rate  of parts production in these operations equal to the respective demand rates for the  parts. When this is achieved, overproduction is avoided and work-in-process inven- tory is minimized, consistent with just-in-time delivery.  

Production is often organized within work cells, which are teams of workers and  machines arranged in sequential order to produce parts in small batch sizes. The  cells are often U-shaped as shown in Figure 39.10 rather than straight line. This con- ﬁ  guration is said to promote teamwork and camaraderie amongst the workers. Each  worker may operate more than one machine in the cell, as suggested in the ﬁ  gure,  and the tasks are assigned to workers so that their workloads are balanced and the  production cycle time is consistent with the demand rate for the part.

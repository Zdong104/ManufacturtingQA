MANUFACTURING COST MODELS
In this section, the cycle time analysis is used to estimate the costs of production, 
which include not only the cost of time but also material and overhead. The cost of 
time consists of labor and equipment costs, which are applied to the average produc-
tion time per piece as cost rates (e.g., $/hr). Thus, our cost model for production cost 
per piece can be stated as follows:
 Cpc /H11005 Cm /H11001 (CL /H11001 Ceq)Tp /H11001 Ct (1.6)
where Cpc /H11005 cost per piece, $/pc; Cm /H11005 starting material cost, $/pc; CL /H11005 labor cost 
rate, $/min; Ceq /H11005 equipment cost rate, $/min; Ct /H11005 cost of tooling that is used in the 
unit operation, $/pc; and Tp /H11005 average production time per piece, min/pc. If appli-
cable, the cost of tooling Ct must be determined by dividing the actual cost of the 
tooling by the number of pieces between tool changes.

Overhead Costs  The two cost rates, CL and Ceq, include overhead costs, which 
consist of all of the expenses of operating the company other than material, labor, 
and equipment. Overhead costs can be divided into two categories: (1) factory over-
head and (2) corporate overhead. Factory overhead consists of the costs of running 
the factory excluding materials, direct labor, and equipment. This overhead category 
includes plant supervision, maintenance, insurance, heat and light, and so forth. A 
worker who operates a piece of equipment may earn an hourly wage of $15/hr, but 
when fringe beneﬁ  ts and other overhead costs are ﬁ  gured in, the worker may cost 
the company $30/hr. Corporate overhead consists of company expenses not related 
to the factory, such as sales, marketing, accounting, legal, engineering, research and 
development, ofﬁ  ce space, utilities, and health beneﬁ  ts.3 These functions are required 
in the company, but they are not directly related to the cost of manufacturing. On the 
other hand, for pricing the product, they must be added in, or else the company will 
lose money on every product it sells. 
J Black [1] offers some estimates of the typical costs associated with manufac-
turing a product, presented in Figure 1.12. Several observations are worth making 
here. First, total manufacturing costs constitute only 40% of the product’s selling 
price. Corporate overhead expenses (Engineering, Research and development, 
Administration, sales, marketing, etc.) add up to almost as much as manufacturing 
cost. Second, parts and materials are 50% of total manufacturing cost, so that is 
about 20% of selling price. Third, direct labor is only about 12% of manufacturing 
cost, so that is less than 5% of selling price. Factory overhead, which includes the 
categories Plant and machinery, depreciation, energy at 26% and Indirect labor at 
12%, adds up to more than three times Direct labor cost.
The issue of overhead costs can become quite complicated. A more complete 
treatment can be found in [7] and most introductory accounting textbooks. Our 
approach in this book is simply to include an appropriate overhead expense in our 
labor and equipment cost rates. For example, the labor cost rate is 
 CL /H11005   RH ___ 60   (1 /H11001 RLOH) (1.7)
where CL /H11005 labor cost rate, $/min; RH /H11005 worker’s hourly wage rate, $/hr; and RLOH /H11005 
labor overhead rate, %.

3Health beneﬁ  ts, if available from the company, are fringe beneﬁ  ts that apply to all regular employees, 
and so they would be included in the direct labor overhead in the factory as well as the corporate ofﬁ  ces.

A production machine is purchased for an initial cost plus installation of 
$500,000. Its anticipated life /H11005 7 years. The machine is planned for a two-shift 
operation, eight hours per shift, and ﬁ  ve days per week. Assume 50 weeks per 
year. The applicable overhead rate on this type of equipment /H11005 35%. Deter-
mine the equipment cost rate.

COMPOSITES
Composites do not really constitute a separate category of materials; they are mix-
tures of the other three types. A composite  is a material consisting of two or more 
phases that are processed separately and then bonded together to achieve proper-
ties superior to those of its constituents. The term phase  refers to a homogeneous 
mass of material, such as an aggregation of grains of identical unit cell structure in a 
solid metal. The usual structure of a composite consists of particles or ﬁ  bers of one 
phase mixed in a second phase, called the matrix .
Composites are found in nature (e.g., wood), and they can be produced synthetically. 
The synthesized type is of greater interest here, and it includes glass ﬁ  bers in a polymer 
matrix, such as ﬁ  ber-reinforced plastic; polymer ﬁ  bers of one type in a matrix of a sec-
ond polymer, such as an epoxy-Kevlar composite; and ceramic in a metal matrix, such 
as a tungsten carbide in a cobalt binder to form a cemented carbide cutting tool.
Properties of a composite depend on its components, the physical shapes of the 
components, and the way they are combined to form the ﬁ  nal material. Some com-
posites combine high strength with light weight and are suited to applications such 
as aircraft components, car bodies, boat hulls, tennis rackets, and ﬁ  shing rods. Other 
composites are strong, hard, and capable of maintaining these properties at elevated 
temperatures, for example, cemented carbide cutting tools.

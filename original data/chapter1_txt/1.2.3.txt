POLYMERS
A polymer is a compound formed of repeating structural units called mers, whose 
 atoms share electrons to form very large molecules. Polymers usually consist of 
carbon plus one or more other elements such as hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and 
chlorine. Polymers are divided into three categories: (1) thermoplastic polymers, 
(2) thermosetting polymers, and (3) elastomers.

Thermoplastic polymers  can be subjected to multiple heating and cooling cycles 
without substantially altering the molecular structure of the polymer. Common 
thermoplastics include polyethylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, and nylon. 
Thermosetting polymers  chemically transform (cure) into a rigid structure upon 
cooling from a heated plastic condition; hence the name thermosetting. Members 
of this type include phenolics, amino resins, and epoxies. Although the name “ther-
mosetting” is used, some of these polymers cure by mechanisms other than heating. 
Elastomers  are polymers that exhibit signiﬁ  cant elastic behavior; hence the name 
elastomer. They include natural rubber, neoprene, silicone, and polyurethane.

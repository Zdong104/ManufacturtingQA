Production Systems
To operate effectively, a manufacturing ﬁ  rm must have systems that allow it to ef-
ﬁ ciently accomplish its type of production. Production systems consist of people, 
equipment, and procedures designed for the combination of materials and processes 
that constitute a ﬁ  rm’s manufacturing operations. Production systems can be divided 
into two categories: (1) production facilities and (2) manufacturing support systems, 
as shown in Figure 1.10.2 Production facilities  refer to the physical equipment and 
the arrangement of equipment in the factory. Manufacturing support  systems  are 1.4

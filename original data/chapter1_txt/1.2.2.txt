CERAMICS
A ceramic is deﬁ  ned as a compound containing metallic (or semimetallic) and nonme-
tallic elements. Typical nonmetallic elements are oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon. Ceram-
ics include a variety of traditional and modern materials. T raditional ceramics, some of 
which have been used for thousands of years, include: clay (abundantly available, con-
sisting of ﬁ  ne particles of hydrous aluminum silicates and other minerals used in mak-
ing brick, tile, and pottery); silica  (the basis for nearly all glass products); and alumina  
and silicon  carbide  (two abrasive materials used in grinding). Modern ceramics include 
some of the preceding materials, such as alumina, whose properties are enhanced in 
various ways through modern processing methods. Newer ceramics include: carbides —
metal carbides such as tungsten carbide and titanium carbide, which are widely used 
as cutting tool materials; and nitrides —metal and semimetal nitrides such as titanium 
nitride and boron nitride, used as cutting tools and grinding abrasives.
For processing purposes, ceramics can be divided into crystalline ceramics 
and glasses. Different methods of manufacturing are required for the two types. 
Crystalline ceramics are formed in various ways from powders and then ﬁ  red (heated 
to a temperature below the melting point to achieve bonding between the powders). 
The glass ceramics (namely, glass) can be melted and cast, and then formed in proc-
esses such as traditional glass blowing.

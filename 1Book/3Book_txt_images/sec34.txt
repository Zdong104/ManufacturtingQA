Integrated circuits constitute the brains of an electronic  system, but the complete system consists of much more  than packaged ICs. The ICs and other components are  mounted and interconnected on printed circuit boards,  which in turn are interconnected and contained in a  chassis or cabinet. Chip packaging (Section 33.6) is  only part of the total electronic package. This chapter  considers the remaining levels of packaging and how  the packages are manufactured and assembled.  

# Electronics  Packaging  

The electronics package is the physical means by which  the components in a system are electrically inter- connected and interfaced to external devices; it includes  the mechanical structure that holds and protects the  circuitry. A well-designed electronics package serves  the following functions: (1) power distribution and sig- nal interconnection, (2) structural support, (3) circuit  protection from physical and chemical hazards in the  environment, (4) dissipation of heat generated by the  circuits, and (5) minimum delays in signal transmission  within the system.  

For complex systems containing many components  and interconnections, the electronics package is organ- ized into levels that comprise a  packaging hierarchy ,  illus  trated in Figure 34.1 and summarized in Table 34.1.  The lowest level is the  zero level , which refers to the  intra connections on the semiconductor chip. The pack- aged chip (chip carrier), consisting of the IC in a plas- tic or ceramic enclosure and connected to the package  leads, constitutes the  ﬁ  rst level of packaging .  

Packaged chips and other components are assembled  to a printed circuit board (PCB) using two technologies  (Section 33.6.1): (1)  surface-mount technology  (SMT)

and (2)  through-hole technology , also known as  pin-in-hole  (PIH) technology. Today,  SMT is much more widely used in industry, especially for mass-produced products.  The chip package styles and assembly techniques are different for SMT and PIH. In  many cases, both assembly technologies are employed in the same board. Printed cir- cuit board assembly represents the  second level of packaging . Figure 34.2 shows two  PCB assemblies, illustrating both PIH and SMT types. Note the smaller component  sizes of the SMT board.

The assembled PCBs are, in turn, connected to a chassis or other framework; this  is the  third level of packaging . This third level may consist of a  rack  that holds the  boards, using wire cables to make the interconnections. In major electronic systems,  such as large computers, the PCBs are typically mounted onto a larger printed cir- cuit board called a  back plane , which has conduction paths to permit interconnec- tion between the smaller boards attached to it. This latter conﬁ  guration is known as  card-on-board  (COB) packaging, in which the smaller PCBs are called cards and  the back plane is the board.  

The  fourth level of packaging  consists of wiring and cabling inside the cabinet  that contains the electronic system. For systems of relatively low complexity, the  packaging may not include all of the possible levels in the hierarchy.  

A printed circuit board consists of one or more thin sheets of insulating material,  with thin copper lines on one or both surfaces that interconnect the components  attached to the board. In boards consisting of more than one layer, copper conduct- ing paths are interleaved between the layers. PCBs are used in packaged electronic  systems to hold components, provide electrical interconnections among them, and  make connections to external circuits. They have become standard building blocks  in virtually all electronic systems that contain packaged ICs and other components  (Historical Note 34.1). PCBs are so important and widely used because (1) they  provide a convenient structural platform for the components; (2) a board with cor- rectly routed interconnections can be mass produced consistently, without the varia- bility usually associated with hand wiring; (3) nearly all of the soldering connections  between components and the PCB can be accomplished in a one-step mechanized  

# Historical Note 34.1  Printed circuit boards  

Before printed circuit boards, electrical and electronic  components were manually fastened to a sheet-metal  chassis (usually aluminum) and then hand wired and  soldered to form the desired circuit. This was called  point-to-point construction. In the late 1950s, various  plastic boards became commercially available. These  boards, which provided electrical insulation, gradually  replaced the aluminum chassis.  The ﬁ  rst plastics were  phenolics, followed by glass-ﬁ  ber-reinforced epoxies.  The boards came with predrilled holes spaced at  standard intervals in both directions. This motivated  the use of electronic components that matched these  hole spacings.  The dual-in-line package evolved during  this period.  

The components in these circuit boards were hand- wired, which proved increasingly difﬁ  cult and prone to  human error as component densities increased and cir- cuits became more complex. The printed circuit board,  with etched copper foil on its surface to form the wiring  interconnections, was developed in the 1950s to solve  these problems with manual wiring. The printed circuit  boards during that period used through-hole technology,  and PCBs had to be drilled to accommodate the com- ponent leads. The original technique for “printing” the  circuit pattern onto the copper-clad board was screen  printing. In the late 1980s, surface mount technology  began to replace through-hole construction. SMT did  not require lead holes, and the components were signi- ﬁ  cantly smaller, allowing much higher circuit densities  to be achieved on the printed circuit boards. As track  widths became ﬁ  ner and ﬁ  ner, photolithography was  substituted for screen printing.  

Initial techniques to design the circuit masks involved  a manual inking procedure, in which the designer at- tempted to route the conducting tracks to provide the  required connections and avoid short circuits on a large  sheet of paper or vellum. This became more difﬁ  cult as  the number of components on the board increased and  the conducting lines interconnecting the components  became ﬁ  ner. Computer programs were developed to  aid the designer in solving the routing problem. How- ever, in many cases, it was impossible to ﬁ  nd a solu- tion with no intersecting tracks (short circuits). To solve  the problem, jumper wires were hand-soldered to the  board to make these connections. As the number of  jumper wires increased, the problem of human error  again appeared. Multilayer printed circuit boards were  introduced to deal with this routing issue.  

operation, (4) an assembled PCB gives reliable performance; and (5) in complex  electronic systems, each assembled PCB can be detached from the system for service,  repair, or replacement.  

# 34.2.1  STRUCTURES, TYPES, AND MATERIALS FOR PCBs  

A  printed circuit board  (PCB), also called a  printed wiring board  (PWB), is a  laminated ﬂ  at panel of insulating material designed to provide electrical intercon- nections between electronic components attached to it. Interconnections are made  by thin conducting paths on the surface of the board or in alternating layers sand- wiched between layers of insulating material. The conducting paths are made of  copper and are called  tracks . Other copper areas, called  lands , are also available  on the board surface for attaching and electrically connecting components.  

Insulation materials in PCBs are usually polymer composites reinforced with  glass fabrics or paper. Polymers include epoxy (most widely used), phenolic, and  polyimide. E-glass is the usual ﬁ  ber in glass-reinforcing fabrics, especially in epoxy  PCBs; cotton paper is a common reinforcing layer for phenolic boards. The usual  thickness of the substrate layer is 0.8 to  $3.2~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.031–0.125 in), and copper foil  thickness is around  $0.04~\mathrm{mm}$  (0.0015 in). The materials forming the PCB structure  must be electrically insulating, strong and rigid, resistant to warpage, dimensionally

stable, heat resistant, and ﬂ  ame retardant. Chemicals are often added to the polymer  composite to obtain the last two characteristics.  

There are three principal types of printed circuit board, shown in Figure 34.3:  (a)  single-sided  board, in which copper foil is only on one side of the insulation  substrate; (b)  double-sided  board, in which the copper foil is on both sides of the  substrate; and (c)  multilayer  board, consisting of alternating layers of conducting  foil and insulation. In all three structures, the insulation layers are constructed of  multiple laminates of epoxy-glass sheets (or other composite) bonded together to  form a strong and rigid structure. Multilayer boards are used for complex circuit  assemblies in which a large number of components must be interconnected with  many track routings, thus requiring more conducting paths than can be accommo- dated in one or two copper layers. Four layers is the most common multilayer con- ﬁ  guration, but boards with up to 24 conducting layers are produced.  

# 34.2.2  PRODUCTION OF THE STARTING BOARDS  

Single- and double-sided boards can be purchased from suppliers that specialize  in mass producing them in standard sizes. The boards are then custom-processed  by a circuit fabricator to create the speciﬁ  ed circuit pattern and board size for  a given application. Multilayer boards are fabricated from standard single- and  double-sided boards. The circuit fabricator processes the boards separately to  form the required circuit pattern for each layer in the ﬁ  nal structure, and then  the individual boards are bonded together with additional layers of epoxy-fabric.  Processing of multilayer boards is more involved and more expensive than the  other types; the reason for using them is that they provide better performance  for large systems than using a much greater number of lower-density boards of  simpler construction.  

The copper foil used to clad the starting boards is produced by a continuous  electro  forming process (Section 27.3.2), in which a rotating smooth metal drum is  partially submersed in an electrolytic bath containing copper ions. The drum is the  cathode in the circuit, causing the copper to plate onto its surface. As the drum rotates  out of the bath, the thin copper foil is peeled from its surface. The process is ideal for  producing the very thin copper foil needed for PCBs.  

Production of the starting boards consists of pressing multiple sheets of woven  glass ﬁ  ber that have been impregnated with partially cured epoxy (or other thermo- setting polymer). The number of sheets used in the starting sandwich determines the  thickness of the ﬁ  nal board. Copper foil is placed on one or both sides of the epoxy- glass laminated stack, depending on whether single- or double-sided boards are to  be made. For single-sided boards, a thin release ﬁ  lm is used on one side in place of  the copper foil to prevent sticking of the epoxy in the press. Pressing is accomplished  between two steam-heated platens of a hydraulic press. The combination of heat and  pressure compacts and cures the epoxy-glass layers to bond and harden the lami- nates into a single-piece board. The board is then cooled and trimmed to remove  excess epoxy that has been squeezed out around the edges.  

The completed board consists of a glass-fabric-reinforced epoxy panel, clad  with copper over its surface area on one or both sides. It is now ready for the cir- cuit fabricator. Panels are usually produced in large standard widths designed to  match the board handling systems on wave-soldering equipment, automatic inser- tion machines, and other PCB processing and assembly facilities. If the electronic  design calls for a smaller size, several units can be processed together on the same  larger board and then separated later.  

# 34.2.3  PROCESSES USED IN PCB FABRICATION  

The circuit fabricator employs a variety of processing operations to produce a ﬁ  nished  PCB, ready for assembly of components. The operations include cleaning, shearing,  hole drilling or punching, pattern imaging, etching, and electroless and electrolytic  plating. Most of these processes have been discussed in earlier chapters. This section  emphasizes the details that are relevant to PCB fabrication. The discussion proceeds  approximately in the order in which the processes are performed on a board. How- ever, there are differences in processing sequence between different board types,  and these differences are examined in Section 34.2.4. Some of the operations in PCB  fabrication must be performed under clean room conditions to avoid defects in the  printed circuits, especially for boards with ﬁ  ne tracks and details.  

Board Preparation  Initial preparation of the board consists of shearing, hole- making, and other shaping operations to create tabs, slots, and similar features in  the board. If necessary, the starting panel may have to be sheared to size for com- patibility with the circuit fabricator’s equipment. The holes, called tooling holes, are  made by drilling or punching and are used for positioning the board during subse- quent processing. The sequence of fabrication steps requires close alignment from  one process to the next, and these holes are used with locating pins at each operation  to achieve accurate registration. Three tooling holes per board are usually sufﬁ  cient  for this purpose; hole size is about $3.2\:\mathrm{mm}$  (0.125 in), larger than the circuit holes to  be drilled later.  

The board is typically bar coded for identiﬁ  cation purposes in this preparation  phase. Finally, a cleaning process is used to remove dirt and grease from the board  surface. Although cleanliness requirements are not as stringent as in IC fabrication,  small particles of dirt and dust can cause defects in the circuit pattern of a printed  circuit board; and surface ﬁ  lms of grease can inhibit etching and other chemical  processes. Cleanliness is essential for producing reliable PCBs.  

Hole Drilling   In addition to tooling holes, functional circuit holes are required  in PCBs as (1)  insertion holes  for inserting leads of components that are based on  through-hole technology, (2)  via holes , which are later copper-plated and used as  conducting paths from one side of the board to the other, and (3) holes to fasten  certain components such as heat sinks and connectors to the board. These holes  are either drilled or punched, using the tooling holes for location. Cleaner holes  can be produced by drilling, so most holes in PCB fabrication are drilled. A stack  of three or four panels may be drilled in the same operation, using a computer  numerically controlled (CNC) drill press that receives its programming instruc- tions from the design database. For high-production jobs, multiple-spindle drills  are sometimes used, permitting all of the holes in the board to be drilled in one  feed motion.  

Standard twist drills (Section 22.3.2) are used to drill the holes, but the application  makes a number of unusual demands on the drill and drilling equipment. Perhaps the  biggest single problem is the small hole size in printed circuit boards; drill diameter  is generally less than  $1.27\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.050 in), but some high-density boards require hole  sizes of  $0.15~\mathrm{mm}~(0.006~\mathrm{in})$  or even less [8]. Such small drill bits lack strength, and  their capacity to dissipate heat is low.  

Another difﬁ  culty is the unique work material. The drill bit must ﬁ  rst pass  through a thin copper foil and then proceed through an abrasive epoxy-glass com- posite. Different drills would normally be speciﬁ  ed for these materials, but a single  drill must sufﬁ  ce in PCB drilling. Cemented carbide or coated carbide are favored  over high speed steel as the tool material.  

The small hole size, combined with the stacking of several boards or multilayer  boards, result in a high depth-to-diameter ratio, aggravating the problem of chip  extraction from the hole. Other requirements placed on the operation include high  accuracy in hole location, smooth hole walls, and absence of burrs on the holes. Burrs  are usually formed when the drill enters or exits a hole; thin sheets of material are  often placed on top of and beneath the stack of boards to inhibit burr formation on  the boards themselves.  

Finally, any cutting tool must be used at a certain cutting speed to operate at best  efﬁ  ciency. For a drill bit, cutting speed is measured at the diameter. For very small  drill sizes, this means extremely high rotational speeds—up to  $100{,}000\ \mathrm{rev/min}$  in  some cases. Special spindle bearings and motors are required to achieve these speeds.  

Circuit Pattern Imaging and Etching   There are two basic methods by which  the circuit pattern is transferred to the copper surface of the board: screen printing  and photolithography. Both methods involve the use of a resist coating on the board  surface that determines where etching of the copper will occur to create the tracks  and lands of the circuit.  

Screen printing was the ﬁ  rst method used for PCBs. It is indeed a printing tech- nique, and the term  printed circuit board  can be traced to this method. In  screen print- ing , a stencil screen containing the circuit pattern is placed on the board, and liquid  resist is squeezed through the mesh to the surface beneath. This method is simple and  inexpensive, but its resolution is limited. It is normally used only for applications in  which track widths are greater than about  $0.25\:\mathrm{mm}$  (0.010 in).  

The second method of transferring the circuit pattern is  photolithography , in  which a light-sensitive resist material is exposed through a mask to transfer the cir- cuit pattern. The procedure is similar to the corresponding process in IC fabrication  (Section 33.3.1); some of the details in PCB processing will be described here.  

Photoresists used by circuit fabricators are available in two forms: liquid or  dry ﬁ  lm. Liquid resists can be applied by roller or spraying. Dry ﬁ  lm resists are  more commonly used in PCB fabrication. They consist of three layers: a ﬁ  lm  of photosensitive polymer sandwiched between a polyester support sheet on  one side and a removable plastic cover sheet on the other side. The cover sheet  prevents the photosensitive material from sticking during storage and handling.  Although more expensive than liquid resists, dry ﬁ  lm resists form coatings of  uniform thickness, and their processing in photolithography is simpler. To apply,  the cover sheet is removed, and the resist ﬁ  lm is placed on the copper surface to  which it readily adheres. Hot rollers are used to press and smooth the resist onto  the surface.  

Alignment of the masks relative to the board relies on the use of registration  holes that are aligned with the tooling holes on the board. Contact printing is used  to expose the resist beneath the mask. The resist is then developed, which involves  removal of the unexposed regions of the negative resist from the surface.  

After resist development, certain areas of the copper surface remain covered by  resist while other areas are now unprotected. The covered areas correspond to cir- cuit tracks and lands, while uncovered areas correspond to open regions between.  Etching  removes the copper cladding in the unprotected regions from the board  surface, usually by means of a chemical etchant. Etching is the step that transforms  the solid copper ﬁ  lm into the interconnections for an electrical circuit.  

Etching is done in an etching chamber in which the etchant is sprayed onto the  surface of the board that is now partially coated with resist. Various etchants are  used to remove copper, including ammonium persulfate  $\mathrm{((NH_{4})_{2}S_{2}O_{4})}$ , ammonium  hydroxide  $\mathrm{(NH_{4}O H)}$ , cupric chloride  $\left(\operatorname{CuCl}_{2}\right)$ , and ferric chloride  $\left(\mathrm{{FeCl}}_{3}\right)$ . Each has  its relative advantages and disadvantages. Process parameters (e.g., temperature,  etchant concentration, and duration) must be closely controlled to avoid over- or  under-etching, as in IC fabrication. After etching, the board must be rinsed and the  remaining resist chemically stripped from the surface.  

Plating   In printed circuit boards, plating is needed on the hole surfaces to provide  conductive paths from one side to the other in double-sided boards, or between layers  in multilayer boards. Two types of plating process are used in PCB fabrication: electro- plating and electroless plating (Section 27.3). Electroplating has a higher deposition  rate than electroless plating but requires that the coated surface be metallic (conduc- tive). Electroless plating is slower but does not require a conductive surface.  

After drilling of the via holes and insertion holes, the walls of the holes consist  of epoxy-glass insulation material, which is nonconductive. Accordingly, electroless  plating must be used initially to provide a thin coating of copper on the hole walls.  Once the thin ﬁ  lm of copper has been applied, electrolytic plating is then used to  increase coating thickness on the hole surfaces to between 0.025 and $0.05\,\mathrm{mm}$  (0.001  and 0.002 in).  

Gold is another metal sometimes plated onto printed circuit boards. It is used as  a very thin coating on PCB edge connectors to provide superior electrical contact.  Coating thickness is only about $2.5\;\mu\mathrm{m}$  (0.0001 in).

# 34.2.4  PCB FABRICATION SEQUENCE  

This section describes the processing sequence for various board types. The sequence  is concerned with transforming a copper-clad board of reinforced polymer into a  printed circuit board, a procedure called  circuitization . The desired result is illus- trated in Figure 34.4 for a double-sided board.  

Circuitization   Three methods of circuitization can be used to determine which  regions of the board will be coated with copper [13]: (1) subtractive, (2) additive, and  (3) semiadditive.  

In the  subtractive method , open portions of the copper cladding on the starting  board are etched away from the surface, so that the tracks and lands of the desired  circuit remain. The process is called “subtractive” because copper is removed from  the board surface. The steps in the subtractive method are described in Figure 34.5.  

The  additive method  starts with a board surface that is not copper clad, such  as the uncoated surface of a single-sided board. However, the uncoated surface is  treated with a chemical, called a  buttercoat , which acts as the catalyst for electroless  plating. The steps in the method are outlined in Figure 34.6.  

![](images/6958a2436a97f5f3ff025d61df5952517311d7a914662f6cb54ab13db88ef7aa.jpg)  
FIGURE 34.5  The  subtractive method of  circuitization in PCB  fabrication: (1) apply  resist to areas not to be  etched, using photo- lithography to expose  the areas that are to be  etched, (2) etch, and  (3) strip resist.

FIGURE 34.6  The additive method of circuitization in PCB fabrication: (1) a resist ﬁ  lm is applied to the surface using  photolithography to expose the areas to be copper plated; (2) the exposed surface is chemically activated to serve as  a catalyst for electroless plating; (3) copper is plated on exposed areas; and (4) resist is stripped.  

The  semiadditive method  uses a combination of additive and subtractive steps.  The starting board has a very thin copper ﬁ  lm on its surface $-5\;\mu\mathrm{m}$ (0.0002 in) or  less. The method proceeds as described in Figure 34.7.  

Processing of Different Board Types   Processing methods differ for the three  PCB types: single-sided, double-sided, and multilayer. A  single-sided board  begins  

![](images/c36240c0fb623e8124aef1e12dc7bf351608b1be1067d81ade54993bbd349d03.jpg)

fabrication as a ﬂ  at sheet of insulating material clad on one side with copper ﬁ  lm.  The subtractive method is used to produce the circuit pattern in the copper cladding.  

A  double-sided board  involves a somewhat more complex processing sequence  because it has circuit tracks on both sides that must be electrically connected.  The interconnection is accomplished by means of copper-plated via holes that run  from lands on one surface of the board to lands on the opposite surface, as shown  in Figure 34.4. A typical fabrication sequence for a double-sided board (copper- clad on both sides) uses the semiadditive method. After hole drilling, electroless  plating is used to initially plate the holes, followed by electroplating to increase  plating thickness.  

A  multilayer board  is structurally the most complex of the three types, and this  complexity is reﬂ  ected in its manufacturing sequence. The laminated construction can  be seen in Figure 34.8, which highlights some of the features of a multilayer PCB.  The fabrication steps for the individual layers are basically the same as those used  for single- and double-sided boards. What makes multilayer board fabrication more  complicated is that (1) all of the layers, each with its own circuit design, must ﬁ  rst be  processed; then (2) the layers must be joined together to form one integral board; and  ﬁ  nally (3) the assembled board must itself be put through its own processing sequence.  

A multilayer board consists of  logic layers , which carry electrical signals between  components on the board, and  voltage layers , which are used to distribute power.  Logic layers are generally fabricated from double-sided boards, whereas voltage  layers are usually made from single-sided boards. Thinner insulating substrates  are used for multi  layer boards than for their standalone single- and double-sided  counter  parts, so that a suitable thickness of the ﬁ  nal board can be achieved.  

In the second stage, the individual layers are assembled together. The procedure  starts with copper foil on the bottom outside, and then adds the individual layers,  separating one from the next by one or more sheets of glass fabric impregnated with  partially cured epoxy. After all layers have been sandwiched together, a ﬁ  nal copper  foil is placed on the stack to form the top outer layer. Layers are then bonded into a  single board by heating the assembly under pressure to cure the epoxy. After curing,  any excess resin squeezed out of the sandwich around the edges is trimmed away.  

At the start of the third stage of fabrication, the board consists of multiple layers  bonded together, with copper foil cladded on its outer surfaces. Its construction can  therefore be likened to that of a double-sided board; and its processing is likewise  similar. The sequence consists of drilling additional through-holes, plating the holes  to establish conduction paths between the two exterior copper ﬁ  lms as well as cer- tain internal copper layers, and the use of photolithography and etching to form the  circuit pattern on the outer copper surfaces.  

Testing and Finishing Operations  After a circuit has been fabricated on the  board surface, it must be inspected and tested to ensure that it functions according  to design speciﬁ  cations and contains no quality defects. Two procedures are com- mon: (1) visual inspection and (2) continuity testing. In  visual inspection , the board  is examined visually to detect open and short circuits, errors in drilled hole loca- tions, and other faults that can be observed without applying electrical power to the  board. Visual inspections, performed not only after fabrication but also at various  critical stages during production, are accomplished by human eye or machine vision  (Section 40.6.3).  

Continuity testing  involves the use of contact probes brought simultaneously into  contact with track and land areas on the board surface. The setup consists of an array  of probes that are forced under light pressure to make contact with speciﬁ  ed points  on the board surface. Electrical connections between contact points can be quickly  checked in this procedure.  

Several additional processing steps must be performed on the bare board to pre- pare it for assembly. The ﬁ  rst of these ﬁ  nishing operations is the application of a thin  solder layer on the track and land surfaces. This layer serves to protect the copper  from oxidation and contamination. It is carried out either by electroplating or by  bringing the copper side into contact with rotating rollers that are partially sub- mersed in molten solder.  

A second operation involves application of a coating of solder resist to all areas of  the board surface except the lands that are to be subsequently soldered in assembly.  The solder resist coating is chemically formulated to resist adhesion of solder; thus,  in the subsequent soldering processes, solder adheres only to land areas. Solder resist  is usually applied by screen printing.  

Finally, an identiﬁ  cation legend is printed onto the surface, again by screen print- ing. The legend indicates where the different components are to be placed on the  board in ﬁ  nal assembly. In modern industrial practice, a bar code is also printed on  the board for production control purposes.  

#  Printed Circuit Board Assembly  

A printed circuit board assembly consists of electronic components (e.g., IC pack- ages, resistors, capacitors) as well as mechanical components (e.g., fasteners, heat  sinks) mounted on a printed circuit board. This is level 2 in electronic packaging  (Table 34.1). As indicated, PCB assembly is based on either surface-mount techno- logy (SMT) or through-hole technology (see Figure 34.2). Some PCB assemblies  include both SMT and through-hole components. The discussion in this section  covers both categories as well as combinations of the two. The scope of electronic  assembly also includes higher packaging levels such as assemblies of multiple  PCBs electrically connected and mechanically contained in a chassis or cabinet.  Section 34.4 explores the technologies by which electrical connections are made at  these higher levels.  

# 34.3.1  SURFACE MOUNT TECHNOLOGY  

Since the late 1980s, the use of surface mount technology has grown to the point  where it is now the dominant process in printed circuit board assembly. The earlier  through-hole technology has the following inherent limitations in terms of packing  density: (1) components can be mounted on only one side of the board, and (2) center- to-center distance between lead pins in leaded components must be a minimum of  $1.0\:\mathrm{mm}\:(0.04\:\mathrm{in})$  and is usually $2.5\,\mathrm{mm}\,(0.10\,\mathrm{in})$ .  

Surface-mount technology uses an assembly method in which component leads  are soldered to lands on the surface of the board rather than into holes running  through the board (Historical Note 34.2). By eliminating the need for leads inserted  into through holes in the board, several advantages are gained: (1) smaller compo- nents are available, with leads closer together; (2) circuit densities can be increased;  (3) components can be mounted on both sides of the board; (4) smaller PCBs can be  used for the same electronic system; and (5) drilling of the many through holes dur- ing board fabrication is eliminated although via holes to interconnect layers are still  required [6]. Typical areas on the board surface taken by SMT components range  between $20\%$  and $60\%$  compared to through-hole components.  

# Historical Note 34.2  Surface-mount technology  

Printed circuit board assemblies based on through- hole technology were the predominant electronics  packaging method from the 1950s through most of the  1980s, when surface-mount technology (SMT) started  to be widely used.  

SMT traces its origins to the electronic systems  in the aerospace and military industries of the 1960s,  with the IBM Corporation responsible for much of  the original development work. The ﬁ  rst components  were small, ﬂ  at ceramic packages with gull-wing  leads. The initial reason why these packages were  attrac  tive, compared with through-hole technology,  was the fact that they could be placed on both sides  of a printed circuit board—in effect, doubling the com- ponent density. In addition, the SMT package could be  made smaller than a comparable through-hole pack- age, further increasing component densities on the  printed circuit board.  

In the early 1970s, further advances in SMT were  made in the form of leadless components—components  with ceramic packages that had no discrete leads. This  permitted even greater circuit densities in military and  aerospace electronics. In the late 1970s, plastic SMT  packages became available, motivating the widespread  use of surface-mount technology. The computer and  automotive industries have become important users of  SMT , and their demand for SMT components has con- tributed to the signiﬁ  cant growth in this technology.  

Despite its advantages, SMT has not been fully adopted by the electronics industry to  the exclusion of through-hole technology. There are several reasons for this: (1) Owing  to their smaller size, surface mount components are more difﬁ  cult to handle and assem- ble by humans; (2) inspection, testing, and rework of the circuit assemblies are gener- ally more difﬁ  cult in SMT because of the smaller scale involved; and (3) certain types  of components are not available in surface-mount form. This ﬁ  nal limitation results in  some electronic assemblies that contain both surface-mount and leaded components.  

The sequence of steps to produce assembled PCBs is basically the same in SMT and  through-hole technology: (1) place the components on the PCB, (2) solder the compo- nents to the PCB lands, (3) clean the assembly, (4) inspect, (5) test, and (6) rework. The  details of the ﬁ  rst two steps differ for SMT and through-hole technology. The ﬁ  nal four  steps are the same, except that the smaller scale of SMT makes inspection, testing, and  rework more challenging.  

Component placement in SMT means correctly locating the component on the  PCB and afﬁ  xing it sufﬁ  ciently to the surface until soldering provides permanent  mechanical and electrical connections. Two alternative placement and soldering

FIGURE 34.9  Solder paste and reﬂ  ow method: (1) apply solder paste to desired land areas, (2) place components  onto board, (3) bake paste, and (4) solder reﬂ  ow.  

methods are available: (1) solder paste and reﬂ  ow soldering, and (2) adhesive bond- ing of components and wave soldering. It turns out that certain types of SMT compo- nents are more suited to one method whereas other types are more suited to the  other method.  

Solder Paste and Reﬂ  ow Soldering   The steps in this method are described in  Figure 34.9. A solder paste is used to afﬁ  x components to the surface of the circuit  board. A  solder paste  is a suspension of solder powders in a ﬂ  ux binder. It has three  functions: (1) it is the solder—typically $80\%$  to $90\%$  of total paste volume, (2) it is  the ﬂ  ux, and (3) it is the adhesive that temporarily secures the components to the  surface of the board. Methods of applying the solder paste to the board surface  include screen printing and syringe dispensing. Properties of the paste must be com- patible with these application methods; the paste must ﬂ  ow yet not be so liquid that  it spreads beyond the localized area where it is applied.  

After solder paste application, the components are placed onto the board surface  by automated placement machines or semiautomatic placement machines. The auto- matic machines operate under computer numerical control (Section 37.3). Compo- nents (e.g., chip carriers, capacitors, resistors) to be placed are usually supplied in  magazines or attached to tape in reels that can be loaded into feeders on the auto- mated machines. The starting blank PCB is moved and positioned under the pick- and-place work head that places the components at speciﬁ  ed locations on the board  using a high-speed  $x$ - y  positioning system. The work head uses suction nozzles to  retrieve and handle components. Automated machines operate at cycle rates of up  to 30,000 components per hour [20]. For mass production, they are frequently inte- grated into production lines, so that most or all of the processes performed on the  board during assembly are completed in one automated sequence.  

The semiautomatic machines assist a worker in the placement operation using a  high-resolution vision system. Components to be placed are presented to the opera- tor in the correct placement sequence by a turret mechanism, and then the operator  picks the component and is guided by the vision monitor to place it at the target

location on the board. Cycle rates of 1,000 components per hour are claimed for  some semiautomatic machines [15].  

After all components are placed on the board, a low-temperature baking opera- tion is performed to dry the ﬂ  ux binder; this reduces gas escape during soldering.  Finally, the solder reﬂ  ow process (Section 30.2.3) heats the solder paste sufﬁ  ciently  that the solder particles melt to form a high-quality mechanical and electrical joint  between the component leads and the circuit lands on the board.  

Adhesive Bonding and Wave Soldering  The sequence of steps is depicted in  Figure 34.10. Various adhesives (Section 30.3) are used for afﬁ  xing components to  the board surface. Most common are epoxies and acrylics. The adhesive is applied by  one of three methods: (1) brushing liquid adhesive through a screen stencil; (2) using  an automatic dispensing machine with a programmable  $x$ - y  positioning system; or  (3) using a pin transfer method, in which a ﬁ  xture consisting of pins arranged accord- ing to where adhesive must be applied is dipped into the liquid adhesive and then  positioned onto the board surface to deposit adhesive in the required spots.  

Components are placed on the board by the same type of placement machines used  with the solder paste assembly method. After component placement, the adhesive  is cured. Depending on adhesive type, curing is by heat, ultraviolet (UV) light, or a  combination of UV and infrared (IR) radiation. With the surface-mount components  now bonded to the PCB surface, the board is put through wave soldering. The compo- nents themselves pass through the molten solder wave. Technical problems sometimes  encountered in SMT wave soldering include components uprooted from the board,  components shifting position, and larger components creating shadows that inhibit  proper soldering of neighboring components.  

# 34.3.2  THROUGH-HOLE TECHNOLOGY  

In printed circuit assemblies using through-hole technology, the lead pins must be  inserted into through-holes in the circuit board. Once inserted, the leads are soldered  into place in the holes in the board. In double-sided and multilayer boards, the hole  surfaces into which the leads are inserted are generally copper plated, giving rise to  the name  plated through-hole  for these cases. After soldering, the boards are cleaned  and tested, and those boards not passing the test are reworked if possible.  

Component Insertion  In component insertion, the leads of components are  inserted into their proper through-holes in the PCB. In PCB assemblies based  exclusively on through-hole technology (unusual today), a single board may be  populated with hundreds of separate components (DIPs, resistors, etc.), all of  which need to be inserted into the board. In modern electronic assembly plants,  most component insertions are accomplished by automatic insertion machines.  Components are loaded into these machines in the form of reels, magazines, or  other carriers that maintain proper orientation of the components until insertion.  A small proportion is done by hand for nonstandard components that cannot  be accommodated on automatic machines. These cases include switches and con- nectors as well as resistors, capacitors, and certain other components. Although  the proportion of component insertions accomplished manually is low, their cost  is high because of much lower cycle rates than automatic insertions. Industrial  robots (Section 37.4) are sometimes used to substitute for human labor in these  component insertion tasks.  

The insertion operation involves (1) preforming the leads, (2) insertion of leads  into the board holes, and then (3) cropping and clinching the leads on the other side  of the board. Preforming is needed only for some component types and involves  bending of leads that are initially straight into a U-shape for insertion. Many compo- nents come with properly shaped leads and require little or no preforming.  

Insertion is accomplished by a work head designed for the component type.  Components inserted by automatic machines are grouped into three basic  catego  ries: (a) axial lead, (b) radial lead, and (c) chip carrier (e.g., dual-in-line  package, Section 33.6.1). Typical axial and radial lead components are pictured  in Figure 34.11. Axial components are shaped like a cylinder, with leads project- ing from each end. Typical components of this type include resistors, capacitors,  and diodes. Their leads must be bent, as suggested in the ﬁ  gure, to be inserted.  Radial components have parallel leads and have various body shapes, one of  which is shown in Figure 34.11(b). This type of component includes light-emitting  diodes, potentiometers, resistor networks, and fuse holders. These conﬁ  gurations  are sufﬁ    ciently different that separate insertion machines with the appropriate

FIGURE 34.11  Two of  the three basic  component types used  with automatic insertion  machines: (a) axial lead  and (b) radial lead. The  third type, dual-in-line  package (DIP), is  illustrated in Figure 33.20.

FIGURE 34.12  Clinching and cropping  of component leads:  (1) as inserted, and  (2) after bending and  cutting; leads can be  bent either (a) inward  or (b) outward.  

work head designs must be used to handle each category. Accurate positioning of  the board beneath the work head before each insertion is performed by a high- speed $x{-}y$  positioning table.  

Once the leads have been inserted through the holes in the board, they are  clinched and cropped. Clinching involves bending the leads, as in Figure 34.12, to  mechanically secure the component to the board until soldering. If this were not  done, the component is at risk of being knocked out of its holes during handling. In  cropping, the leads are cut to proper length; otherwise, there is a possibility that they  might become bent and cause a short circuit with nearby circuit tracks or compo- nents. These operations are performed automatically on the underside of the board  by the insertion machine.  

The three types of insertion machines, corresponding to the three basic com- ponent conﬁ  gurations, can be joined to form an integrated circuit board assembly  line. The integration is accomplished by means of a conveyor system that transfers  boards from one machine type to the next. A computer control system is used to  track the progress of each board as it moves through the cell and download the  correct programs to each workstation.  

Soldering   The second basic step in PCB assembly is soldering. For inserted compo- nents, the most important soldering techniques are wave soldering and hand solder- ing. These methods as well as other aspects of soldering are discussed in Section 30.2.  

Wave soldering is a mechanized technique in which printed circuit boards contain- ing inserted components are moved by conveyor over a standing wave of molten  solder (Figure 30.9). The position of the conveyor is such that only the underside  of the board, with component leads projecting through the holes, is in contact with  the solder. The combination of capillary action and the upward force of the wave  cause the liquid solder to ﬂ  ow into the clearances between leads and through-holes to  obtain a good solder joint. The tremendous advantage of wave soldering is that all of  the solder joints on a board are made in a single pass through the process.  

Hand soldering involves a skilled operator using a soldering iron to make circuit  connections. Compared with wave soldering, hand soldering is slow since solder joints  are made one at a time. As a production method, it is generally used only for small lot  production and rework. As with other manual tasks, human error can result in quality  problems. Hand soldering is sometimes used after wave soldering to add delicate  components that would be damaged in the harsh environment of the wave-soldering  chamber. Manual soldering has certain advantages in PCB assembly that should be  noted: (1) Heat is localized and can be directed at a small target area; (2) equipment is  inexpensive compared with wave soldering; and (3) energy consumption is consider- ably less.

FIGURE 34.13  Typical  process sequence for  combined SMT-PIH  assemblies with com- ponents on same side of  board: (1) apply solder  paste on lands for SMT  components, (2) place  SMT components on the  board, (3) bake, (4) reﬂ  ow  solder, (5) insert PIH  components, and (6)  wave solder PIH com- ponents. This would be  followed by cleaning,  testing, and rework.  

# 34.3.3  COMBINED SMT-PIH ASSEMBLY  

The preceding discussion of SMT assembly methods assumed a relatively simple  circuit board with SMT components on only one side. These cases are unusual  because most SMT circuit assemblies combine surface-mounted and pin-in-hole  components on the same board. In addition, SMT assemblies can be populated on  both sides of the board, whereas PIH components are normally limited to one side  only. The assembly sequence must be altered to allow for these additional possibili- ties, although the basic processing steps described in the two preceding sections are  the same.  

One possibility is for the SMT and through-hole components to be on the same  side of the board. For this case, a typical sequence would consist of the steps described  in Figure 34.13. More complex PCB assemblies consist of SMT-PIH components as in  the ﬁ  gure, but with SMT components on both sides of the board.  

# 34.3.4  CLEANING, INSPECTION, TESTING, AND REWORK  

After the components have been connected to the board, the assembly must be  cleaned, inspected for solder faults, circuit tested, and reworked if necessary.  

Cleaning  After soldering, contaminants are present on the printed circuit assem- bly. These foreign substances include ﬂ  ux, oil and grease, salts, and dirt, some of  which can cause chemical degradation of the assembly or interfere with its elec- tronic functions. One or more chemical cleaning operations (Section 27.1.1) must be  performed to remove these undesirable materials. Traditional cleaning methods for  PCB assemblies include hand cleaning with appropriate solvents and vapor degreas- ing with chlorinated solvents. Concern over environmental hazards in recent years  has motivated the search for effective water-based solvents to replace the chlorin- ated and ﬂ  uorinated chemicals traditionally used in vapor degreasing.  

Inspection  After cleaning, the PCB assembly is inspected for defective solder  joints. Inspection of soldering quality is somewhat more difﬁ  cult for surface-mount  circuits (SMCs) because these assemblies are generally more densely packed, the  solder joints are smaller, and joint geometries are different from those in through- hole assemblies. One of the problems is the way surface mount components are held  in place during soldering. In through-hole assembly, the components are mechani- cally fastened in place by clinched leads. In SMT assembly, components are held by  solder paste or adhesive. At soldering temperatures this method of attachment is not  as secure, and components sometimes shift. Another problem with the smaller sizes  in SMT is a greater likelihood of solder bridges forming between adjacent leads,  resulting in short circuits.  

Visual inspection is used to detect for board substrate damage, missing or damaged  components, soldering faults, and similar quality defects that can be observed by eye.  Machine vision systems are being used to perform these inspections automatically in  a growing number of installations.  

Testing  Test procedures must be performed on the completed assembly to verify  its functionality. The board design must allow for this testing by including test points  in the circuit layout. These test points are convenient locations in the circuit where  probes can make contact for testing. Individual components in the circuit are tested  by contacting the component leads, applying input test signals, and measuring the  output signals. More sophisticated procedures include digital function tests, in which  the entire circuit or major subcircuits are tested using a programmed sequence of  input signals and measuring the corresponding output signals to simulate operating  conditions.  

Another test used for printed circuit board assemblies is the substitution test,  in which a production unit is plugged into a mock-up of the working system and  energized to perform its functions. If the assembly performs in a satisfactory way, it  is deemed as passing the test. It is then unplugged, and the next production unit is  substituted in the mock-up.  

Finally, a burn-in test is performed on certain types of PCB assemblies that may  be subject to “infant mortality.” Some boards contain defects that are not revealed in  normal functional tests but which are likely to cause failure of the circuit during early  service. Burn-in tests operate the assemblies under power for a certain period of time,  such as 24 or 72 hours, sometimes at elevated temperatures, such as $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(100^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ , to  force these defects to manifest their failures during the testing period. Boards not  subject to infant mortality will survive this test and provide long service life.  

The smaller scale of SMT poses problems in circuit testing because less space is  available around each component. Contact probes must be physically smaller and  more probes are required because SMT assemblies are more densely populated.  One way of dealing with this issue is to design the circuit layout with extra lands  whose only purpose is to provide a test probe contact site. Unfortunately, including  these test lands runs counter to the goal of achieving higher packing densities on the  SMT board.  

Rework  When inspection and testing indicate that one or more components on  the board are defective, or certain solder joints are faulty, it usually makes sense  to try to repair the assembly rather than discard it together with all of the other  components that are not defective. This repair step is an integral part of electronic  assembly plant operations. Common rework tasks include touchup (repair of solder  faults), replacement of defective or missing components, and repair of copper ﬁ  lm  that has lifted from the substrate surface. These tasks are manual operations, requir- ing skilled workers using soldering irons. Rework of surface-mount assemblies is  more difﬁ  cult than in conventional PIH assemblies, again because of the smaller  component sizes. Special tools are required, such as small-bit soldering irons, magni- fying devices, and instruments for grasping and manipulating the small parts.  

#  Electrical Connector Technology  

PCB assemblies must be connected to back planes, and into racks and cabinets, and  these cabinets must be connected to other cabinets and systems by means of cables.  The growing use of electronics in so many types of products has made electrical  connections an important technology. The performance of any electronic system  depends on the reliability of the individual connections linking the components of  the system together. This section is concerned with connector technology that is  usually applied at the third and higher levels of electronics packaging.  

To begin, there are two basic methods of making electrical connections: (1) solder- ing and (2) pressure connections. Soldering was discussed in Section 30.2 and through- out the current chapter. It is the most widely used technology in electronics.  Pressure  connections  are electrical connections in which mechanical forces are used to estab- lish electrical continuity between components. They can be divided into two types:  permanent and separable.  

# 34.4.1  PERMANENT CONNECTIONS  

A permanent connection involves high-pressure contact between two metal sur- faces, in which one or both parts are mechanically deformed during the assembly  process. Permanent connection methods include crimping, press ﬁ  t technology, and  insulation displacement.  

Crimping of Connector Terminals  This connection method is used to assemble  wire to electrical terminals. Although assembly of the wire to the terminal forms a  permanent joint, the terminal itself is designed to be connected and disconnected  to its mating component. There are a variety of terminal styles, some of which are  shown in Figure 34.14, and they are available in various sizes. They all must be con- nected to conductor wire, and crimping is the operation for doing this.  Crimping involves the mechanical deformation of the terminal barrel to form a permanent  connection with the stripped end of a wire inserted into it. The crimping operation  squeezes and closes the barrel around the bare wire. Crimping is performed by hand  tools or crimping machines. The terminals are supplied either as individual pieces or  on long strips that can be fed into a crimping machine. Properly accomplished, the  crimped joint will have low electrical resistance and high mechanical strength.

FIGURE 34.15  Two types of  terminal pins in electronics  press ﬁ  t technology: (a) solid  and (b) compliant.  

Press Fit Technology  Press ﬁ  t in electrical connections is similar to that in mechani- cal assembly, but the part conﬁ  gurations are different. Press ﬁ  t technology is widely  used in the electronics industry to assemble terminal pins into metal-plated through- holes in large PCBs. In that context, a  press ﬁ  t  involves an interference ﬁ  t between  the terminal pin and the plated hole into which it has been inserted. There are two  categories of terminal pins: (a) solid and (b) compliant, as in Figure 34.15. Within these  categories, pin designs vary among suppliers. The solid pin is rectangular in cross sec- tion and is designed so that its corners press and even cut into the metal of the plated  hole to form a good electrical connection. The compliant pin is designed as a spring- loaded device that conforms to the hole contour but presses against the walls of the  hole to achieve electrical contact.  

Insulation Displacement   Insulation displacement is a method of making a perma- nent electrical connection in which a sharp, prong-shaped contact pierces the insulation  and squeezes against the wire conductor to form an electrical connection. The method  is illustrated in Figure 34.16 and is commonly used to make simultaneous connections  between multiple contacts and ﬂ  at cable. The ﬂ  at cable, called  ribbon cable , consists of  a number of parallel wires held in a ﬁ  xed arrangement by the insula  tion surrounding  them. It is often terminated in multiple pin connectors that are widely used in elec- tronics to make electrical connections between major subassemblies. In these applica- tions, the insulation displacement method reduces wiring errors and speeds harness  assembly. To make the assembly, the cable is placed in a nest and a press is used to drive  the connector contacts through the insulation and against the metal wires.

# 34.4.2  SEPARABLE CONNECTORS  

Separable connections are designed to permit disassembly and reassembly; they are  meant to be connected and disconnected multiple times. When connected they must  provide metal-to-metal contact between mating components with high reliability and  low electrical resistance. Separable connection devices typically consist of multiple  contacts, contained in a plastic molded housing, designed to mate with a compatible  connector or individual wires or terminals. They are used for making electrical connec- tions between various combinations of cables, printed circuit boards, components, and  individual wires.  

A wide selection of connectors is available to serve many different applications.  The design issues in choosing among them include (1) power level (e.g., whether the  connector is used for power or signal transmission); (2) cost; (3) number of individual  conductors involved; (4) types of devices and circuits to be connected; (5) space limita- tions; (6) ease of joining the connector to its leads; (7) ease of connecting with the mat- ing terminal or connector; and (8) frequency of connection and disconnection. Some  of the principal connector types are cable connectors, terminal blocks, sockets, and  connectors with low or zero insertion force.  

Cable connectors  are devices that are permanently connected to cables (one or  both ends) and are designed to be plugged into and unplugged from a mating con- nector. A power cord connector that plugs into a wall receptacle is a familiar example.  Other styles include the type of multiple pin connector and mating receptacle shown  in Figure 34.17, used to provide signal transmission between electronic subassem- blies. Other multiple pin connector styles are used to attach printed circuit boards to  other subassemblies in the electronic system.  

Terminal blocks  consist of a series of evenly spaced receptacles that allow connec- tions between individual terminals or wires. The terminals or wires are often attached  to the block by means of screws or other mechanical fastening mechanisms to permit  disassembly. A conventional terminal block is illustrated in Figure 34.18.  

A  socket  in electronics refers to a connection device mounted to a PCB, into  which IC packages and other components can be inserted. Sockets are permanently  attached to the PCB by soldering and/or press ﬁ  tting, but they provide a separable  connection method for the components, which can be conveniently added, removed,  or replaced in the PCB assembly. Sockets are therefore an alternative to soldering  in electronics packaging.

# Mechanical  Properties of  Materials  

3  

Mechanical properties of a material determine its be- havior when subjected to mechanical stresses. These  properties include elastic modulus, ductility, hardness,  and various measures of strength. Mechanical proper- ties are important in design because the function and  performance of a product depend on its capacity to re- sist deformation under the stresses encountered in serv- ice. In design, the usual objective is for the product and  its components to withstand these stresses without sig- niﬁ  cant change in geometry. This capability depends on  properties such as elastic modulus and yield strength. In  manufacturing, the objective is just the opposite. Here,  stresses that exceed the yield strength of the material  must be applied to alter its shape. Mechanical processes  such as forming and machining succeed by developing  forces that exceed the material’s resistance to deforma- tion. Thus, there is the following dilemma: Mechanical  properties that are desirable to the designer, such as high  strength, usually make the manufacture of the product  more difﬁ  cult. It is helpful for the manufacturing engi- neer to appreciate the design viewpoint and for the de- signer to be aware of the manufacturing viewpoint.

# Stress–Strain  Relationships  

There are three types of static stresses to which mate- rials can be subjected: tensile, compressive, and shear.  Tensile stresses tend to stretch the material, compres- sive stresses tend to squeeze it, and shear involves  stresses that tend to cause adjacent portions of the ma- terial to slide against each other. The stress–strain curve  is the basic relationship that describes the mechanical  properties of materials for all three types.

# 3.1.1 TENSILE PROPERTIES  

The tensile test is the most common procedure for studying the stress–strain rela- tionship, particularly for metals. In the test, a force is applied that pulls the material,  tending to elongate it and reduce its diameter, as shown in Figure 3.1(a). Standards  by ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) specify the preparation of  the test specimen and the conduct of the test itself. The typical specimen and general  setup of the tensile test is illustrated in Figure 3.1(b) and (c), respectively.  

The starting test specimen has an original length  $L_{o}$  and area  $A_{o}$ . The length is  measured as the distance between the gage marks, and the area is measured as  the (usually round) cross section of the specimen. During the testing of a metal,  the specimen stretches, then necks, and ﬁ  nally fractures, as shown in Figure 3.2.  

![](images/d9e12c60253897fff622ef840f4c9f7918425434d2680004cdc9b82d613eb271.jpg)

If pieces are  put back together as in  (6), ﬁ  nal length can be  measured.  

The load and the change in length of the specimen are recorded as testing proceeds,  to provide the data required to determine the stress–strain relationship. There are  two different types of stress–strain curves: (1) engineering stress–strain and (2) true  stress–strain. The ﬁ  rst is more important in design, and the second is more important  in manufacturing.  

Engineering Stress–strain   The engineering stress and strain in a tensile test are  deﬁ  ned relative to the original area and length of the test specimen. These values are  of interest in design because the designer expects that the strains experienced by any  component of the product will not signiﬁ  cantly change its shape. The components  are designed to withstand the anticipated stresses encountered in service.  

A typical engineering stress–strain curve from a tensile test of a metallic speci- men is illustrated in Figure 3.3. The  engineering stress  at any point on the curve is  deﬁ  ned as the force divided by the original area:  

$$
s=\frac{F}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $s=$  engineering stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ );  $F=$  applied force in the test, $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A_{o}=$  original area of the test specimen,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}$   $(\mathrm{in}^{2}]$ ). The  engineering strain  at any  point in the test is given by  

$$
e=\frac{L-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $e\:=\:$  engineering strain,  $\mathrm{mm/mm~(in/in)}$ ;  $L=$ length at any point during the  elongation, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and $L_{o}=$  original gage length, mm (in). The units of engineer- ing strain are given as $\mathrm{mm/mm}$  (in/in), but think of it as representing elongation per  unit length, without units.  

The stress–strain relationship in Figure 3.3 has two regions, indicating two dis- tinct forms of behavior: (1) elastic and (2) plastic. In the elastic region, the relation- ship between stress and strain is linear, and the material exhibits elastic behavior by  

![](images/d0bec5dc14bfbf80832d78675a36196cfd2800b33ec74d7a6c30553b276140c2.jpg)  

returning to its original length when the load (stress) is released. The relationship is  deﬁ  ned by  Hooke’s law :  

$$
s=E e
$$  

where  $E=$   modulus of elasticity  (also known as  Young’s modulus ), MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ,  a measure of the inherent stiffness of a material. It is a constant of proportionality  whose value is different for different materials. Table 3.1 presents typical values for  several materials, metals and nonmetals.  

As stress increases, some point in the linear relationship is ﬁ  nally reached at  which the material begins to yield. This  yield point   $Y$ of the material can be identi- ﬁ  ed in the ﬁ  gure by the change in slope at the end of the linear region. Because the  start of yielding is usually difﬁ  cult to see in a plot of test data (it does not usually oc- cur as an abrupt change in slope), $Y$  is typically deﬁ  ned as the stress at which a strain  offset of  $0.2\%$  from the straight line has occurred. More speciﬁ  cally, it is the point  where the stress–strain curve for the material intersects a line that is parallel to the  straight portion of the curve but offset from it by a strain of $0.2\%$ . The yield point is a  strength characteristic of the material, and is therefore often referred to as the  yield  strength  (other names include  yield stress  and  elastic limit ).  

The yield point marks the transition to the plastic region and the start of plas- tic deformation of the material. The relationship between stress and strain is no  longer guided by Hooke’s law. As the load is increased beyond the yield point,  elongation of the specimen proceeds, but at a much faster rate than before, caus- ing the slope of the curve to change dramatically, as shown in Figure 3.3. Elonga- tion is accompanied by a uniform reduction in cross-sectional area, consistent  with maintaining constant volume. Finally, the applied load  $F$  reaches a maxi- mum value, and the engineering stress calculated at this point is called the  tensile

strength  or  ultimate tensile strength  of the material. It is denoted as  TS  where  $T S=F_{\mathrm{max}}/A_{o}$ .  TS  and  $Y$  are important strength properties in design calculations.  (They are also used in certain manufacturing calculations.) Some typical values  of yield strength and tensile strength are listed in Table 3.2 for selected metals.  Conventional tensile testing of ceramics is difﬁ  cult, and an alternative test is used  to measure the strength of these brittle materials (Section 3.1.3). Polymers differ  in their strength properties from metals and ceramics because of viscoelasticity  (Section 3.5).  

To the right of the tensile strength on the stress–strain curve, the load begins  to decline, and the test specimen typically begins a process of localized elongation  known as  necking . Instead of continuing to strain uniformly throughout its length,  straining becomes concentrated in one small section of the specimen. The area of  that section narrows down (necks) signiﬁ  cantly until failure occurs. The stress calcu- lated immediately before failure is known as the  fracture stress .  

The amount of strain that the material can endure before failure is also a mechan- ical property of interest in many manufacturing processes. The common measure of  this property is  ductility , the ability of a material to plastically strain without frac- ture. This measure can be taken as either elongation or area reduction. Elongation  is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
E L=\frac{L_{f}-L_{o}}{L_{o}}
$$  

where $E L=$  elongation, often expressed as a percent;  $L_{f}=$  specimen length at frac- ture, mm (in), measured as the distance between gage marks after the two parts of  the specimen have been put back together; and $L_{o}=$  original specimen length, mm  (in). Area reduction is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
A R=\frac{A_{o}-A_{f}}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A R=$  area reduction, often expressed as a percent;  $A_{f}=$  area of the cross  section at the point of fracture,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ; and $A_{o}=$  original area,  $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\;(\mathrm{in}^{2})$ . There  are problems with both of these ductility measures because of necking that occurs in

metallic test specimens and the associated nonuniform effect on elongation and area  reduction. Despite these difﬁ  culties, percent elongation and percent area reduction  are the most commonly used measures of ductility in engineering practice. Some  typical values of percent elongation for various materials (mostly metals) are listed  in Table 3.3.  

# Example 3.1  Engineering  stress and strain  

A tensile test specimen has a starting gage length $=50\:\mathrm{mm}$  and a cross-sectional  area $=200\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ . During the test, the specimen yields under a load of  $32{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  (this is the  $0.2\%$  offset) at a gage length of $50.2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . The maximum  load of $65{,}000\,\mathrm{N}$  is reached at a gage length of $57.7\,\mathrm{mm}$  just before necking  begins. Final fracture occurs at a gage length of $63.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Determine (a) yield  strength, (b) modulus of elasticity, (c) tensile strength, (d) engineering strain at  maximum load, and (e) percent elongation.  

Solution:  (a) Yield strength $Y=32{,}000/200=160~\mathbf{MPa}.

$ (b) Subtracting the $0.2\%$  offset, engineering strain  $e=(50.2-50.0)/50.0\;-

$ $0.002=0.002$ Rearranging Equation (3.3), modulus of elasticity  $E=s/e=160/0.002=$  

 $\mathbf{80,000\,M P a}$ .

 (c) Tensile strength $=$  maximum load divided by original area: 

 ${\cal T}S=65{,}000/200=325~\mathrm{M}\mathrm{Pa}$ .

 (d) By Equation (3.2), engineering strain at maximum load  $e=$  

 $(57.7-50)/50={\bf0.154}$ .

 (e) Deﬁ  ned in Equation (3.4), percent elongation $E L=(59.5-50)/50=$  

 $\mathbf{0.19}=\mathbf{19\%}$ .  

True Stress–Strain   Thoughtful readers may be troubled by the use of the origi- nal area of the test specimen to calculate engineering stress, rather than the actual  (instantaneous) area that becomes increasingly smaller as the test proceeds. If the  actual area were used, the calculated stress value would be higher. The stress value  obtained by dividing the instantaneous value of area into the applied load is deﬁ  ned  as the  true stress :  

$$
\sigma={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where $\sigma=$  true stress, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  force, N (lb); and $A=$  actual (instantaneous)  area resisting the load, $\mathrm{mm}^{2}\left(\mathrm{in}^{2}\right)$ .  

Similarly,  true strain  provides a more realistic assessment of the “instantaneous”  elongation per unit length of the material. The value of true strain in a tensile test  can be estimated by dividing the total elongation into small increments, calculating  the engineering strain for each increment on the basis of its starting length, and then  adding up the strain values. In the limit, true strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\epsilon=\intop_{L_{o}}^{L}\!\!\frac{d L}{L}=\ln\frac{L}{L_{o}}
$$  

where  $L=$  instantaneous length at any moment during elongation. At the end of  the test (or other deformation), the ﬁ  nal strain value can be calculated using  $L=L_{f}.$  

When the engineering stress–strain data in Figure 3.3 are plotted using the true  stress and strain values, the resulting curve would appear as in Figure 3.4. In the elastic  region, the plot is virtually the same as before. Strain values are small, and true strain  is nearly equal to engineering strain for most metals of interest. The respective stress  values are also very close to each other. The reason for these near equalities is that  the cross-sectional area of the test specimen is not signiﬁ  cantly reduced in the elastic  region. Thus, Hooke’s law can be used to relate true stress to true strain:  $\sigma=E\epsilon$ .  

The difference between the true stress–strain curve and its engineering counter- part occurs in the plastic region. The stress values are higher in the plastic region  because the instantaneous cross-sectional area of the specimen, which has been  continuously reduced during elongation, is now used in the computation. As in the  

![](images/0a8fb54562737e2302cb7c4d05e5814ce98b29d1e6e02a775301a97e8eee694e.jpg)  
FIGURE 3.4  True  stress–strain curve for  the previous  engineering stress– strain plot in Figure 3.3.  

previous curve, a downturn ﬁ  nally occurs as a result of necking. A dashed line is used  in the ﬁ  gure to indicate the projected continuation of the true stress–strain plot if  necking had not occurred.  

As strain becomes signiﬁ  cant in the plastic region, the values of true strain and  engineering strain diverge. True strain can be related to the corresponding engineer- ing strain by  

$$
\epsilon=\ln(1+e)
$$  

Similarly, true stress and engineering stress can be related by the expression  

$$
\sigma=s\,(1\,+\,e)
$$  

In Figure 3.4, note that stress increases continuously in the plastic region until  necking begins. When this happened in the engineering stress–strain curve, its sig- niﬁ  cance was lost because an admittedly erroneous area value was used to calculate  stress. Now when the true stress also increases, it cannot be dismissed so lightly.  What it means is that the metal is becoming stronger as strain increases. This is the  property called  strain hardening  that was mentioned in the previous chapter in the  discussion of metallic crystal structures, and it is a property that most metals exhibit  to a greater or lesser degree.  

# Example 3.2  True stress and  strain  

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine (a) true stress and (b) true strain  at the maximum load of  $65{,}000\:\mathrm{N}.$ .  

Solution:  (a) True stress is deﬁ  ned as the load divided by the instantaneous  area. To ﬁ  nd the instantaneous area, we assume uniform elongation prior to  necking. Thus, $A L=A_{o}L_{o}$ , and $A=A_{o}L_{o}/L=200(50)/57.7=173.3\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}/$  

$$
{\sigma=F/A=65,\!000/173.3=375\;\mathrm{MPa}}
$$  

(b) By Equation (3.7), true strain $\epsilon=\ln(L/L_{o})=\ln(57.7/50)=$ $\ln(1.154)={\bf0.143}$ .  

Check:  Use Equations (3.8) and (3.9) to check these values:  

Using Equation (3.8) and the value of  $e$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\epsilon=\ln(1+0.154)=0.143$ .  

Using Equation (3.9) and the value of  $T S$  obtained in Example 3.1,  $\sigma=325(1+0.154)=375\,\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Comment:  Note that true stress is always greater than engineering stress, and  true strain is always less than engineering strain.  

Strain hardening, or  work hardening  as it is often called, is an important factor in  certain manufacturing processes, particularly metal forming. Accordingly, it is worth- while to examine the behavior of a metal as it is affected by this property. If the  portion of the true stress–strain curve representing the plastic region were plotted  on a log–log scale, the result would be a linear relationship, as shown in Figure 3.5.  

![](images/2568ff5aca665b9fc84e7b1a562fccf1c25a27242085edc83566c161baa241a7.jpg)  
FIGURE 3.5  True stress–strain  curve plotted on log–log scale.  

Because it is a straight line in this transformation of the data, the relationship  between true stress and true strain in the plastic region can be expressed as  

$$
\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}
$$  

This equation is called the  ﬂ  ow curve , and it provides a good approximation of the  behavior of metals in the plastic region, including their capacity for strain hardening.  The constant $K$  is called the  strength coefﬁ  cient , MPa  $(1{\mathrm{b}}/{\mathrm{in}}^{2}),$  and it equals the value  of true stress at a true strain value equal to one. The parameter  $n$  is called the  strain  hardening exponent , and it is the slope of the line in Figure 3.5. Its value is directly  related to a metal’s tendency to work harden. Typical values of $K$  and $n$  for selected  metals are given in Table 3.4.

For the data given in Example 3.1, determine the strength coefﬁ  cient and  strain hardening exponent in the ﬂ  ow curve equation: $\sigma=K\epsilon^{n}$ .  

Solution:  We have two points on the ﬂ  ow curve from which the ﬂ  ow curve  parameters can be determined: (1) at the yield point and (2) at the maximum  load.  

(1) At the yield point, engineering stress is very close to the value of true stress.  Thus, from Example 3.1, $\sigma=Y=160\,\mathrm{MPa}$ . True strain is calculated using the gage  length at yielding and adjusting for the  $0.2\%$  offset: $\epsilon=\ln(50.2/50-.002)=$  

 0.001998. The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $160=K(0.001998)^{n}$ .  

(2) At the maximum load, the values of true stress and true strain are  available from the solution of Example $3.2;\epsilon=0.143$  and  $\sigma=375\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  The corresponding ﬂ  ow curve equation is $375=K(0.143)^{n}$ .  

Solving for $n$  and $K$ ,  

(1) $K=160/(0.001998)^{n}$  and (2) $K=375/(0.143)^{n}$   $160/(0.001998)^{n}=375/(0.143)^{n}$  

 $\ln(160)-n\ln(0.001998)=\ln(375)-n\ln(0.143$  ln(0.143)

 $5.0752-(-6.2156)n=5.9269-(-1.9449)n

$ $5.0752+6.2156n=5.9269+1.9449n

$ $(6.2156-1.9449)n=5.9269-5.0752

$ $4.2707n=0.8517$        $n=0.1994$ Substituting back into (1): $K=160/(0.001998)^{0.1994}=552.7$ .  

Check:  Using (2):  $K=375/(0.143)^{0.1994}=552.7.$  

The ﬂ  ow curve equation is $\sigma={\tt552.7}\epsilon^{\tt0.1994}$ .  

Necking in a tensile test and in metal forming operations that stretch the work  part is closely related to strain hardening. As the test specimen is elongated during  the initial part of the test (before necking begins), uniform straining occurs through- out the length because if any element in the specimen becomes strained more than  the surrounding metal, its strength increases by work hardening, thus making it  more resistant to additional strain until the surrounding metal has been strained  an equal amount. Finally, the strain becomes so large that uniform straining cannot  be sustained. A weak point in the length develops (from buildup of dislocations at  grain boundaries, impurities in the metal, or other factors), and necking is initiated,  leading to failure. Empirical evidence reveals that necking begins for a particular  metal when the true strain reaches a value equal to the strain-hardening exponent $n$ .  Therefore, a higher $n$  value means that the metal can be strained further before the  onset of necking during tensile loading.  

Types of Stress–Strain Relationships  Much information about elastic–plastic  behavior is provided by the true stress–strain curve. As indicated, Hooke’s law  ( $\mathit{(\sigma=E\epsilon)}$ ) governs the metal’s behavior in the elastic region, and the ﬂ  ow curve  

![](images/8d5e447efc041717923fec58799d69344712cc5d7450b72b50acbece2dd1e56f.jpg)  
FIGURE 3.6  Three  categories of stress– strain relationship:  (a) perfectly elastic,  (b) elastic and perfectly  plastic, and (c) elastic  and strain hardening.  

$(\sigma\,=\,K\epsilon^{n})$ ) determines the behavior in the plastic region. Three basic forms of  stress–strain relationship describe the behavior of nearly all types of solid materi- als, shown in Figure 3.6:  

(a)  Perfectly elastic . The behavior of this material is deﬁ  ned completely by its stiff- ness, indicated by the modulus of elasticity  $\mathcal{L}$ . It fractures rather than yielding  to plastic ﬂ  ow. Brittle materials such as ceramics, many cast irons, and thermo- setting polymers possess stress–strain curves that fall into this category. These  materials are not good candidates for forming operations.  

(b)  Elastic and perfectly plastic . This material has a stiffness deﬁ  ned by  $E$ . Once  the yield strength  $Y$  is reached, the material deforms plastically at the same  stress level. The ﬂ  ow curve is given by  $K=Y$ and  $n=0$ . Metals behave in this  fashion when they have been heated to sufﬁ  ciently high temperatures that they  recrystallize rather than strain harden during deformation. Lead exhibits this  behavior at room temperature because room temperature is above the recrys- tallization point for lead.  

(c)  Elastic and strain hardening . This material obeys Hooke’s law in the elastic  region. It begins to ﬂ  ow at its yield strength  Y . Continued deformation requires  an ever-increasing stress, given by a ﬂ  ow curve whose strength coefﬁ  cient  $K$  is  greater than $Y$  and whose strain-hardening exponent $n$  is greater than zero. The  ﬂ  ow curve is generally represented as a linear function on a natural logarithmic  plot. Most ductile metals behave this way when cold worked.  

Manufacturing processes that deform materials through the application of   tensile  stresses include wire and bar drawing (Section 18.6) and stretch forming (Section 19.6.1).  

# 3.1.2 COMPRESSION PROPERTIES  

A compression test applies a load that squeezes a cylindrical specimen between two  platens, as illustrated in Figure 3.7. As the specimen is compressed, its height is re- duced and its cross-sectional area is increased. Engineering stress is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
s=\frac{F}{A_{o}}
$$  

where $A_{o}=$  original area of the specimen. This is the same deﬁ  nition of engineering  stress used in the tensile test. The engineering strain is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
e=\frac{h-h_{o}}{h_{o}}
$$  

![](images/182e8a5f4d0b6a8eeb830118ad0fefad66bdcb505f1a472c8bf948cac8660bd2.jpg)  

where $h=$  height of the specimen at a particular moment into the test, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and  $h_{o}=$  starting height,  $\mathrm{mm}$  (in). Because the height is decreased during compression,  the value of $e$  will be negative. The negative sign is usually ignored when expressing  values of compression strain.  

When engineering stress is plotted against engineering strain in a compression  test, the results appear as in Figure 3.8. The curve is divided into elastic and plas- tic regions, as before, but the shape of the plastic portion of the curve is different  from its tensile test complement. Because compression causes the cross section to  increase (rather than decrease as in the tensile test), the load increases more rapidly  than previously. This results in a higher value of calculated engineering stress.  

Something else happens in the compression test that contributes to the increase  in stress. As the cylindrical specimen is squeezed, friction at the surfaces in contact  with the platens tends to prevent the ends of the cylinder from spreading.   Additional

energy is consumed by this friction during the test, and this results in a higher applied  force. It also shows up as an increase in the computed engineering stress. Hence, ow- ing to the increase in cross-sectional area and friction between the specimen and the  platens, the characteristic engineering stress–strain curve in a compression test is  obtained, as shown in the ﬁ  gure.  

Another consequence of the friction between the surfaces is that the material  near the middle of the specimen is permitted to increase in area much more than  at the ends. This results in the characteristic  barreling  of the specimen, as seen in  Figure 3.9.  

Although differences exist between the engineering stress–strain curves in ten- sion and compression, when the respective data are plotted as true stress–strain,  the relationships are nearly identical (for almost all materials). Because tensile test  results are more abundant in the literature, values of the ﬂ  ow curve parameters  ( $^ Ḋ K Ḍ$  and $n$ ) can be derived from tensile test data and applied with equal validity to a  compression operation. What must be done in using the tensile test results for a com- pression operation is to ignore the effect of necking, a phenomenon that is peculiar  to straining induced by tensile stresses. In compression, there is no corresponding  collapse of the work. In previous plots of tensile stress–strain curves, the data were  extended beyond the point of necking by means of the dashed lines. The dashed lines  better represent the behavior of the material in compression than the actual tensile  test data.  

Compression operations in metal forming are much more common than stretch- ing operations. Important compression processes in industry include rolling, forging,  and extrusion (Chapter 18).  

# 3.1.3  BENDING AND TESTING OF BRITTLE MATERIALS  

Bending operations are used to form metal plates and sheets. As shown in Fig- ure 3.10, the process of bending a rectangular cross section subjects the material to  tensile stresses (and strains) in the outer half of the bent section and compressive  stresses (and strains) in the inner half. If the material does not fracture, it becomes  permanently (plastically) bent as shown in (3) of Figure 3.10.  

Hard, brittle materials (e.g., ceramics), which possess elasticity but little or no  plasticity, are often tested by a method that subjects the specimen to a bending  

![](images/4fa9287e7e474f4387d790a053742a087536a2b5fe6d46af83a3ed15bed0f89e.jpg)  
FIGURE 3.10  Bending of a rectangular cross section results in both tensile and compressive stresses in the  material: (1) initial loading; (2) highly stressed and strained specimen; and (3) bent part.  

load. These materials do not respond well to traditional tensile testing because of  problems in preparing the test specimens and possible misalignment of the press  jaws that hold the specimen. The  bending test  (also known as the  ﬂ  exure test ) is  used to test the strength of these materials, using a setup illustrated in the ﬁ  rst  diagram in Figure 3.10. In this procedure, a specimen of rectangular cross section  is positioned between two supports, and a load is applied at its center. In this con- ﬁ  guration, the test is called a three-point bending test. A four-point conﬁ  guration  is also sometimes used. These brittle materials do not ﬂ  ex to the exaggerated ex- tent shown in Figure 3.10; instead they deform elastically until immediately be- fore fracture. Failure usually occurs because the ultimate tensile strength of the  outer ﬁ  bers of the specimen has been exceeded. This results in  cleavage , a failure  mode associated with ceramics and metals operating at low service temperatures,  in which separation rather than slip occurs along certain crystallographic planes.  The strength value derived from this test is called the  transverse rupture strength ,  calculated from the formula  

$$
T R S={\frac{1.5F L}{b t^{2}}}
$$  

where  $T R S=$  transverse rupture strength, MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ); $F=$  applied load at fracture,  N (lb); $L=$ length of the specimen between supports, mm (in); and  $b$  and  $t$  are the  dimensions of the cross section of the specimen as shown in the ﬁ  gure, mm (in).  

The ﬂ  exure test is also used for certain nonbrittle materials such as thermoplastic  polymers. In this case, because the material is likely to deform rather than fracture,  TRS cannot be determined based on failure of the specimen. Instead, either of two  measures is used: (1) the load recorded at a given level of deﬂ  ection, or (2) the de- ﬂ  ection observed at a given load.  

# 3.1.4 SHEAR PROPERTIES  

Shear involves application of stresses in opposite directions on either side of a thin  element to deﬂ  ect it as shown in Figure 3.11. The shear stress is deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\tau={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

![](images/54903b7bc86140704dc9a1b301a1623b6698845dbec06069b59ac3b86084a573.jpg)  

where  $\tau=$  shear stress,  $\mathrm{lb/in^{2}}$  (MPa);  $F=$  applied force,  $\mathbf{N}$  (lb); and  $A=$  area over  which the force is applied, $\mathrm{in}^{2}\left(\mathrm{mm}^{2}\right)$ . Shear strain can be deﬁ  ned as  

$$
\gamma=\frac{\delta}{b}
$$  

where  $\gamma=$  shear strain, $\mathrm{mm/mm}\;(\mathrm{in/in});\delta=$ the deﬂ  ection of the element, mm (in);  and $b=$  the orthogonal distance over which deﬂ  ection occurs, mm (in).  

Shear stress and strain are commonly tested in a  torsion test , in which a thin- walled tubular specimen is subjected to a torque as shown in Figure 3.12. As torque  is increased, the tube deﬂ  ects by twisting, which is a shear strain for this geometry. The shear stress can be determined in the test by the equation  

$$
\tau=\frac{T}{2\pi R^{2}t}
$$  

where  $T=$  applied torque,  $\mathrm{N{-mm}}$  (lb-in);  $R\,=$ radius of the tube measured to the  neutral axis of the wall, $\mathrm{mm}$  (in); and $t=$  wall thickness, mm (in). The shear strain can  be determined by measuring the amount of angular deﬂ  ection of the tube, convert- ing this into a distance deﬂ  ected, and dividing by the gauge length  $L$ . Reducing this  to a simple expression,  

$$
\gamma={\frac{R\alpha}{L}}
$$  

where  $\upalpha=$  the angular deﬂ  ection (radians).  

A typical shear stress–strain curve is shown in Figure 3.13. In the elastic region,  the relationship is deﬁ  ned by  

$$
\tau=G\gamma
$$

where  $G\,=$  the  shear modulus , or  shear modulus of elasticity , MPa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ . For  most materials, the shear modulus can be approximated by  $G=0.4E$ , where  $E$  is the  conventional elastic modulus.  

In the plastic region of the shear stress–strain curve, the material strain hardens  to cause the applied torque to continue to increase until fracture ﬁ  nally   occurs.  The relationship in this region is similar to the ﬂ  ow curve. The shear stress at  fracture can be calculated and this is used as the  shear strength $S$  of the material.  Shear strength can be estimated from tensile strength data by the approximation:  $S=0.7(T S)$ .  

Because the cross-sectional area of the test specimen in the torsion test does not  change as it does in the tensile and compression tests, the engineering stress–strain  curve for shear derived from the torsion test is virtually the same as the true stress– strain curve.  

Shear processes are common in industry. Shearing action is used to cut sheet metal  in blanking, punching, and other cutting operations (Section 19.1). In machining, the  material is removed by the mechanism of shear deformation (Section 20.2).  

The hardness of a material is deﬁ  ned as its resistance to permanent indentation.  Good hardness generally means that the material is resistant to scratching and wear.  For many engineering applications, including most of the tooling used in manufac- turing, scratch and wear resistance are important characteristics. As the reader shall  see later in this section, there is a strong correlation between hardness and strength.  

3.2.1  HARDNESS TESTS  

Hardness tests are commonly used for assessing material properties because they  are quick and convenient. However, a variety of testing methods are appropriate  because of differences in hardness among different materials. The best-known hard- ness tests are Brinell and Rockwell.  

Brinell Hardness Test  The Brinell hardness test is widely used for testing metals  and nonmetals of low- to medium hardness. It is named after the Swedish engineer  who developed it around 1900. In the test, a hardened steel (or cemented carbide)  ball of $10{\mathrm{-mm}}$  diameter is pressed into the surface of a specimen using a load of 500,  1500, or  $3000~\mathrm{kg}$ . The load is then divided into the indentation area to obtain the  Brinell Hardness Number (BHN). In equation form,  

$$
H B=\frac{2F}{\pi D_{b}(D_{b}-\sqrt{D_{b}^{2}-D_{i}^{2}})}
$$  

where  $H B\;=$ Brinell Hardness Number (BHN);  $F\,=$  indentation load, kg;  $D_{b}\,=$ diameter of the ball, mm; and $D_{i}=$  diameter of the indentation on the surface, mm.  

These dimensions are indicated in Figure 3.14(a). The resulting BHN has units  of $\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ , but the units are usually omitted in expressing the number. For harder  materials (above $500\:\mathrm{BHN}$ ), the cemented carbide ball is used because the steel ball  experiences elastic deformation that compromises the accuracy of the reading. Also,  higher loads (1500 and $3000\;\mathrm{kg}$ ) are typically used for harder materials. Because of  differences in results under different loads, it is considered good practice to indicate  the load used in the test when reporting $H B$  readings.  

Rockwell Hardness Test  This is another widely used test, named after the met- allurgist who developed it in the early 1920s. It is convenient to use, and several  enhancements over the years have made the test adaptable to a variety of materials.  

In the Rockwell Hardness Test, a cone-shaped indenter or small-diameter ball,  with diameter $=1.6$  or  $3.2~\mathrm{mm}$  (1/16 or 1/8 in) is pressed into the specimen using  a minor load of $10\,\mathrm{kg}$ , thus seating the indenter in the material. Then, a major load  of  $150~\mathrm{kg}$  (or other value) is applied, causing the indenter to penetrate into the  

![](images/0207650a84486fd151f65d3351be12ec7735d70d9b1a45e832ee8b9777e04117.jpg)

specimen a certain distance beyond its initial position. This additional penetration  distance  $d$  is converted into a Rockwell hardness reading by the testing machine.  The sequence is depicted in Figure 3.14(b). Differences in load and indenter ge- ometry provide various Rockwell scales for different materials. The most common  scales are indicated in Table 3.5.  

Vickers Hardness Test  This test, also developed in the early 1920s, uses a pyra- mid-shaped indenter made of diamond. It is based on the principle that impressions  made by this indenter are geometrically similar regardless of load. Accordingly,  loads of various size are applied, depending on the hardness of the material to be  measured. The Vickers Hardness  $(H V)$  is then determined from the formula  

$$
H V={\frac{1.854\,F}{D^{2}}}
$$  

where  $F=$  applied load, $\mathrm{kg}$ , and $D=$  the diagonal of the impression made by the  indenter, mm, as indicated in Figure 3.14(c). The Vickers test can be used for all met- als and has one of the widest scales among hardness tests.  

Knoop Hardness Test  The Knoop test, developed in 1939, uses a pyramid-shaped  diamond indenter, but the pyramid has a length-to-width ratio of about 7:1, as indi- cated in Figure 3.14(d), and the applied loads are generally lighter than in the Vick- ers test. It is a microhardness test, meaning that it is suitable for measuring small,  thin specimens or hard materials that might fracture if a heavier load were applied.  The indenter shape facilitates reading of the impression under the lighter loads used  in this test. The Knoop hardness value ( HK ) is determined according to the formula  

$$
H K=14.2\,\frac{F}{D^{2}}
$$  

where  $F=\mathrm{load},\mathrm{kg}$ ; and  $D=$  the long diagonal of the indentor, mm. Because the  impression made in this test is generally very small, considerable care must be taken  in preparing the surface to be measured.  

Scleroscope  The previous tests base their hardness measurements either on the  ratio of applied load divided by the resulting impression area (Brinell, Vickers, and  Knoop) or by the depth of the impression (Rockwell). The Scleroscope is an in- strument that measures the rebound height of a “hammer” dropped from a certain  distance above the surface of the material to be tested. The hammer consists of a  weight with diamond indenter attached to it. The Scleroscope therefore measures  the mechanical energy absorbed by the material when the indenter strikes the sur- face. The energy absorbed gives an indication of resistance to penetration, which is  consistent with the deﬁ  nition of hardness. If more energy is absorbed, the rebound  will be less, meaning a softer material. If less energy is absorbed, the rebound will be  higher—thus a harder material. The primary use of the Scleroscope seems to be in  measuring the hardness of large parts of steel and other ferrous metals.  

Durometer  The previous tests are all based on resistance to permanent or plastic  deformation (indentation). The durometer is a device that measures the elastic de- formation of rubber and similar ﬂ  exible materials by pressing an indenter into the  surface of the object. The resistance to penetration is an indication of hardness, as  the term is applied to these types of materials.  

# 3.2.2  HARDNESS OF VARIOUS MATERIALS  

This section compares the hardness values of some common materials in the three  engineering material classes: metals, ceramics, and polymers.  

Metals  The Brinell and Rockwell hardness tests were developed at a time when  metals were the principal engineering materials. A signiﬁ  cant amount of data has been  collected using these tests on metals. Table 3.6 lists hardness values for selected metals.  

For most metals, hardness is closely related to strength. Because the method of  testing for hardness is usually based on resistance to indentation, which is a form of  compression, one would expect a good correlation between hardness and strength  properties determined in a compression test. However, strength properties in a com- pression test are nearly the same as those from a tension test, after allowances for  changes in cross-sectional area of the respective test specimens; so the correlation  with tensile properties should also be good.  

Brinell hardness  $(H B)$  exhibits a close correlation with the ultimate tensile  strength  TS  of steels, leading to the relationship [9], [15]:

where  $K_{h}$  is a constant of proportionality. If  $T S$  is expressed in MPa, then  $K_{h}=3.45$ ;  and if  TS  is in $\mathrm{{lb/in^{2}}}$ , then $K_{h}=500$ .  

Ceramics  The Brinell hardness test is not appropriate for ceramics because the  materials being tested are often harder than the indenter ball. The Vickers and  Knoop hardness tests are used to test these hard materials. Table 3.7 lists hardness  values for several ceramics and hard materials. For comparison, the Rockwell C  hardness for hardened tool steel is 65 HRC. The HRC scale does not extend high  enough to be used for the harder materials.  

Polymers  Polymers have the lowest hardness among the three types of engineer- ing materials. Table 3.8 lists several of the polymers on the Brinell hardness scale, al- though this testing method is not normally used for these materials. It does, however,  allow comparison with the hardness of metals.  

# 3.3 3.3  Effect of Temperature on Properties  

Temperature has a signiﬁ  cant effect on nearly all properties of a material. It is im- portant for the designer to know the material properties at the operating tempera- tures of the product when in service. It is also important to know how temperature  affects mechanical properties in manufacturing. At elevated temperatures, materials  are lower in strength and higher in ductility. The general relationships for metals are  depicted in Figure 3.15. Thus, most metals can be formed more easily at elevated  temperatures than when they are cold.  

![](images/5fea3b91d530155c8ea560b5a37ca6938b3ccf1c15cb1af3272687bd8f075480.jpg)  
FIGURE 3.15  General effect of  temperature on strength and ductility.  

Hot Hardness  A property often used to characterize strength and hardness at el- evated temperatures is hot hardness.  Hot hardness  is simply the ability of a material  to retain hardness at elevated temperatures; it is usually presented as either a listing  of hardness values at different temperatures or as a plot of hardness versus tempera- ture, as in Figure 3.16. Steels can be alloyed to achieve signiﬁ  cant improvements in  hot hardness, as shown in the ﬁ  gure. Ceramics exhibit superior properties at elevated  temperatures compared with other materials. They are often selected for high tem- perature applications, such as turbine parts, cutting tools, and refractory applications.  Good hot hardness is also desirable in the tooling materials used in many manu- facturing operations. Signiﬁ  cant amounts of heat energy are generated in most met- alworking processes, and the tools must be capable of withstanding the high tem- peratures involved.  

Recrystallization Temperature  Most metals behave at room temperature ac- cording to the ﬂ  ow curve in the plastic region. As the metal is strained, it increases in  strength because of strain hardening (the strain-hardening exponent  $n>0$ ). How- ever, if the metal is heated to a sufﬁ  ciently elevated temperature and then   deformed,  

![](images/014fc747f1ea967f342c73d77fb862743e35935a97e64a576069c9340a634694.jpg)  
FIGURE 3.16  Hot hardness—typical  hardness as a function of temperature for  several materials.  

strain hardening does not occur. Instead, new grains are formed that are free of  strain, and the metal behaves as a perfectly plastic material, that is, with a strain- hardening exponent  $n\,=\,0$ . The formation of new strain-free grains is a process  called  recrystallization , and the temperature at which it occurs is about one-half  the melting point  $(0.5~T_{m})$ , as measured on an absolute scale (R or K). This is called  the  recrystallization temperature . Recrystallization takes time. The recrystallization  temperature for a particular metal is usually speciﬁ  ed as the temperature at which  complete formation of new grains requires about 1 hour.  

Recrystallization is a temperature-dependent characteristic of metals that can be  exploited in manufacturing. By heating the metal to the recrystallization tempera- ture before deformation, the amount of straining that the metal can endure is sub- stantially increased, and the forces and power required to carry out the process are  signiﬁ  cantly reduced. Forming metals at temperatures above the recrystallization  temperature is called  hot working  (Section 17.3).  

Fluids behave quite differently than solids. A ﬂ  uid ﬂ  ows; it takes the shape of the  container that holds it. A solid does not ﬂ  ow; it possesses a geometric form that is  independent of its surroundings. Fluids include liquids and gases; the interest in this  section is on the former. Many manufacturing processes are accomplished on mate- rials that have been converted from solid to liquid state by heating. Metals are cast  in the molten state; glass is formed in a heated and highly ﬂ  uid state; and polymers  are almost always shaped as thick ﬂ  uids.  

Viscosity   Although ﬂ  ow is a deﬁ  ning characteristic of ﬂ  uids, the tendency to  ﬂ  ow varies for different ﬂ  uids. Viscosity is the property that determines ﬂ  uid ﬂ  ow.  Roughly,  viscosity  can be deﬁ  ned as the resistance to ﬂ  ow that is characteristic of a  ﬂ  uid. It is a measure of the internal friction that arises when velocity gradients are  present in the ﬂ  uid—the more viscous the ﬂ  uid is, the higher the internal friction  and the greater the resistance to ﬂ  ow. The reciprocal of viscosity is  ﬂ  uidity —the  ease with which a ﬂ  uid ﬂ  ows.  

Viscosity is deﬁ  ned more precisely with respect to the setup in Figure 3.17, in  which two parallel plates are separated by a distance $d$ . One of the plates is station- ary while the other is moving at a velocity  $\nu$ , and the space between the plates is  occupied by a ﬂ  uid. Orienting these parameters relative to an axis system,  $d$  is in  the $y$ -axis direction and $\nu$  is in the $x$ -axis direction. The motion of the upper plate is  

![](images/469c6004abd359b681596c3191a6a02c23644ccab6a3524130684957f6a7dbd7.jpg)  
FIGURE 3.17  Fluid  ﬂ  ow between two  parallel plates, one  stationary and the  other moving at  velocity  v.  

resisted by force  $F$  that results from the shear viscous action of the ﬂ  uid. This force  can be reduced to a shear stress by dividing $F$  by the plate area $A$ :  

$$
\tau={\frac{F}{A}}
$$  

where  $\tau=$  shear stress,  $\mathbf{N}/\mathbf{m}^{2}\mathrm{or}$  Pa  $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$ ). This shear stress is related to the rate of  shear, which is deﬁ  ned as the change in velocity  $d\nu$  relative to $d y$ . That is,  

$$
\dot{\gamma}=\frac{d\nu}{d y}
$$  

where $\dot{\gamma}=$  shear rate, $1/\mathrm{s};d\nu=$  incremental change in velocity,  $\mathrm{m/s}$  (in/sec); and  $d y=$ incremental change in distance y, m (in). The shear viscosity is the ﬂ  uid property that  deﬁ  nes the relationship between $F/A$  and $d\nu/d y$ ; that is,  

$$
\frac{F}{A}=\eta\frac{d\nu}{d y}\quad\mathrm{or}\quad\tau=\eta\dot{\gamma}
$$  

where  $\eta\,=\,\mathrm{a}$  constant of proportionality called the coefﬁ  cient of viscosity, Pa-s  (lb-sec/in 2 ). Rearranging Equation (3.25), the coefﬁ  cient of viscosity can be ex- pressed as follows:  

$$
\eta=\frac{\tau}{\dot{\gamma}}
$$  

Thus, the viscosity of a ﬂ  uid can be deﬁ  ned as the ratio of shear stress to shear rate  during ﬂ  ow, where shear stress is the frictional force exerted by the ﬂ  uid per unit  area, and shear rate is the velocity gradient perpendicular to the ﬂ  ow direction. The  viscous characteristics of ﬂ  uids deﬁ  ned by Equation (3.26) were ﬁ  rst stated by New- ton. He observed that viscosity was a constant property of a given ﬂ  uid, and such a  ﬂ  uid is referred to as a  Newtonian ﬂ  uid .  

The units of coefﬁ  cient of viscosity require explanation. In the International Sys- tem of units (SI), because shear stress is expressed in  $\mathbf{N}/\mathbf{m}^{2}$  or Pascals and shear rate  in $1/\mathrm{s}$ , it follows that $\eta$  has units of $\mathrm{N}.\mathrm{s}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$  or Pascal-seconds, abbreviated Pa-s. In the  U.S. customary units, the corresponding units are  $\mathrm{{lb/in^{2}}}$  and  $1/\mathrm{sec}$ , so that the units  for coefﬁ  cient of viscosity are lb-sec/in 2 . Other units sometimes given for viscosity  are poise, which  $=$  dyne-sec/cm 2  (10 poise  $=\,1$  Pa-s and  $\mathrm{6895~Pa-s}\,=\,1\ \mathrm{lb-sec/in^{2}}\$ ).  Some typical values of coefﬁ  cient of viscosity for various ﬂ  uids are given in Table 3.9.

Compiled from various sources. a Low-density polyethylene is used as the polymer example here; most other polymers have slightly higher viscosities. b Glass composition is mostly $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ ; compositions and viscosities vary; values given are representative.  

One can observe in several of the materials listed that viscosity varies with  temperature.  

Viscosity in Manufacturing Processes  For many metals, the viscosity in the  molten state compares with that of water at room temperature. Certain manufactur- ing processes, notably casting and welding, are performed on metals in their molten  state, and success in these operations requires low viscosity so that the molten metal  ﬁ  lls the mold cavity or weld seam before solidifying. In other operations, such as  metal forming and machining, lubricants and coolants are used in the process, and  again the success of these ﬂ  uids depends to some extent on their viscosities.  

Glass ceramics exhibit a gradual transition from solid to liquid states as tempera- ture is increased; they do not suddenly melt as pure metals do. The effect is illustrat- ed by the viscosity values for glass at different temperatures in Table 3.9. At room  temperature, glass is solid and brittle, exhibiting no tendency to ﬂ  ow; for all practical  purposes, its viscosity is inﬁ  nite. As glass is heated, it gradually softens, becoming less  and less viscous (more and more ﬂ  uid), until it can ﬁ  nally be formed by blowing or  molding at around $1100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(2000^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ .  

Most polymer-shaping processes are performed at elevated temperatures, at  which the material is in a liquid or highly plastic condition. Thermoplastic polymers  represent the most straightforward case, and they are also the most common poly- mers. At low temperatures, thermoplastic polymers are solid; as temperature is in- creased, they typically transform ﬁ  rst into a soft rubbery material, and then into  a thick ﬂ  uid. As temperature continues to rise, viscosity decreases gradually, as in  Table 3.9 for polyethylene, the most widely used thermoplastic polymer. However,  with polymers the relationship is complicated by other factors. For example, viscos- ity is affected by ﬂ  ow rate. The viscosity of a thermoplastic polymer is not a constant.  A polymer melt does not behave in a Newtonian fashion. Its relationship between  shear stress and shear rate can be seen in Figure 3.18. A ﬂ  uid that exhibits this de- creasing viscosity with increasing shear rate is called  pseudoplastic . This behavior  complicates the analysis of polymer shaping.

FIGURE 3.18  Viscous  behaviors of Newtonian  and pseudoplastic ﬂ  uids.  Polymer melts exhibit  pseudoplastic behavior.  For comparison, the  behavior of a plastic  solid material is shown.  

#  Viscoelastic Behavior of Polymers  

Another property that is characteristic of polymers is viscoelasticity.  Viscoelasticity is the property of a material that determines the strain it experiences when subjected  to combinations of stress and temperature over time. As the name suggests, it is a  combination of viscosity and elasticity. Viscoelasticity can be explained with refer- ence to Figure 3.19. The two parts of the ﬁ  gure show the typical response of two  materials to an applied stress below the yield point during some time period. The  material in (a) exhibits perfect elasticity; when the stress is removed, the material  returns to its original shape. By contrast, the material in (b) shows viscoelastic be- havior. The amount of strain gradually increases over time under the applied stress.  When stress is removed, the material does not immediately return to its original  shape; instead, the strain decays gradually. If the stress had been applied and then  immediately removed, the material would have returned immediately to its start- ing shape. However, time has entered the picture and played a role in affecting the  behavior of the material.  

A simple model of viscoelasticity can be developed using the deﬁ  nition of elas- ticity as a starting point. Elasticity is concisely expressed by Hooke’s law,  $\sigma\,=\,E\epsilon$ ,  which simply relates stress to strain through a constant of proportionality. In a vis- coelastic solid, the relationship between stress and strain is time dependent; it can  be expressed as  

$$
\sigma(t)=f(t)\epsilon
$$  

The time function $f(t)$  can be conceptualized as a modulus of elasticity that depends  on time. It might be written  $E(t)$  and referred to as a viscoelastic modulus. The form  of this time function can be complex, sometimes including strain as a factor. Without  getting into the mathematical expressions for it, the effect of the time dependency  can nevertheless be explored. One common effect can be seen in Figure 3.20, which  shows the stress–strain behavior of a thermoplastic polymer under different strain

rates. At low strain rate, the material exhibits signiﬁ  cant viscous ﬂ  ow. At high strain  rate, it behaves in a much more brittle fashion.  

Temperature is a factor in viscoelasticity. As temperature increases, the viscous  behavior becomes more and more prominent relative to elastic behavior. The  material becomes more like a ﬂ  uid. Figure 3.21 illustrates this temperature depend- ence for a thermoplastic polymer. At low temperatures, the polymer shows elastic  behavior. As  $T$  increases above the glass transition temperature  $T_{g}$ , the polymer be- comes viscoelastic. As temperature increases further, it becomes soft and rubbery.  At still higher temperatures, it exhibits viscous characteristics. The temperatures at  which these modes of   behavior are observed vary, depending on the plastic. Also, the  shapes of the modulus versus temperature curve differ according to the proportions  of crystalline and amorphous structures in the thermoplastic. Thermosetting poly- mers and elastomers behave differently than shown in the ﬁ  gure; after curing, these  polymers do not soften as thermoplastics do at elevated temperatures. Instead, they  degrade (char) at high temperatures.  

Viscoelastic behavior manifests itself in polymer melts in the form of shape  memory. As the thick polymer melt is transformed during processing from one  shape to another, it “remembers” its previous shape and attempts to return to  that geometry. For example, a common problem in extrusion of polymers is die

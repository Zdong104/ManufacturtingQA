14.6  Manufacture of Tires and Other   Rubber  Products  

This chapter considers those manufacturing processes  by which polymer matrix composites and rubbers are  shaped into useful components and products. Many  of the processes used for these materials are the same  as or similar to those used for plastics (Chapter 13).  After all, polymer matrix composites and rubbers are  polymeric materials. The difference is that they contain  some form of reinforcing ingredient. A  polymer matrix  composite  (PMC) is a composite material consisting  of a polymer embedded with a reinforcing phase such  as ﬁ  bers or powders. The technological and commer- cial importance of PMC processes derives from the  growing use of this class of material, especially ﬁ  ber- reinforced polymers (FRPs). In popular usage, PMC  generally refers to ﬁ  ber-reinforced polymers. FRP  composites can be designed with very high strength- to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios. These features  make them attractive in aircraft, cars, trucks, boats, and  sports equipment.  

The preceding deﬁ  nition of a polymer matrix com- posite could be applied to nearly all rubber products,  except that the polymer is an elastomer whereas the  polymer in a PMC is a plastic. Almost all rubber prod- ucts are reinforced with carbon black, which is what  gives pneumatic tires their characteristic black color.  Tires are the dominant product in the rubber industry.  They are used in large numbers for automobiles, trucks,  aircraft, and bicycles.  

The coverage in this chapter begins with PMCs that  are based on plastics. Sections 14.5 and 14.6 cover com- posites based on elastomers.

#  Overview of PMC Processing  

The variety of shaping methods for ﬁ  ber-reinforced polymers can be bewildering  on ﬁ  rst reading. A road map will be helpful to the reader entering this new territory.  FRP composite shaping processes can be divided into ﬁ  ve categories, as organized in  Figure 14.1: (1) open mold processes, (2) closed mold processes, (3) ﬁ  lament winding,  (4) pultrusion processes, and (5) miscellaneous. Open mold processes include some of  the original manual procedures for laying resins and ﬁ  bers onto forms. Closed mold  processes are much the same as those used in plastic molding; the reader will recognize  the names—compression molding, transfer molding, and injection molding—although  the names are sometimes changed and modiﬁ  cations are sometimes made for PMCs.  In  ﬁ  lament winding , continuous ﬁ  laments that have been dipped in liquid resin are  wrapped around a rotating mandrel; when the resin cures, a rigid, hollow, generally  cylindrical shape is created.  Pultrusion  is a shaping process for producing long, straight  sections of constant cross section; it is similar to extrusion, but adapted to include con- tinuous ﬁ  ber reinforcement. The “miscellaneous” category includes several operations  that do not ﬁ  t into the previous categories. To complicate matters, some of the proc- esses in the list are used to shape composites with continuous ﬁ  bers, whereas others are  used for short ﬁ  ber PMCs. Figure 14.1 identiﬁ  es the processes in each division.

Some of the PMC shaping processes are slow and labor intensive. In general,  techniques for shaping composites are less efﬁ  cient than manufacturing processes  for other materials. There are two reasons for this: (1) composite materials are more  complex than other materials, consisting as they do of two or more phases and the  need to orient the reinforcing phase in the case of ﬁ  ber-reinforced plastics; and (2)  processing technologies for composites have not been the object of improvement  and reﬁ  nement over as many years as processes for other materials.  

# 14.1.1 STARTING MATERIALS FOR PMCs  

In a PMC, the starting materials are a polymer and a reinforcing phase. They are  processed separately before becoming phases in the composite. This section con- siders how these materials are produced before being combined. Section 14.1.2  describes how they are combined to make the composite part.  

Both thermoplastics and thermosets are used as matrices in PMCs. Thermosetting  (TS) polymers are the most common matrix materials. The principal TS polymers  are phenolics, unsaturated polyesters, and epoxies. Phenolics are associated with  the use of particulate reinforcing phases, whereas polyesters and epoxies are more  closely associated with FRPs. Thermoplastic (TP) polymers are also used in PMCs,  in fact, most TP molding compounds are composite materials because they include  ﬁ  llers and/or reinforcing agents. Many of the polymer shaping processes discussed in  Chapter 13 are applicable to polymer matrix composites. However, combining the  polymer with the reinforcing agent sometimes complicates the operations.  

The reinforcing phase can be any of several geometries and materials. The  geometries include ﬁ  bers, particles, and ﬂ  akes, and the materials are ceramics, met- als, other polymers, or elements such as carbon or boron. The role of the reinforcing  phase and some of its technical features are discussed in Section 9.1.2.  

Common ﬁ  ber materials in FRPs are glass, carbon, and the polymer Kevlar. Fib- ers of these materials are produced by various techniques, some of which have been  covered in other chapters. Glass ﬁ  bers are produced by drawing through small ori- ﬁ  ces (Section 12.2.3). For carbon, a series of heating treatments is performed to con- vert a precursor ﬁ  lament containing a carbon compound into a more pure carbon  form. The precursor can be any of several substances, including poly acrylonitrile  (PAN), pitch (a black carbon resin formed in the distillation of coal tar, wood tar,  petroleum, etc.), or rayon (cellulose). Kevlar ﬁ  bers are produced by extrusion com- bined with drawing through small oriﬁ  ces in a spinneret (Section 13.4).  

Starting as continuous ﬁ  laments, the ﬁ  bers are combined with the polymer matrix  in any of several forms, depending on the properties desired in the material and the  processing method to be used to shape the composite. In some fabrication processes,  the ﬁ  laments are continuous, whereas in others, they are chopped into short lengths.  In the continuous form, individual ﬁ  laments are usually available as rovings. A  rov- ing  is a collection of untwisted (parallel) continuous strands; this is a convenient  form for handling and processing. Rovings typically contain from 12 to 120 individ- ual strands. By contrast, a  yarn  is a twisted collection of ﬁ  laments. Continuous rov- ings are used in several PMC processes, including ﬁ  lament winding and pultrusion.  

The most familiar form of continuous ﬁ  ber is a  cloth —a fabric of woven yarns.  Very similar to a cloth, but distinguished here, is a  woven roving , a fabric consisting  of untwisted ﬁ  laments rather than yarns. Woven rovings can be produced with une- qual numbers of strands in the two directions so that they possess greater strength in  one direction than the other. Such unidirectional woven rovings are often preferred  in laminated FRP composites.  

Fibers can also be prepared in the form of a  mat —a felt consisting of randomly  oriented short ﬁ  bers held loosely together with a binder, sometimes in a carrier fab- ric. Mats are commercially available as blankets of various weights, thicknesses, and  widths. Mats can be cut and shaped for use as  preforms  in some of the closed mold  processes. During molding, the resin impregnates the preform and then cures, thus  yielding a ﬁ  ber-reinforced molding.  

Particles and ﬂ  akes are really in the same class. Flakes are particles whose length  and width are large relative to thickness. These and other issues on characterization  of engineering powders are discussed in Section 15.1. Production methods for metal  powders are discussed in Section 15.2, and techniques for producing ceramic pow- ders are discussed in Section 16.1.1.  

# 14.1.2  COMBINING MATRIX AND REINFORCEMENT  

Incorporation of the reinforcing agent into the polymer matrix either occurs during  the shaping process or beforehand. In the ﬁ  rst case, the starting materials arrive at  the fabricating operation as separate entities and are combined into the compos- ite during shaping. Examples of this case are ﬁ  lament winding and pultrusion. The  starting reinforcement in these processes consists of continuous ﬁ  bers. In the second  case, the two component materials are combined into some preliminary form that  is convenient for use in the shaping process. Nearly all of the thermoplastics and  thermosets used in plastic shaping processes are really polymers combined with ﬁ  ll- ers (Section 8.1.5). The ﬁ  llers are either short ﬁ  bers or particulate (including ﬂ  akes).  

Of greatest interest in this chapter are the starting forms used in processes  designed for FRP composites. One might think of the starting forms as prefabricated  composites that arrive ready for use at the shaping process. These forms are molding  compounds and prepregs.  

Molding Compounds  Molding compounds are similar to those used in plastic  molding. They are designed for use in molding operations, and so they must be capa- ble of ﬂ  owing. Most molding compounds for composite processing are thermosetting  polymers. Accordingly, they have not been cured before shape processing. Curing is  done during and/or after ﬁ  nal shaping. FRP composite molding compounds consist  of the resin matrix with short, randomly dispersed ﬁ  bers. They come in several forms.  

Sheet molding compound  (SMC) is a combination of TS polymer resin, ﬁ  llers and  other additives, and chopped glass ﬁ  bers (randomly oriented) all rolled into a sheet  of typical thickness  $6.5\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.250 in). The most common resin is unsaturated poly- ester; ﬁ  llers are usually mineral powders such as talc, silica, limestone; and the glass  ﬁ  bers are typically 12 to  $75\;\mathrm{mm}$  (0.5–3.0 in) long and account for about $30\%$  of the  SMC by volume. SMCs are very convenient for handling and cutting to proper size  as molding charges. Sheet molding compounds are generally produced between thin  layers of polyethylene to limit evaporation of volatiles from the thermosetting resin.  The protective coating also improves surface ﬁ  nish on subsequent molded parts. The  process for fabricating continuous SMC sheets is depicted in Figure 14.2.  

Bulk molding compound  (BMC) consists of similar ingredients as those in SMC,  but the compounded polymer is in billet form rather than sheet. The ﬁ  bers in BMC  are shorter, typically 2 to  $12\:\mathrm{mm}$  (0.1–0.5 in), because greater ﬂ  uidity is required in  

![](images/6d4e7745304219e77185286d1c17c025a1f7afbd1d843d6fc16e0378d4f73ad2.jpg)

the molding operations for which these materials are designed. Billet diameter is  usually 25 to $50\:\mathrm{mm}$  (1–2 in). The process for producing BMC is similar to that for  SMC, except extrusion is used to obtain the ﬁ  nal billet form. BMC is also known  as  dough molding compound  (DMC), because of its dough-like consistency. Other  FRP molding compounds include  thick molding compound  (TMC), similar to SMC  but thicker—up to $50\,\mathrm{mm}$  (2 in); and  pelletized molding compounds— basically con- ventional plastic molding compounds containing short ﬁ  bers.  

Prepregs  Another prefabricated form for FRP shaping operations is  prepreg ,  which consists of ﬁ  bers impregnated with partially cured thermosetting resins to  facilitate shape processing. Completion of curing must be accomplished during and/ or after shaping. Prepregs are available in the form of tapes or cross-plied sheets or  fabrics. The advantage of prepregs is that they are fabricated with continuous ﬁ  la- ments rather than chopped random ﬁ  bers, thus increasing strength and modulus of  the ﬁ  nal product. Prepreg tapes and sheets are associated with advanced composites  (reinforced with boron, carbon/graphite, and Kevlar) as well as ﬁ  berglass.  

The distinguishing feature of this family of FRP shaping processes is its use of a  single positive or negative mold surface (Figure 14.3) to produce laminated FRP  structures. Other names for open mold processes include  contact lamination  and  contact molding . The starting materials (resins, ﬁ  bers, mats, and woven rovings) are  applied to the mold in layers, building up to the desired thickness. This is followed  by curing and part removal. Common resins are unsaturated polyesters and epoxies,  using ﬁ  berglass as the reinforcement. The moldings are usually large (e.g., boat hulls).  The advantage of using an open mold is that the mold costs much less than if two

FIGURE 14.3  Types of  open mold: (a) positive and  (b) negative.  

matching molds were used. The disadvantage is that only the part surface in contact  with the mold surface is ﬁ  nished; the other side is rough. For the best possible part  surface on the ﬁ  nished side, the mold itself must be very smooth.  

There are several important open mold FRP processes. The differences are in  the methods of applying the laminations to the mold, alternative curing techniques,  and other variations. In this section, three open mold processes for shaping ﬁ  ber- reinforced plastics are described: (1) hand lay-up, (2) spray-up, and (3) automated  tape-laying machines. Hand lay-up is treated as the base process and the others as  modiﬁ  cations and reﬁ  nements.  

# 14.2.1  HAND LAY-UP  

Hand lay-up is the oldest open mold method for FRP laminates, dating to the 1940s  when it was ﬁ  rst used to fabricate boat hulls. It is also the most labor-intensive method.  As the name suggests, hand lay-up is a shaping method in which successive layers of  resin and reinforcement are manually applied to an open mold to build the laminated  FRP composite structure. The basic procedure consists of ﬁ  ve steps, illustrated in  Figure 14.4. The ﬁ  nished molding must usually be trimmed with a power saw to size  the outside edges. In general, these same ﬁ  ve steps are required for all of the open  mold processes; the differences between methods occurring in steps 3 and 4.  

In step 3 of the hand lay-up process, each layer of ﬁ  ber reinforcement is dry when  placed onto the mold. The liquid (uncured) resin is then applied by pouring, brush- ing, or spraying. Impregnation of resin into the ﬁ  ber mat or fabric is accomplished  by hand rolling. This approach is referred to as  wet lay-up . An alternative approach  is to use  prepregs , in which the impregnated layers of ﬁ  ber reinforcement are ﬁ  rst  prepared outside the mold and then laid onto the mold surface. Advantages cited  for the prepregs include closer control over ﬁ  ber-resin mixture and more efﬁ  cient  methods of adding the laminations [16].

FIGURE 14.4  Hand  lay-up procedure:  (1) mold is cleaned  and treated with a mold  release agent; (2) a thin  gel coat   (resin, possibly  pigmented to color)  is applied, which will  become the   outside  surface of the   molding;  (3) when the gel coat  has   partially set,  successive layers of  resin and ﬁ  ber are  applied, the ﬁ  ber  being in the form of  mat or cloth; each  layer is rolled to fully  impregnate the ﬁ  ber  with resin and remove  air bubbles; (4) the part  is cured; and (5) the  fully hardened part is  removed from the mold.  

Molds for open mold contact laminating can be made of plaster, metal, glass  ﬁ  ber–reinforced plastic, or other materials. Selection of material depends on eco- nomics, surface quality, and other technical factors. For prototype fabrication, in  which only one part is produced, plaster molds are usually adequate. For medium  quantities, the mold can be made of ﬁ  berglass-reinforced plastic. High production  generally requires metal molds. Aluminum, steel, and nickel are used, sometimes  with surface hardening on the mold face to resist wear. An advantage of metal, in  addition to durability, is its high thermal conductivity that can be used to implement  a heat-curing system, or simply to dissipate heat from the laminate while it cures at  room temperature.  

Products suited to hand lay-up are generally large in size but low in production  quantity. In addition to boat hulls, other applications include swimming pools, large  container tanks, stage props, radomes, and other formed sheets. Automotive parts  have also been made, but the method is not economical for high production. The  largest moldings ever made by this process were ship hulls for the British Royal  Navy: $85\;\mathrm{m}$  (280 ft) long [3].  

# 14.2.2  SPRAY-UP  

This represents an attempt to mechanize the application of resin-ﬁ  ber layers and  to reduce the time for lay-up. It is an alternative for step 3 in the hand lay-up pro- cedure. In the spray-up method, liquid resin and chopped ﬁ  bers are sprayed onto  an open mold to build successive FRP laminations, as in Figure 14.5. The spray gun  is equipped with a chopper mechanism that feeds in continuous ﬁ  lament rovings  and cuts them into ﬁ  bers of length 25 to $75\;\mathrm{mm}$  (1–3 in) that are added to the resin  stream as it exits the nozzle. The mixing action results in random orientation of the  ﬁ  bers in the layer—unlike hand lay-up, in which the ﬁ  laments can be oriented if  desired. Another difference is that the ﬁ  ber content in spray-up is limited to about  $35\%$ , compared with a maximum of around  $65\%$  in hand lay-up. This is a shortcom- ing of the spraying and mixing process.  

Spraying can be accomplished manually using a portable spray gun or by an auto- mated machine in which the path of the spray gun is preprogrammed and compu- ter controlled. The automated procedure is advantageous for labor efﬁ  ciency and  environmental protection. Some of the volatile emissions from the liquid resins are  hazardous, and the path-controlled machines can operate in sealed-off areas without  FIGURE 14.5  Spray-up  method.

humans present. However, rolling is generally required for each layer, as in hand  lay-up.  

Products made by the spray-up method include boat hulls, bathtubs, shower stalls,  automobile and truck body parts, recreational vehicle components, furniture, large  structural panels, and containers. Movie and stage props are sometimes made by this  method. Because products made by spray-up have randomly oriented short ﬁ  bers,  they are not as strong as those made by lay-up, in which the ﬁ  bers are continuous  and directed.  

# 14.2.3 AUTOMATED TAPE-LAYING MACHINES  

This is another attempt to automate and accelerate step 3 in the lay-up procedure.  Automated tape-laying machines operate by dispensing a prepreg tape onto an  open mold following a programmed path. The typical machine consists of an over- head gantry, to which is attached the dispensing head, as shown in Figure 14.6. The  gantry permits x-y-z travel of the head, for positioning and following a deﬁ  ned con- tinuous path. The head itself has several rotational axes, plus a shearing device to  cut the tape at the end of each path. Prepreg tape widths are commonly  $75~\mathrm{mm}$  

 (3 in), although  $300\:\mathrm{{mm}}$  (12 in) widths have been reported [15]; thickness is around 

 $0.13\ \mathrm{mm}$  (0.005 in). The tape is stored on the machine in rolls, which are unwound  and deposited along the deﬁ  ned path. Each lamination is placed by following a  series of back-and-forth passes across the mold surface until the parallel rows of  tape complete the layer.  

Much of the work to develop automated tape-laying machines has been pio- neered by the aircraft industry, which is eager to save labor costs and at the same  time achieve the highest possible quality and uniformity in its manufactured compo- nents. The disadvantage of this and other computer numerically controlled machines  is that it must be programmed, and programming takes time.

# 14.2.4  CURING  

Curing (step 4) is required of all thermosetting resins used in FRP laminated com- posites. Curing accomplishes cross-linking of the polymer, transforming it from its  liquid or highly plastic condition into a hardened product. There are three principal  process parameters in curing: time, temperature, and pressure.  

Curing normally occurs at room temperature for the TS resins used in hand lay- up and spray-up procedures. Moldings made by these processes are often large, and  heating would be difﬁ  cult for such parts. In some cases, days are required before  room temperature curing is sufﬁ  ciently complete to remove the part. If feasible, heat  is added to speed the curing reaction.  

Heating is accomplished by several means. Oven curing provides heat at closely  controlled temperatures; some curing ovens are equipped to draw a partial vacuum.  Infrared heating can be used in applications in which it is impractical or inconven- ient to place the molding in an oven.  

Curing in an autoclave provides control over both temperature and pressure. An  autoclave  is an enclosed chamber equipped to apply heat and/or pressure at control- led levels. In FRP composites processing, it is usually a large horizontal cylinder with  doors at either end. The term  autoclave molding  is sometimes used to refer to the  curing of a prepreg laminate in an autoclave. This procedure is used extensively in the  aerospace industry to produce advanced composite components of very high quality.  

These molding operations are performed in molds consisting of two sections that  open and close during each molding cycle. One might think that a closed mold is  about twice the cost of a comparable open mold. However, tooling cost is even  greater owing to the more complex equipment required in these processes. Despite  their higher cost, advantages of a closed mold are (1) good ﬁ  nish on all part surfaces,  (2) higher production rates, (3) closer control over tolerances, and (4) more complex  three-dimensional shapes are possible.  

The closed mold processes are divided into three classes based on their counter- parts in conventional plastic molding, even though the terminology is often different  when polymer matrix composites are molded: (1) compression molding, (2) transfer  molding, and (3) injection molding.  

# 14.3.1  COMPRESSION MOLDING PMC PROCESSES  

In compression molding of conventional molding compounds (Section 13.7.1), a  charge is placed in the lower mold section, and the sections are brought together  under pressure, causing the charge to take the shape of the cavity. The mold halves  are heated to cure the thermosetting polymer. When the molding is sufﬁ  ciently  cured, the mold is opened and the part is removed. There are several shaping proc- esses for PMCs based on compression molding; the differences are mostly in the  form of the starting materials. The ﬂ  ow of the resin, ﬁ  bers, and other ingredients  during the process is a critical factor in compression molding of FRP composites.  

SMC, TMC, and BMC Molding  Several of the FRP molding compounds, namely  sheet molding compound (SMC), bulk molding compound (BMC), and thick mold- ing compound (TMC), can be cut to proper size and used as the starting charge in  

![](images/ecd6297081623d54662b1b6e81a44491bebe35432e52f21960366e76a5e4f5d2.jpg)  
FIGURE 14.7  Elastic reservoir molding: (1) foam is placed into mold between two ﬁ  ber layers; (2) mold is closed,  releasing resin from foam into ﬁ  ber layers.  

compression molding. Refrigeration is often required to store these materials prior  to shape processing. The names of the molding processes are based on the starting  molding compound (i.e.,  SMC molding  is when the starting charge is precut sheet  molding compound;  BMC molding  uses bulk molding compound cut to size as the  charge; and so on).  

Preform Molding  Another form of compression molding, called  preform molding   [16], involves placement of a precut mat into the lower mold section along with a  polymer resin charge (e.g., pellets or sheet). The materials are then pressed between  heated mold halves, causing the resin to ﬂ  ow and impregnate the ﬁ  ber mat to pro- duce a ﬁ  ber reinforced molding. Variations of the process use either thermoplastic  or thermosetting polymers.  

Elastic Reservoir Molding  The starting charge in elastic reservoir molding is  a sandwich consisting of a center of polymer foam between two dry ﬁ  ber layers.  The foam core is commonly open-cell polyurethane, impregnated with liquid resin  such as epoxy or polyester, and the dry ﬁ  ber layers can be cloth, woven roving,  or other starting ﬁ  brous form. As depicted in Figure 14.7, the sandwich is placed  in the lower mold section and pressed at moderate pressure—around  $0.7\ \mathrm{MPa}$   $(100\,1\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{in}^{2})$ ). As the core is compressed, it releases the resin to wet the dry surface  layers. Curing produces a lightweight part consisting of a low-density core and  thin FRP skins.  

# 14.3.2  TRANSFER MOLDING PMC PROCESSES  

In conventional transfer molding (Section 13.7.2), a charge of thermosetting resin  is placed in a pot or chamber, heated, and squeezed by ram action into one or more  mold cavities. The mold is heated to cure the resin. The name of the process derives  from the fact that the ﬂ  uid polymer is transferred from the pot into the mold. It can  be used to mold TS resins in which the ﬁ  llers include short ﬁ  bers to produce an FRP  composite part. Another form of transfer molding for PMCs is called  resin transfer  molding  (RTM) [6], [16]; it refers to a closed mold process in which a preform mat is  placed in the lower mold section, the mold is closed, and a thermosetting resin (e.g.,  polyester) is transferred into the cavity under moderate pressure to impregnate the  preform. To confuse matters, RTM is sometimes called  resin injection molding  [6],  [18] (the distinction between transfer molding and injection molding is blurry any- way, as the reader may have noted in Chapter 13). RTM has been used to manu- facture products such as bathtubs, swimming pool shells, bench and chair seats, and  hulls for small boats.  

Several enhancements of the basic RTM process have been developed [8]. One  enhancement, called  advanced RTM , uses high-strength polymers such as epoxy  resins and continuous ﬁ  ber reinforcement instead of mats. Applications include  aerospace components, missile ﬁ  ns, and snow skis. Two additional processes are  thermal expansion resin transfer molding and ultimately reinforced thermoset  resin injection.  Thermal expansion resin transfer molding  (TERTM) is a patented  process of TERTM, Inc. that consists of the following steps [8]: (1) A rigid polymer  foam (e.g., polyurethane) is shaped into a preform. (2) The preform is enclosed in  a fabric reinforcement and placed in a closed mold. (3) A thermosetting resin (e.g.,  epoxy) is injected into the mold to impregnate the fabric and surround the foam.  (4) The mold is heated to expand the foam, ﬁ  ll the mold cavity, and cure the resin.  Ultimately reinforced thermoset resin injection  (URTRI) is similar to TERTM  except that the starting foam core is cast epoxy embedded with miniature hollow  glass spheres.  

# 14.3.3  INJECTION MOLDING PMC PROCESSES  

Injection molding is noted for low-cost production of plastic parts in large quantities.  Although it is most closely associated with thermoplastics, the process can also be  adapted to thermosets (Section 13.6.5).  

Conventional Injection Molding  In PMC shape processing, injection molding is  used for both TP- and TS-type FRPs. In the TP category, virtually all thermoplastic  polymers can be reinforced with ﬁ  bers. Chopped ﬁ  bers must be used; if continuous  ﬁ  bers were used, they would be reduced anyway by the action of the rotating screw  in the barrel. During injection from the chamber into the mold cavity, the ﬁ  bers tend  to become aligned during their journey through the nozzle. Designers can some- times exploit this feature to optimize directional properties through part design,  location of gates, and cavity orientation relative to the gate [13].  

Whereas TP molding compounds are heated and then injected into a cold mold,  TS polymers are injected into a heated mold for curing. Control of the process with  thermosets is trickier because of the risk of premature cross-linking in the injection  chamber. Subject to the same risk, injection molding can be applied to ﬁ  ber-rein- forced TS plastics in the form of pelletized molding compound and dough molding  compound.  

Reinforced Reaction Injection Molding  Some thermosets cure by chemical  reaction rather than heat; these resins can be molded by reaction injection mold- ing (Section 13.6.5). In RIM, two reactive ingredients are mixed and immediately  injected into a mold cavity where curing and solidiﬁ  cation of the chemicals occur  rapidly. A closely related process includes reinforcing ﬁ  bers, typically glass, in the  mixture. In this case, the process is called reinforced reaction injection molding  (RRIM). Its advantages are similar to those in RIM, with the added beneﬁ  t of ﬁ  ber  reinforcement. RRIM is used extensively in auto body and truck cab applications for  bumpers, fenders, and other body parts.  

#  Other PMC Shaping Processes  

This section describes the remaining categories of PMC shaping processes: ﬁ  lament  winding, pultrusion processes, and miscellaneous PMC shaping processes.  

# 14.4.1  FILAMENT WINDING  

Filament winding is a process in which resin-impregnated continuous ﬁ  bers are  wrapped around a rotating mandrel that has the internal shape of the desired FRP  product. The resin is subsequently cured and the mandrel removed. Hollow axisym- metric components (usually circular in cross section) are produced, as well as some  irregular shapes. The most common form of the process is depicted in Figure 14.8.  A band of ﬁ  ber rovings is pulled through a resin bath immediately before being  wound in a helical pattern onto a cylindrical mandrel. Continuation of the winding  pattern ﬁ  nally completes a surface layer of one ﬁ  lament thickness on the mandrel.  The operation is repeated to form additional layers, each having a criss-cross pattern  with the previous, until the desired part thickness has been obtained.  

There are several methods by which the ﬁ  bers can be impregnated with resin:  (1)  wet winding , in which the ﬁ  lament is pulled through the liquid resin just before  winding, as in the ﬁ  gure; (2)  prepreg winding  (also called  dry winding ), in which  ﬁ  laments preimpregnated with partially cured resin are wrapped around a heated  mandrel; and (3)  post impregnation , in which ﬁ  laments are wound onto a mandrel  and then impregnated with resin by brushing or other technique.  

Two basic winding patterns are used in ﬁ  lament winding: (a) helical and (b) polar  (Figure 14.9). In  helical winding , the ﬁ  lament band is applied in a spiral pattern  around the mandrel, at a helix angle  u . If the band is wrapped with a helix angle  approaching $90^{\circ}$ , so that the winding advance is one bandwidth per revolution and  the ﬁ  laments form nearly circular rings around the mandrel, this is referred to as a  hoop winding ; it is a special case of helical winding. In  polar winding , the ﬁ  lament  is wrapped around the long axis of the mandrel, as in Figure 14.9(b); after each lon- gitudinal revolution, the mandrel is indexed (partially rotated) by one bandwidth,  so that a hollow enclosed shape is gradually created. Hoop and polar patterns can

be combined in successive windings of the mandrel to produce adjacent layers with  ﬁ  lament directions that are approximately perpendicular; this is called a  bi-axial  winding  [3].  

Filament winding machines have motion capabilities similar to those of an engine  lathe (Section 21.2.3). The typical machine has a drive motor to rotate the man- drel and a powered feed mechanism to move the carriage. Relative motion between  mandrel and carriage must be controlled to accomplish a given winding pattern. In  helical winding, the relationship between helix angle and the machine parameters  can be expressed as follows:  

$$
\tan\theta=\frac{\nu_{c}}{\pi D N}
$$  

where  $\theta\:=\:$  helix angle of the windings on the mandrel, as in Figure 14.9(a);  $\nu_{c}=$ speed at which the carriage traverses in the axial direction,  $\mathrm{m/s}$  (in/sec); $D=$  diam- eter of the mandrel, m (in); and $N=$  rotational speed,  $1/\mathrm{s}$  (rev/sec).  

Various types of control are available in ﬁ  lament winding machines. Modern  equipment uses  computer numerical control  (CNC, Section 37.3), in which mandrel  rotation and carriage speed are independently controlled to permit greater adjust- ment and ﬂ  exibility in the relative motions. CNC is especially useful in helical wind- ing of contoured shapes, as in Figure 14.10. As indicated in Equation (14.1), the ratio  $\nu_{c}/D N$  must remain ﬁ  xed to maintain a constant helix angle  $\theta$ . Thus, either $\nu_{c}$  and/or  $N$  must be adjusted on-line to compensate for changes in $D$ .

The  mandrel  is the special tooling that determines the geometry of the ﬁ  lament- wound part. For part removal, mandrels must be capable of collapsing after winding  and curing. Various designs are possible, including inﬂ  atable/deﬂ  atable mandrels,  collapsible metal mandrels, and mandrels made of soluble salts or plasters.  

Applications of ﬁ  lament winding are often classiﬁ  ed as aerospace or commer- cial [15], the engineering requirements being more demanding in the ﬁ  rst category.  Aerospace applications include rocket-motor cases, missile bodies, radomes, heli- copter blades, and airplane tail sections and stabilizers. These components are made  of advanced composites and hybrid composites (Section 9.4.1), with epoxy resins  being most common and reinforced with ﬁ  bers of carbon, boron, Kevlar, and glass.  Commercial applications include storage tanks, reinforced pipes and tubing, drive  shafts, wind-turbine blades, and lightning rods; these are made of conventional FRPs.  Polymers include polyester, epoxy, and phenolic resins; glass is the common reinforc- ing ﬁ  ber.  

# 14.4.2 PULTRUSION PROCESSES  

The basic pultrusion process was developed around 1950 for making ﬁ  shing rods of  glass ﬁ  ber–reinforced polymer (GFRP). The process is similar to extrusion (hence  the similarity in name), but it involves pulling of the workpiece (so the preﬁ  x “pul-”  is used in place of “ex-”). Like extrusion, pultrusion produces continuous, straight  sections of constant cross section. A related process, called pulforming, can be used  to make parts that are curved and may have variations in cross section throughout  their lengths.  

Pultrusion  Pultrusion is a process in which continuous ﬁ  ber rovings are dipped  into a resin bath and pulled through a shaping die where the impregnated resin  cures. The setup is sketched in Figure 14.11, which shows the cured product being  cut into long, straight sections. The sections are reinforced throughout their length  by continuous ﬁ  bers. Like extrusion, the pieces have a constant cross section, whose  proﬁ  le is determined by the shape of the die opening.  

FIGURE 14.11  Pultrusion process (see  text for interpretation of  sequence numbers).  

![](images/df7c411a8a9229ec9b0ae600d0c1bd2690b51110c3df61ade2f21c93502d9cd6.jpg)  

The process consists of ﬁ  ve steps (identiﬁ  ed in the sketch) performed in a con- tinuous sequence [3]: (1)  ﬁ  lament feeding , in which the ﬁ  bers are unreeled from  a creel (shelves with skewers that hold ﬁ  lament bobbins); (2)  resin impregnation ,  in which the ﬁ  bers are dipped in the uncured liquid resin; (3)  pre-die forming — the collection of ﬁ  laments is gradually shaped into the approximate cross sec- tion desired; (4)  shaping and curing , in which the impregnated ﬁ  bers are pulled  through the heated die whose length is  $1{-}1.5\:\mathrm{m}$  (3–5 ft) and whose inside surfaces  are highly polished; and (5)  pulling and cutting —pullers are used to draw the  cured length through the die, after which it is cut by a cut-off wheel with SiC or  diamond grits.  

Common resins used in pultrusion are unsaturated polyesters, epoxies, and sili- cones, all thermosetting polymers. There are difﬁ  culties in processing with epoxy  polymers because of sticking on the die surface. Thermoplastics have also been stud- ied for possible applications [3]. E-glass is by far the most widely used reinforc- ing material; proportions range from  $30\%$  to $70\%$ . Modulus of elasticity and tensile  strength increase with reinforcement content. Products made by pultrusion include  solid rods, tubing, long and ﬂ  at sheets, structural sections (such as channels, angled  and ﬂ  anged beams), tool handles for high-voltage work, and third-rail covers for  subways.  

Pulforming  The pultrusion process is limited to straight sections of constant cross  section. There is also a need for long parts with continuous ﬁ  ber reinforcement that  are curved rather than straight and whose cross sections may vary throughout the  length. The pulforming process is suited to these less-regular shapes. Pulforming can  be deﬁ  ned as pultrusion with additional steps to form the length into a semicircular  contour and alter the cross section at one or more locations along the length. A  sketch of the equipment is illustrated in Figure 14.12. After exiting the shaping die,  the continuous workpiece is fed into a rotating table with negative molds positioned  around its periphery. The work is forced into the mold cavities by a die shoe, which  squeezes the cross section at various locations and forms the curvature in the length.  The diameter of the table determines the radius of the part. As the work leaves the  die table, it is cut to length to provide discrete parts. Resins and ﬁ  bers used in pul- forming are similar to those for pultrusion. An important application of the process  is production of automobile leaf springs.

# 14.4.3  MISCELLANEOUS PMC SHAPING PROCESSES  

Additional PMC shaping processes worth noting include centrifugal casting, tube  rolling, continuous laminating, and cutting. In addition, many of the traditional ther- moplastic shaping processes are applicable to (short-ﬁ  ber) FRPs based on TP poly- mers; these include blow molding, thermoforming, and extrusion.  

Centrifugal Casting  This process is ideal for cylindrical products such as pipes  and tanks. The process is the same as its counterpart in metal casting (Section 11.3.5).  Chopped ﬁ  bers combined with liquid resin are poured into a fast-rotating cylindrical  mold that is heated. Centrifugal force presses the ingredients against the mold wall,  where curing takes place. The resulting inner surfaces of the part are quite smooth.  Part shrinkage or use of split molds permits part removal.  

Tube Rolling  FRP tubes can be fabricated from prepreg sheets by a rolling tech- nique [11], shown in Figure 14.13. Such tubes are used in bicycle frames and space  trusses. In the process, a precut prepreg sheet is wrapped around a cylindrical man- drel several times to obtain a tube wall of multiple sheet thicknesses. The rolled  sheets are then encased in a heat-shrinking sleeve and oven cured. As the sleeve  contracts, entrapped gases are squeezed out the ends of the tube. When curing is  complete, the mandrel is removed to yield a rolled FRP tube. The operation is sim- ple, and tooling cost is low. There are variations in the process, such as using different  wrapping methods or using a steel mold to enclose the rolled prepreg tube for better  dimensional control.  

Continuous Laminating  Fiber-reinforced plastic panels, sometimes translucent  and/or corrugated, are used in construction. The process to produce them consists of  (1) impregnating layers of glass ﬁ  ber mat or woven fabric by dipping in liquid resin  or by passing beneath a doctor blade; (2) gathering between cover ﬁ  lms (cellophane,  polyester, or other polymer); and (3) compacting between squeeze rolls and curing.  Corrugation (4) is added by formed rollers or mold shoes.  

Cutting Methods  FRP laminated composites must be cut in both uncured and  cured states. Uncured materials (prepregs, preforms, SMCs, and other starting  forms) must be cut to size for lay-up, molding, and so on. Typical cutting tools include  knives, scissors, power shears, and steel-rule blanking dies. Also used are nontradi- tional cutting methods, such as laser beam cutting and water jet cutting (Chapter 25).  

Cured FRPs are hard, tough, abrasive, and difﬁ  cult to cut; but cutting is neces- sary in many FRP shaping processes to trim excess material, cut holes and outlines,  and so forth. For ﬁ  berglass-reinforced plastics, cemented carbide cutting tools and  

![](images/20c49af988d8d9597d7a0cc3ca28d1a1ac2bfde9143e9ce7875d91c976e589ce.jpg)  
FIGURE 14.13  Tube  rolling, showing (a) one  possible means of  wrapping FRP prepregs  around a mandrel,  and (b) the completed  tube after curing and  removal of mandrel.  

high-speed steel saw blades must be used. For some advanced composites (e.g.,  boron-epoxy), diamond cutting tools obtain best results. Water jet cutting is also  used with good success on cured FRPs; this process reduces the dust and noise  problems associated with conventional sawing methods.  

#  Rubber Processing and Shaping  

Although pneumatic tires date from the late 1880s, rubber technology can be traced  to the discovery of vulcanization in 1839 (Historical Note 8.2), the process by which  raw natural rubber is transformed into a usable material through cross-linking of the  polymer molecules. During its ﬁ  rst century, the rubber industry was concerned only  with the processing of natural rubber. Around World War II, synthetic rubbers were  developed (Historical Note 8.3), and today they account for the majority of rubber  production.  

Production of rubber goods can be divided into two basic steps: (1) production of  the rubber itself, and (2) processing of the rubber into ﬁ  nished goods. Production of  rubber differs, depending on whether it is natural or synthetic. The difference is in  the raw materials. Natural rubber (NR) is produced as an agricultural crop, whereas  most synthetic rubbers are made from petroleum.  

Production of rubber is followed by processing into ﬁ  nal products; this consists of  (1) compounding, (2) mixing, (3) shaping, and (4) vulcanizing. Processing techniques  for natural and synthetic rubbers are virtually the same, differences being in the  chemicals used to effect vulcanization (cross-linking). This sequence does not apply  to thermoplastic elastomers, whose shaping techniques are the same as for other  thermoplastic polymers.  

There are several distinct industries involved in the production and processing  of rubber. Production of raw natural rubber might be classiﬁ  ed as farming because  latex, the starting ingredient for natural rubber, is grown on large plantations  located in tropical climates. By contrast, synthetic rubbers are produced by the pet- rochemical industry. Finally, the processing of these materials into tires, shoe soles,  and other rubber products occurs at processor (fabricator) plants. The processors  are commonly known as the rubber industry. Some of the great names in this indus- try include Goodyear, B. F. Goodrich, and Michelin. The importance of the tire is  reﬂ  ected in these names.  

# 14.5.1  PRODUCTION OF RUBBER  

This section surveys the production of rubber before it goes to the processor, distin- guishing between natural rubber and synthetic rubber.  

Natural Rubber  Natural rubber is tapped from rubber trees ( Hevea brasiliensis )  as latex. The trees are grown on plantations in Southeast Asia and other parts of the  world. Latex is a colloidal dispersion of solid particles of the polymer polyisoprene  (Section 8.4.2) in water. Polyisoprene is the chemical substance that comprises rub- ber, and its content in the emulsion is about  $30\%$ . The latex is collected in large  tanks, thus blending the yield of many trees together.  

The preferred method of recovering rubber from the latex involves coagulation.  The latex is ﬁ  rst diluted with water to about half its natural concentration. An acid  such as formic acid (HCOOH) or acetic acid ( $(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\mathrm{COOH})$ ) is added to cause the  latex to coagulate after about 12 hours. The coagulum, now in the form of soft solid  slabs, is then squeezed through a series of rolls that drive out most of the water and  reduce the thickness to about $3\:\mathrm{mm}$  (1/8 in). The ﬁ  nal rolls have grooves that impart  a criss-cross pattern to the resulting sheets. The sheets are then draped over wooden  frames and dried in smokehouses. The hot smoke contains creosote, which prevents  mildew and oxidation of the rubber. Several days are normally required to com- plete the drying process. The resulting rubber, now in a form called  ribbed smoked  sheet  is folded into large bales for shipment to the processor. This raw rubber has a  characteristic dark brown color. In some cases, the sheets are dried in hot air rather  than smokehouses, and the term  air-dried sheet  is applied; this is considered to be  a better grade of rubber. A still better grade, called  pale crepe  rubber, involves two  coagulation steps; the ﬁ  rst removes undesirable components of the latex, then the  resulting coagulum is subjected to a more involved washing and mechanical working  procedure, followed by warm air drying. The color of pale crepe rubber approaches  a light tan.  

Synthetic Rubber  The various types of synthetic rubber were identiﬁ  ed in Section  8.4.3. Most synthetics are produced from petroleum by the same polymerization  techniques used to synthesize other polymers (Section 8.1.1). However, unlike ther- moplastic and thermosetting polymers, which are normally supplied to the fabrica- tor as pellets or liquid resins, synthetic rubbers are supplied to rubber processors  in the form of large bales. The industry has developed a long tradition of handling  natural rubber in these unit loads.  

# 14.5.2  COMPOUNDING AND MIXING  

Rubber is always compounded with additives. It is through compounding that the  speciﬁ  c rubber is designed to satisfy a the requirements of a given application in  terms of properties, cost, and processability. Compounding adds chemicals for vul- canization. Sulfur has traditionally been used for this purpose. The vulcanization  process and the chemicals used to accomplish it are discussed in Section 14.5.4.  

Additives include ﬁ  llers that act either to enhance the rubber’s mechanical prop- erties (reinforcing ﬁ  llers) or to extend the rubber to reduce cost (nonreinforcing  ﬁ  llers). The single most important reinforcing ﬁ  ller in rubber is  carbon black , a col- loidal form of carbon, black in color, obtained from the thermal decomposition of  hydrocarbons (soot). Its effect is to increase tensile strength and resistance to abra- sion and tearing of the ﬁ  nal rubber product. Carbon black also provides protection  from ultraviolet radiation. These enhancements are especially important in tires.  Most rubber parts are black in color because of their carbon black content.  

Although carbon black is the most important ﬁ  ller, others are also used. They  include china clays—hydrous aluminum silicates  $(\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{Si}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{5}(\mathrm{OH})_{4})$ —which provide  less reinforcing than carbon black but are used when the black color is not accept- able; calcium carbonate  $\left(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\right)$ , which is a nonreinforcing ﬁ  ller; silica  $(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})$ ,  which can serve reinforcing or nonreinforcing functions depending on particle  size; and other polymers, such as styrene, PVC, and phenolics. Reclaimed (recy- cled) rubber is also added as a ﬁ  ller in some rubber products, but usually not in  proportions exceeding $10\%$ .  

Other additives compounded with the rubber include antioxidants, to retard  aging by oxidation; fatigue- and ozone-protective chemicals; coloring pigments;  

![](images/4ce671d096f6ea304aeb38ac9874af23276dccd9ac5f3a7893f97eaebec55340.jpg)

plasticizers and softening oils; blowing agents in the production of foamed rubber;  and mold-release compounds.  

Many products require ﬁ  lament reinforcement to reduce extensibility but retain  the other desirable properties of rubber. Tires and conveyor belts are notable exam- ples. Filaments used for this purpose include cellulose, nylon, and polyester. Fiber- glass and steel are also used as reinforcements (e.g., steel-belted radial tires). These  continuous ﬁ  ber materials must be added during the shaping process; they are not  mixed with the other additives.  

The additives must be thoroughly mixed with the base rubber to achieve uni- form dispersion of the ingredients. Uncured rubbers possess high viscosity. Mechani- cal working experienced by the rubber can increase its temperature up to  $150^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ $(300^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$ . If vulcanizing agents were present from the start of mixing, premature vul- canization would result—the rubber processor’s nightmare [14]. Accordingly, a two- stage mixing process is usually employed. In the ﬁ  rst stage, carbon black and other  nonvulcanizing additives are combined with the raw rubber. The term  masterbatch is used for this ﬁ  rst-stage mixture. After thorough mixing has been accomplished,  and time for cooling has been allowed, the second stage is carried out in which the  vulcanizing agents are added.  

Equipment for mixing includes the two-roll mill and internal mixers such as the  Banbury mixer, Figure 14.14. The  two-roll mill  consists of two parallel rolls, sup- ported in a frame so they can be brought together to obtain a desired “nip” (gap  size), and driven to rotate at the same or slightly different speeds. An  internal mixer has two rotors enclosed in a casing, as in Figure 14.14(b) for the Banbury-type  internal mixer. The rotors have blades and rotate in opposite directions at different  speeds, causing a complex ﬂ  ow pattern in the contained mixture.  

# 14.5.3  SHAPING AND RELATED PROCESSES  

Shaping processes for rubber products can be divided into four basic categories: (1)  extrusion, (2) calendering, (3) coating, and (4) molding and casting. Most of these  processes are discussed in the previous chapter. Here the special issues that arise  when they are applied to rubber are examined. Some products require several basic  processes plus assembly work in their manufacture, tires for example.  

![](images/bab398f79a853dbd616daa50d4d27430267e7050d7c56f847d2080bf4a4084ed.jpg)  
FIGURE 14.15  Roller die process:  extrusion of rubber followed by rolling.  

Extrusion  Extrusion of polymers was discussed in the preceding chapter. Screw  extruders are generally used for extrusion of rubber. As with extrusion of thermo- setting plastics, the $L/D$  ratio of the extruder barrels is less than for thermoplastics,  typically in range 10 to 15, to reduce the risk of premature cross-linking. Die swell  occurs in rubber extrudates, because the polymer is in a highly plastic condition and  exhibits the memory property. It has not yet been vulcanized.  

Calendering  This process involves passing rubber stock through a series of gaps  of decreasing size made by a stand of rotating rolls (Section 13.3). The rubber process  must be operated at lower temperatures than for thermoplastic polymers to avoid  premature vulcanization. Also, equipment used in the rubber industry is of heavier  construction than that used for thermoplastics, because rubber is more viscous and  harder to form. The output of the process is a rubber sheet of thickness determined  by the ﬁ  nal roll gap; again, swelling occurs in the sheet, causing its thickness to be  slightly greater than the gap size. Calendering can also be used to coat or impregnate  textile fabrics to produce rubberized fabrics.  

There are problems in producing thick sheet by either extrusion or calendering.  Thickness control is difﬁ  cult in the former process, and air entrapment occurs in the  latter. These problems are largely solved when extrusion and calendering are com- bined in the  roller die  process (Figure 14.15). The extruder die is a slit that feeds the  calender rolls.  

Coating  Coating or impregnating fabrics with rubber is an important process in  the rubber industry. These composite materials are used in automobile tires, con- veyor belts, inﬂ  atable rafts, and waterproof cloth for tarpaulins, tents, and rain coats.  The  coating  of rubber onto substrate fabrics includes a variety of processes. Cal- endering is one of the coating methods. Figure 14.16 illustrates one possible way in  which the fabric is fed into the calendering rolls to obtain a reinforced rubber sheet.  

![](images/5aa7ac66afbfc2792b72b072765bfb8fd1b4f83eea01f6cd05dccc580d60c825.jpg)  
FIGURE 14.16  Coating  of fabric with rubber  using a calendering  process.  

Alternatives to calendering include skimming, dipping, and spraying. In the  skimming  process, a thick solution of rubber compound in an organic solvent is  applied to the fabric as it is unreeled from a supply spool. The coated fabric passes  under a doctor blade that skims the solvent to the proper thickness, and then moves  into a steam chamber where the solvent is driven off by heat. As its name suggests,  dipping  involves temporary immersion of the fabric into a highly ﬂ  uid solution of  rubber, followed by drying. In  spraying , a spray gun is used to apply the rubber  solution.  

Molding and Casting  Molded articles include shoe soles and heels, gaskets and  seals, suction cups, and bottle stops. Many foamed rubber parts are produced by  molding. In addition, molding is an important process in tire production. Principal  molding processes for rubber are (1) compression molding, (2) transfer molding,  and (3) injection molding. Compression molding is the most important technique  because of its use in tire manufacture. Curing (vulcanizing) is accomplished in the  mold in all three processes, this representing a departure from the shaping methods  already discussed, which require a separate vulcanizing step. With injection mold- ing of rubber, there are risks of premature curing similar to those faced in the same  process when applied to thermosetting plastics. Advantages of injection molding  over traditional methods for producing rubber parts include better dimensional  control, less scrap, and shorter cycle times. In addition to its use in the molding of  conventional rubbers, injection molding is also applied for thermoplastic elastom- ers. Because of high mold costs, large production quantities are required to justify  injection molding.  

A form of casting, called  dip casting , is used for producing rubber gloves and  overshoes. It involves submersion of a positive mold in a liquid polymer (or a heated  form into plastisol) for a certain duration (the process may involve repeated dip- pings) to form the desired thickness. The coating is then stripped from the form and  cured to cross-link the rubber.  

# 14.5.4  VULCANIZATION  

Vulcanization is the treatment that accomplishes cross-linking of elastomer mol- ecules, so that the rubber becomes stiffer and stronger but retains extensibility. It  is a critical step in the rubber processing sequence. On a submicroscopic scale, the  process can be pictured as in Figure 14.17, in which the long-chain molecules of  

![](images/6be5e72653c45e94acf0058dcfb12a9d2d63bb9d8583d61e584030ca73c863d9.jpg)  
FIGURE 14.17  Effect  of vulcanization on the  rubber   molecules: (1) raw  rubber; (2)   vulcanized  (cross-linked) rubber.  Variations of (2) include  (a) soft rubber, low  degree of cross-linking;  and (b) hard rubber, high  degree of cross-linking.  

the rubber become joined at certain tie points, the effect of which is to reduce the  ability of the elastomer to ﬂ  ow. A typical soft rubber has one or two cross-links per  thousand units (mers). As the number of cross-links increases, the polymer becomes  stiffer and behaves more like a thermosetting plastic (hard rubber).  

Vulcanization, as it was ﬁ  rst invented by Charles Goodyear in 1839, involved the  use of sulfur (about 8 parts by weight of S mixed with 100 parts of natural rubber) at  a temperature of $140^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\left(280^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\right)$  for about 5 hours. No other chemicals were included  in the process. Vulcanization with sulfur alone is no longer used as a commercial  treatment today, because of the long curing times. Various other chemicals, including  zinc oxide  $(Z\mathrm{nO})$  and stearic acid  $\left(\mathrm{C_{18}H_{36}O_{2}}\right)$ , are combined with smaller doses of  sulfur to accelerate and strengthen the treatment. The resulting cure time is 15 to 20  minutes for a typical passenger car tire. In addition, various nonsulfur vulcanizing  treatments have been developed.  

In rubber-molding processes, vulcanization is accomplished in the mold by main- taining the mold temperature at the proper level for curing. In the other forming  processes, vulcanization is performed after the part has been shaped. The treatments  generally divide between batch processes and continuous processes. Batch methods  include the use of an  autoclave , a steam-heated pressure vessel; and  gas curing , in  which a heated inert gas such as nitrogen cures the rubber. Many of the basic shap- ing processes make a continuous product, and if the output is not cut into discrete  pieces, continuous vulcanization is appropriate. Continuous methods include  high- pressure steam , suited to the curing of rubber coated wire and cable;  hot-air tunnel ,  for cellular extrusions and carpet underlays [5]; and  continuous drum cure , in which  continuous rubber sheets (e.g., belts and ﬂ  ooring materials) pass through one or  more heated rolls to effect vulcanization.  

# 14.5.5  PROCESSING OF THERMOPLASTIC ELASTOMERS  

A thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) is a thermoplastic polymer that possesses the  properties of a rubber (Section 8.4.3); the term  thermoplastic rubber  is also used.  TPEs can be processed like thermoplastics, but their applications are those of an  elastomer. The most common shaping processes are injection molding and extru- sion, which are generally more economical and faster than the traditional processes  used for rubbers that must be vulcanized. Molded products include shoe soles, ath- letic footwear, and automotive components such as fender extensions and corner  panels (but not tires—TPEs have been found to be unsatisfactory for that applica- tion). Extruded items include insulation coating for electrical wire, tubing for medi- cal applications, conveyor belts, and sheet and ﬁ  lm stock. Other shaping techniques  for TPEs include blow molding and thermoforming (Sections 13.8 and 13.9); these  processes cannot be used for vulcanized rubbers.  

#    Manufacture of Tires and Other Rubber  Products  

Tires are the principal product of the rubber industry, accounting for about three- fourths of total tonnage. Other important products include footwear, hose, con- veyor belts, seals, shock-absorbing components, foamed rubber products, and sports  equipment.  

# 14.6.1  TIRES  

Pneumatic tires are critical components of the vehicles on which they are mounted.  They are used on automobiles, trucks, buses, farm tractors, earth-moving equipment,  military vehicles, bicycles, motorcycles, and aircraft. Tires support the weight of the  vehicle and the passengers and cargo on board; they transmit the motor torque to  propel the vehicle (except on aircraft); and they absorb vibrations and shock to pro- vide a comfortable ride.  

Tire Construction and Production Sequence  A tire is an assembly of many  parts, whose manufacture is unexpectedly complex. A passenger car tire consists  of about 50 individual pieces; a large earthmover tire may have as many as 175. To  begin with, there are three basic tire constructions: (a) diagonal ply, (b) belted bias,  and (c) radial ply, pictured in Figure 14.18. In all three cases, the internal structure  of the tire, known as the  carcass , consists of multiple layers of rubber-coated cords,  called  plies . The cords are strands of various materials such as nylon, polyester, ﬁ  b- erglass, and steel, which provide inextensibility to reinforce the rubber in the carcass.  The  diagonal ply tire  has the cords running diagonally, but in perpendicular direc- tions in adjacent layers. A typical diagonal ply tire may have four plies. The  belted  bias tire  is constructed of diagonal plies with opposite bias but adds several more  layers around the outside periphery of the carcass. These  belts  increase the stiffness  of the tire in the tread area and limit its diametric expansion during inﬂ  ation. The  cords in the belt also run diagonally, as indicated in the sketch.

FIGURE 14.18  Three principal tire constructions: (a) diagonal ply, (b) belted bias, and (c) radial ply.  

A  radial tire  has plies running radially rather than diagonally; it also uses belts  around the periphery for support. A  steel-belted radial  is a tire in which the circum- ferential belts have cords made of steel. The radial construction provides a more  ﬂ  exible sidewall which tends to reduce stress on the belts and treads as they con- tinually deform on contact with the ﬂ  at road surface during rotation. This effect is  accompanied by greater tread life, improved cornering and driving stability, and a  better ride at high speeds.  

In each construction, the carcass is covered by solid rubber that reaches a max- imum thickness in the tread area. The carcass is also lined on the inside with a  rubber coating. For tires with inner tubes, the inner liner is a thin coating applied  to the innermost ply during its fabrication. For tubeless tires, the inner liner must  have low permeability because it holds the air pressure; it is generally a laminated  rubber.  

Tire production can be summarized in three steps: (1) preforming of components,  (2) building the carcass and adding rubber strips to form the sidewalls and treads,  and (3) molding and curing the components into one integral piece. The descriptions  of these steps that follow are typical; there are variations in processing depending on  construction, tire size, and type of vehicle on which the tire will be used.  

Preforming of Components  As Figure 14.18 shows, the carcass consists of a  number of separate components, most of which are rubber or reinforced rubber.  These, as well as the sidewall and tread rubber, are produced by continuous proc- esses and then pre-cut to size and shape for subsequent assembly. The components,  labeled in Figure 14.18, and the preforming processes to fabricate them are:  

Bead coil . Continuous steel wire is rubber-coated, cut, coiled, and the ends  joined.

 $\gg$ Plies . Continuous fabric (textile, nylon, ﬁ  ber glass, steel) is rubber coated in a  calendering process and pre-cut to size and shape.

 $\gg$ Inner lining . For tube tires, the inner liner is calendered onto the innermost ply.  For tubeless tires, the liner is calendered as a two-layer laminate.

 $\gg$ Belts . Continuous fabric is rubber coated (similar to plies), and cut at different  angles for better reinforcement; then made into a multi-ply belt.

 $\gg$ Tread . Extruded as continuous strip; then cut and preassembled to belts.

 $\gg$ Sidewall . Extruded as continuous strip; then cut to size and shape.  

Building the Carcass  The carcass is traditionally assembled using a machine  known as a  building drum , whose main element is a cylindrical arbor that rotates.  Pre-cut strips that form the carcass are built up around this arbor in a step-by-step  procedure. The layered plies that form the cross section of the tire are anchored on  opposite sides of the rim by two bead coils. The bead coils consist of multiple strands  of high-strength steel wire. Their function is to provide a rigid support when the  ﬁ  nished tire is mounted on the wheel rim. Other components are combined with the  plies and bead coils. These include various wrappings and ﬁ  ller pieces to give the tire  the proper strength, heat resistance, air retention, and ﬁ  tting to the wheel rim. After  these parts are placed around the arbor and the proper number of plies have been  added, the belts are applied. This is followed by the outside rubber that will become

the sidewall and tread.  At this point in the process, the treads are rubber strips  of uniform cross section—the tread design is added later in molding. The building  drum is collapsible, so that the unﬁ  nished tire can be removed when ﬁ  nished. The  form of the tire at this stage is roughly tubular, as portrayed in Figure 14.19.  

Molding and Curing  Tire molds are usually two-piece construction (split molds)  and contain the tread pattern to be impressed on the tire. The mold is bolted into a  press, one half attached to the upper platen (the lid) and the bottom half fastened  to the lower platen (the base). The uncured tire is placed over an expandable dia- phragm and inserted between the mold halves, as in Figure 14.20. The press is then  closed and the diaphragm expanded, so that the soft rubber is pressed against the  cavity of the mold. This causes the tread pattern to be imparted to the rubber. At  the same time, the rubber is heated, both from the outside by the mold and from the  inside by the diaphragm. Circulating hot water or steam under pressure are used  to heat the diaphragm. The duration of this curing step depends on the thickness  of the tire wall. A typical passenger tire can be cured in about 15 minutes. Bicycle  tires cure in about 4 minutes, whereas tires for large earth moving equipment take  several hours to cure. After curing is completed, the tire is cooled and removed from  the press.

# 14.6.2  OTHER RUBBER PRODUCTS  

Most other rubber products are made by less complex processes. Rubber belts are  widely used in conveyors and mechanical power transmission systems. As with tires,  rubber is an ideal material for these products, but the belt must have ﬂ  exibility but  little or no extensibility. Accordingly, it is reinforced with ﬁ  bers, commonly polyester  or nylon. Fabrics of these polymers are usually coated in calendering operations,  assembled together to obtain the required number of plies and thickness, and subse- quently vulcanized by continuous or batch heating processes.  

Rubber hose can be either plain or reinforced. Plain hose is extruded tubing.  Reinforced tube consists of an inner tube, a reinforcing layer (sometimes called the  carcass), and a cover. The internal tubing is extruded of a rubber that has been com- pounded for the particular substance that will ﬂ  ow through it. The reinforcement  layer is applied to the tube in the form of a fabric, or by spiraling, knitting, braiding,  or other application method. The outer layer is compounded to resist environmental  conditions. It is applied by extrusion, using rollers, or other techniques.  

Footwear components include soles, heels, rubber overshoes, and certain upper  parts. Various rubbers are used to make footwear components (Section 8.4). Molded  parts are produced by injection molding, compression molding, and certain special  molding techniques developed by the shoe industry; the rubbers include both solid  and foamed varieties. In some cases, for low volume production, manual methods  are used to cut rubber from ﬂ  at stock.  

Rubber is widely used in sports equipment and supplies, including ping pong  paddle surfaces, golf club grips, football bladders, and sports balls of various kinds.  Tennis balls, for example, are made in signiﬁ  cant numbers. Production of these sports  products relies on the various shaping processes discussed in Section 14.5.3, as well  as special techniques that have been developed for particular items.

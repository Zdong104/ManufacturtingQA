For techno-  logical and economic reasons, manufacturing is impor-  tant to the welfare of the United States and most other  developed and developing nations.  Technology  can be  defined as the application of science to provide society  and its members with those things that are needed or  desired. Technology affects our daily lives, directly and  indirectly, in many ways. Consider the list of products in  Table 1.1. They represent various technologies that help  our  society and its members to live better. What do all these  products have in common? They are all manufac-  tured.  These technological wonders would not be avail-  able to  our society if they could not be manufactured.  Manufacturing is the critical factor that makes technol-  ogy possible.   "

It  marked the change from an economy based on agri-  culture and handicraft to one based on industry and  manufacturing. The change began in England, where a  series of machines were invented and steam power  replaced water, wind, and animal power. These ad-  vances gave British industry significant advantages  over other nations, and England attempted to restrict  export of the new technologies. However, the revo-  lution eventually spread to other European countries  and the United States. Several inventions of the Indus-  trial Revolution greatly contributed to the development  of manufacturing: (1)  Watt’s steam engine —a new  power-generating technology for industry; (2)  machine  tools , starting with John Wilkinson’s boring machine  around 1775 (Historical Note 21.1); (3) the  spinning  jenny, power loom , and other machinery for the tex-  tile industry that permitted significant increases in  productivity; and (4) the  factory system —a new way  of organizing large numbers of production workers  based on division of labor.

Much credit for this concept is given to Eli Whitney  (1765–1825), although its importance had been rec-  ognized by others [10]. In 1797, Whitney negotiated  a contract to produce 10,000 muskets for the U.S.  government. The traditional way of making guns at the  time was to custom-fabricate each part for a par- ticular  gun and then hand-fit the parts together by fil- ing.  Each musket was unique, and the time to make it was  considerable. Whitney believed that the com- ponents  could be made accurately enough to permit parts  assembly without fitting. After several years of  development in his Connecticut factory, he traveled to  Washington in 1801 to demonstrate the principle.  He laid out components for 10 muskets before gov-  ernment officials, including Thomas Jefferson, and  proceeded to select parts randomly to assemble the  guns. No special filing or fitting was required, and  all of the guns worked perfectly. The secret be- hind his  achievement was the collection of special machines,  fixtures, and gages that he had developed in  his  factory. Interchangeable parts manufacture   "

A plant with a given set of processes is limited in  terms of the size and weight of the products that can be accommodated. Large,  heavy products are difficult to move. To move these products about, the plant must  be equipped with cranes of the required load capacity. Smaller parts and products  made in large quantities can be moved by conveyor or other means. The limitation  on product size and weight extends to the physical capacity of the manufacturing  equipment as well. Production machines come in different sizes. Larger machines  must be used to process larger parts. The production and material handling equip-  ment must be planned for products that lie within a certain size and weight range.   "

A  processing operation  transforms a work material from one state of completion to  a more advanced state that is closer to the final desired product. It adds value by  changing the geometry, properties, or appearance of the starting material. In general,  processing operations are performed on discrete work parts, but certain processing  operations are also applicable to assembled items (e.g., painting a spot-welded car  body).

Certain shaping processes are more efficient than others in terms  of material conservation. Material removal processes (e.g., machining) tend to be  wasteful of material, simply by the way they work. The material removed from the  starting  shape is waste, at least in terms of the unit operation. Other processes, such as certain  casting and molding operations, often convert close to $100\\%$  of the start-  ing material  into final product. Manufacturing processes that transform nearly all of  the starting  material into product and require no subsequent machining to achieve final part  geometry are called  net shape processes .

The automobile industry, in  particular, is designing its final assembly lines so that ever-greater model variations  can be accommodated on a single line to meet changing and unpredictable demand  patterns.

This has enabled a freer flow  of goods and services, capital, technology, and people among regions and countries.  Globalization is the term that describes this trend, which was recognized in the late  1980s and is now a dominant economic reality. Of interest here is that once under-  developed nations such as China, India, and Mexico have developed their manufac-  turing infrastructures and technologies to a level such that they are now important  producers in the global economy. These countries have large populations, and there-  fore large workforces, and low labor costs. Hourly wages are significantly higher  in the United States than in these countries, making it difficult for domestic U.S.  companies to compete in many products that require high labor content. Examples  include garments, furniture, toys, and electronic consumer products. The result has  been a loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States and a gain of related work to  these countries.

Two possibilities can be distinguished: (1)  offshore outsourcing , which  refers to production in China or other overseas locations and transporting the items  by cargo ship to the United States, and (2)  near-shore outsourcing , which means the  items  are made in Canada, Mexico, or Central America and shipped by rail or truck into  the United States.

Contract manufacturers have developed expertise and efficiencies in cer-  tain manufacturing operations, which means they can likely produce the contracted  items at prices that are lower than the production costs of the customer company if  it were the producer. Contract manufacturers include both domestic (U.S.) and  foreign companies. Reasons why a company might prefer to use the services of a  contract manufacturer include: (1) the company benefits from cost savings because  it does not have to pay the factory expenses associated with production, (2) the  company can focus its resources on design and marketing of products rather than  manufacturing, and (3) the company may benefit from skills possessed by the con-  tract manufacturer but not by itself. On the other hand, there are risks associated  with contract manufacturing by the customer company. In turning over its prod-  uct designs it loses control over its intellectual property, which might result in the  contract manufacturer becoming a competitor. The distinction between a contract  manufacturer and a supplier is perhaps subtle. A  supplier  is usually thought of as a  company that provides materials and components for a customer who is engaged in  production of a product, whereas a contract manufacturer accomplishes the whole  production of the product. It may use suppliers itself.   "

To take advan- tage  of the low labor rates, many U.S. companies have moved much of their production  to  China (and other east Asian countries). Despite the logistics problems and costs of  shipping the goods back into the United States, the result has been lower costs and  higher profits for the outsourcing companies, as well as lower prices and a wider  variety of available products for American consumers. The downside has been the loss  of well-paying manufacturing jobs in the United States. Another consequence of U.S.  outsourcing to China has been a reduction in the relative contribution of the manufac-  turing sector to GDP. In the 1990s, the manufacturing industries accounted for about  $20\\%$  of GDP in the United States. Today, that contribution is only about  $12\\%$ . At the  same time, the manufacturing sector in China has grown (along with the rest of its  economy), now accounting for about $35\\%$  of Chinese GDP.   "

First, wage rates in China are increasing as the  government attempts to evolve from an export-driven economy  to a consumer-oriented economy, similar to the United States.  Higher Chinese wage rates mean less advantage for U.S.  compa- nies to offshore jobs to China. Second, logistics costs  and delays involved in trans-  porting products from China to North  America are significant, especially as oil prices  increase.  Accordingly, some companies, in their analyses of costs and  benefits, have decided to produce in the United States, re- opening old factories or building new  ones. On the other hand,  U.S. companies producing goods for the Chinese market still have  good reasons to keep their operations going in that country, just as  Japanese and  German automobile makers have established  plants in the United States.

The most obvious examples are material removal  processes, in which chips are removed from a starting  workpiece to create the desired part geometry. Waste in one  form or another is a by-product of nearly all production  operations. Another unavoidable aspect of manufacturing is  that power is required to accomplish any given process.  Generating that power requires fossil fuels (at least in the  United States and China), the burning of which results in  pollution of the environment. At the end of the manufacturing  sequence, a product is created that is sold to a customer.  Ultimately, the product wears out and is disposed of, perhaps in  some landfill, with the associated environmental degrada- tion.  More and more attention is being paid by society to the  environmental impact of human activities throughout the world  and how modern civilization is using our natural resources at an  unsustainable rate.

The number of these  slip directions  de-  pends on the lattice type. The three common metal crystal structures are somewhat  more complicated, especially in three dimensions, than the square lattice depicted in  Figure  2.11. It turns out that HCP has the fewest slip directions, BCC the most, and FCC  falls in between. HCP metals show poor ductility and are generally difficult to  deform at room temperature. Metals with BCC structure would figure to have the  highest ductility, if the number of slip directions were the only criterion. However,  nature is not so simple. These metals are generally stronger than the others, which  complicates the issue, and the BCC metals usually require higher stresses to cause  slip. In fact, some of the BCC metals exhibit poor ductility. Low carbon steel is a  notable exception; although relatively strong, it is widely used with great commer-  cial success in sheet-metal-forming operations, where it exhibits good ductility. The  FCC metals are generally the most ductile of the three crystal structures, combining  a good number of slip directions with (usually) relatively low to moderate strength.

When a lattice  structure containing an edge dislocation is subjected to a shear stress, the material  deforms much more readily than in a perfect structure. This is explained by the fact  that the dislocation is put into motion within the crystal lattice in the presence of the  stress, as shown in the series of sketches in Figure 2.12. Why is it easier to move a dis-  location through the lattice than it is to deform the lattice itself? The answer is that  the atoms at the edge dislocation require a smaller displacement within the distorted  lattice  structure to reach a new equilibrium position. Thus, a lower energy level is needed  to realign the atoms into the new positions than if the lattice were missing the  dislocation. A lower stress level is therefore required to effect the deformation.  Because the new position manifests a similar distorted lattice, movement of atoms  at the dislocation continues at the lower stress level.   "

It is illustrated in Figure 2.13. The mechanism is important in HCP  metals  (e.g., magnesium, zinc) because they do not slip readily. Besides structure, another  factor in twinning is the rate of deformation. The slip mechanism requires more  time than twinning, which can occur almost instantaneously. Thus, when the  deformation rate is very high, metals twin that would otherwise slip. Low carbon  steel is an example that illustrates this rate sensitivity; when subjected to high strain  rates it twins, whereas at moderate rates it deforms by slip.   "

As  these crystals grow they finally interfere with each other, forming at their interface a  surface defect—a  grain boundary . The grain boundary consists of a transition zone,  perhaps only a few atoms thick, in which the atoms are not aligned with either grain.  The size of the grains in the metal block is determined by the number of nucleation  sites in the molten material and the cooling rate of the mass, among other factors.

However, there are variations in the manu- facturing  process, which are manifested as variations in the part size. Tolerances are used to  define the limits of the allowed variation.

Figure 5.14 presents most of the  possible lays a surface can take, together with the symbol used by a designer to specify  them. Finally,  flaws  are irregularities that occur occasionally on the sur- face; these  include cracks, scratches, inclusions, and similar defects in the surface. Although some  of the flaws relate to surface texture, they also affect surface integrity (Section 5.3.3).   "

Applying the same procedure used in the example, the  composition of the solid metal is  $50\\%$  nickel, and the composition of the last remain-  ing liquid to freeze is about  $26\\%$  nickel. How is it, the reader might ask, that the  last ounce of molten metal has a composition so different from the solid metal into  which it freezes? The answer is that the phase diagram assumes equilibrium condi-  tions are allowed to prevail. In fact, the binary phase diagram is sometimes called an  equilibrium diagram because of this assumption. What it means is that enough time  is permitted for the solid metal to gradually change its composition by diffusion to  achieve the composition indicated by the intersection point along the liquidus. In  practice, when an alloy freezes (e.g., a casting),  segregation  occurs in the solid mass  because of nonequilibrium conditions. The first liquid to solidify has a composition  that is rich in the metal element with the higher melting point. Then as additional  metal solidifies, its composition is different from that of the first metal to freeze.  As the nucleation sites grow into a solid mass, compositions are distributed within  the mass, depending on the temperature and time in the process at which freezing  occurred. The overall composition is the average of the distribution.   "

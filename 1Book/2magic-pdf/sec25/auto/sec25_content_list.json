        "text": "Photochemical Machining   Photochemical machining (PCM) is chemical machin- ing in which the photoresist method of masking is used. The term can therefore be  applied correctly to chemical blanking and chemical engraving when these methods  use the photographic resist method. PCM is employed in metalworking when close  tolerances and/or intricate patterns are required on ﬂ  at parts. Photochemical processes  are also used extensively in the electronics industry to produce intricate circuit designs  on semiconductor wafers (Section 33.3). Figure 25.19 shows several parts produced by  photochemical blanking and photochemical engraving. "

There are various ways to photographically expose  the desired image onto the resist. The ﬁ  gure shows the negative in contact with the  surface of the resist during exposure. This is contact printing, but other photo  graphic  printing methods are available that expose the negative through a lens system to  enlarge or reduce the size of the pattern printed on the resist surface. Photoresist  materials in current use are sensitive to ultraviolet light but not to light of other  wavelengths. Therefore, with proper lighting in the factory, there is no need to carry  out the processing steps in a dark room environment. Once the masking operation is  accomplished, the remaining steps in the procedure are similar to the other chemical  machining methods. "

        "text": "Performance of Nontraditional Processes   The nontraditional processes are  generally characterized by low material removal rates and high speciﬁ  c energies  relative to conventional machining operations. The capabilities for dimensional  control and surface ﬁ  nish of the nontraditional processes vary widely, with some  of the processes providing high accuracies and good ﬁ  nishes, and others yield- ing poor accuracies and ﬁ  nishes. Surface damage is also a consideration. Some  of these processes produce very little metallurgical damage at and immediately  below the work surface, whereas others (mostly the thermal-based processes) do  considerable damage to the surface. Table 25.6 compares these features of the  prominent nontraditional methods, using conventional milling and surface grind- ing for comparison. Inspection of the data reveals wide differences in machining  characteristics. In comparing the characteristics of nontraditional and conven- tional machining, it must be remembered that nontraditional processes are gener- ally used where conventional methods are not practical or economical.

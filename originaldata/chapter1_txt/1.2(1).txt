Materials in Manufacturing
Most engineering materials can be classiﬁ  ed into one of three basic categories: 
(1) metals, (2) ceramics, and (3) polymers. Their chemistries are different, their 
mechanical and physical properties are different, and these differences affect the 
manufacturing processes that can be used to produce products from them. In addi-
tion to the three basic categories, there are (4) composites —nonhomogeneous mix-
tures of the other three basic types rather than a unique category. The classiﬁ  cation 
of the four groups is pictured in Figure 1.4. This section provides a survey of these 
materials. Chapters 6 through 9 cover the four material types in more detail.

PRODUCTION CYCLE TIME ANALYSIS
“Time is money”, as the saying goes. The total time to make a product is one of the 
components that determine its total cost and the price that can be charged for it. The 
total time is the sum of all of the individual cycle times of the unit operations needed 
to manufacture the product. As deﬁ  ned in Section 1.3, a unit operation is a single step 
in the sequence of steps required to make the ﬁ  nal product. The cycle time  of a unit 
operation is deﬁ  ned as the time that one work unit spends being processed or assem-
bled. It is the time interval between when one work unit begins the operation and 
the next unit begins. A typical production cycle time consists of the actual processing 
time plus the work handling time, for example, loading and unloading the part in the 
machine. In some processes, such as machining, time is also required to periodically 
change the tooling used in the operation when it wears out. In equation form,
Tc /H11005 To /H11001 Th /H11001 Tt (1.1)
where Tc /H11005 cycle time of the unit operation, min/pc; To /H11005 actual processing time in 
the operation, min/pc; Th /H11005 work handling time, min/pc; and Tt /H11005 tool handling time 
if that applies in the operation, min/pc. As indicated, the tool handling time usually 
 occurs periodically, not every cycle, so the time per workpiece must be determined 
by dividing the actual time associated with changing the tool by the number of pieces 1.5

between tool changes. It should be mentioned that many production operations do 
not include a tool change, so that term is omitted from Equation (1.1) in those cases.
Batch and job shop production are common types of manufacturing. The time 
to produce a batch of parts in a unit operation consists of the time to set up for the 
batch plus the actual run time. This can be summarized as follows:
 Tb /H11005 Tsu /H11001 QTc (1.2)
where Tb /H11005 total time to complete the batch, min/batch; Tsu /H11005 setup time, min/batch; 
Q /H11005 batch quantity, number of pieces (pc); and Tc /H11005 cycle time as deﬁ  ned in Equa-
tion (1.1), min/pc. To obtain a realistic value of the average production time per 
piece, the setup time is spread over the batch quantity, as follows:
 Tp /H11005   Tsu ___ Q   /H11001 Tc /H11005   Tsu /H11001 QTc _________  Q   /H11005   Tb ___ Q   (1.3)
where Tp /H11005 average production time per piece, min/pc; and the other terms are de-
ﬁ ned above.
If the batch size is one part, then Equations (1.2) and (1.3) are still applicable, and 
Q /H11005 1. In high production (mass production), these equations can also be used, but 
the value of Q is so large that the setup time loses signiﬁ  cance: As Q → /H11009, Tsu/H20907Q → 0. 
The average production time per piece in Equation (1.3) can be used to deter-
mine the actual average production rate in the operation:
 Rp /H11005   60 ___ Tp   (1.4)
where Rp /H11005 average hourly production rate, pc/hr. This production rate includes the 
effect of setup time. During the production run (after the machine is set up), the 
production rate is the reciprocal of the cycle time:
 Rc /H11005   60 ___ Tc   (1.5)
where Rc /H11005 hourly cycle rate, cycles/hr or pc/hr. These equations indicate that the 
cycle rate will always be larger than the actual production rate unless the setup time 
is zero ( Rc /H11350 Rp).

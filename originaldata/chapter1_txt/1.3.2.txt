ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS
The second basic type of manufacturing operation is assembly , in which two or more 
separate parts are joined to form a new entity. Components of the new entity are 
connected either permanently or semipermanently. Permanent joining processes 
include welding , brazing , soldering , and adhesive bonding . They form a joint be-
tween components that cannot be easily disconnected. Certain mechanical assem-
bly methods are available to fasten two (or more) parts together in a joint that can 
be conveniently disassembled. The use of screws, bolts, and other threaded fasten-
ers are important traditional methods in this category. Other mechanical assembly 
techniques form a more permanent connection; these include rivets , press ﬁ  tting , 
and expansion ﬁ  ts. Special joining and fastening methods are used in the assembly 
of electronic products. Some of the methods are identical to or are adaptations of 
the preceding processes, for example, soldering. Electronics assembly is concerned 
primarily with the assembly of components such as integrated circuit packages to 
printed circuit boards to produce the complex circuits used in so many of today’s 
products. Joining and assembly processes are discussed in Part VIII, and the special-
ized assembly techniques for electronics are described in Chapter 34.

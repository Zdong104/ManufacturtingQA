MANUFACTURING SUPPORT SYSTEMS
To operate its facilities efﬁ  ciently, a company must organize itself to design the proc-
esses and equipment, plan and control the production orders, and satisfy product 
quality requirements. These functions are accomplished by manufacturing sup-
port systems—people and procedures by which a company manages its production

 operations. Most of these support systems do not directly contact the product, but 
they plan and control its progress through the factory. Manufacturing support func-
tions are often carried out in the ﬁ  rm by people organized into departments such as 
the following:
 /uni27A2Manufacturing engineering. The manufacturing engineering department is re-
sponsible for planning the manufacturing processes—deciding what processes 
should be used to make the parts and assemble the products. This department is 
also involved in designing and ordering the machine tools and other equipment 
used by the operating departments to accomplish processing and assembly.
 /uni27A2Production planning and control. This department is responsible for solv-
ing the logistics problem in manufacturing—ordering materials and purchased 
parts, scheduling production, and making sure that the operating departments 
have the necessary capacity to meet the production schedules.
 /uni27A2Quality control. Producing high-quality products should be a top priority of any 
manufacturing ﬁ  rm in today’s competitive environment. It means designing and 
building products that conform to speciﬁ  cations and satisfy or exceed customer 
expectations. Much of this effort is the responsibility of the QC department.

Recent Developments in Manufacturing
Manufacturing materials, processes, and systems have been the object of devel-
opment for thousands of years (Historical Notes 1.1 and 1.2). In this section, we 
want to focus on developments that are of more recent vintage, say within the 
last 25 to 50 years. The discussion is organized around the following topic areas: 
(1) microelectronics, (2) computerization of manufacturing, (3) ﬂ  exible manufactur-
ing, (4) microfabrication and nanotechnology, (5) lean production and Six Sigma, 
(6) globalization, and (7) environmentally conscious manufacturing. 
Microelectronics  Microelectronics involves electronic devices that are fabri-
cated on a microscopic scale. Examples include integ rated circuits , which consist of 
components such as transistors, diodes, and resistors that have been fabricated and 
electrically connected on a small ﬂ  at chip, usually made of silicon. The remarkable 
feature about today’s microelectronics devices is the huge number of components 
that can be contained onto the chip. The capability to fabricate integrated circuits 
dates from the early 1960s and has advanced to the point where the current technol-
ogy is called giga-scale integration , meaning that chips are being produced consist-
ing of billions of components. Microelectronics has become so pervasive that a large 1.6
A high-production operation manufactures a part for the automotive indus-
try. Starting material cost /H11005 $1.75, and cycle time /H11005 2.20 min. Equipment cost 
rate /H11005 $42.00/hr, and labor cost rate /H11005 $24.00/hr, including overhead costs in 
both cases. Availability of the production machine in this job /H11005 97%, and the 
scrap rate of parts produced /H11005 5%. Because this is a long-running job, setup 
time is ignored, and there is no tooling cost to be considered. (a) Determine 
the production rate and ﬁ  nished part cost in this operation. (b) If availability 
could be increased to 100% and scrap rate could be reduced to 0, what would 
be the production rate and ﬁ  nished part cost?
Solution : (a) Production rate, including effect of availability 
Rp /H11005   60 ____ 2.20   (0.97) /H11005 26.45 pc/hr
However, because of the 5% scrap rate, the production rate of acceptable 
parts is
Rp /H11005 26.45(1 /H11002 0.05) /H11005 25.13 pc/hr
Because of availability and scrap rate, the part cost is
Cpc /H11005   1.75 _________  (1 /H11002 0.05)   /H11001   (24 /H11001 42) _________  (0.97)    (   2.20 ___________   60(1 /H11002 0.05)   )  /H11005 $4.47/pc
(b) If A /H11005 100% and q /H11005 0, Rp /H11005   60 ____ 2.20   /H11005 27.27 pc/hr .
Part cost Cpc /H11005 1.75 /H11001 (42 /H11001 24)(2.20/60) /H11005 $4.17/pc .
This is an 8.5% increase in production rate and a 6.7% reduction in cost.Example 1.4

proportion of the common items used today are based on this technology. Two thirds 
of the products listed in Table 1.1 are either called electronics products or their func-
tion and operation depend on electronics. In this book, the fabrication of integrated 
circuits is covered in Chapter 33 and electronics assembly in Chapter 34. 
Computerization of Manufacturing  The ﬁ  rst digital computers date from the 
mid-1940s, but their applications in manufacturing came quite a few years later.  In 
the mid-1960s direct numerical control was developed, in which mainframe com-
puters were employed to remotely control machine tools in factories. As computer 
technology developed, enabled by advances in microelectronics, the cost of comput-
ers and data processing was reduced, leading to the widespread use of personal com-
puters, not only in the ofﬁ  ce but also in the factory for tasks ranging from control 
of individual equipment on the shop ﬂ  oor to control of the information required to 
manage the entire enterprise. The Internet has allowed manufacturing companies to 
communicate among their own geographically distributed plants and ofﬁ  ces, and it 
has also provided access to customers and suppliers around the world. In this book, 
several aspects of computerization of manufacturing are included in Parts X and XI 
on manufacturing systems (Chapters 37 and 38) and manufacturing support systems 
(Chapters 39 and 40).
Flexible Manufacturing  During most of the twentieth century, the emphasis in 
the manufacturing industries in the United States was on mass production to sat-
isfy the consumer demands of a rapidly growing population. Mass production is still 
widely used in the United States and throughout the world, but computerization has 
enabled manufacturing companies to develop systems that are able to cope with 
product variations. The reader encountered several instances of this manufacturing 
ﬂ exibility in Section 1.4.1 in the discussion of production facilities. Cellular manu-
facturing and mixed-model assembly lines are two examples of manually operated 
manufacturing systems that are capable of producing a variety of parts or products 
without the time-consuming downtime for changeover. The automobile industry, in 
particular, is designing its ﬁ  nal assembly lines so that ever-greater model variations 
can be accommodated on a single line to meet changing and unpredictable demand 
patterns. Computerization has also allowed ﬂ  exibility to be designed into automated 
systems, examples of which are the ﬂ  exible manufacturing systems discussed in Sec-
tion 38.6. 
Closely related to ﬂ  exible manufacturing is mass customization , which involves 
a production system that is capable of producing individualized products for each 
customer. The customer speciﬁ  es the model and options, and the product is made to 
those speciﬁ  cations. Mass customization is discussed in Section 38.6.3.
Microfabrication and Nanotechnology  Another recent development in manu-
facturing, closely related to microelectronics, is the introduction of materials and 
products whose dimensions are sometimes so small that they cannot be seen by the 
naked eye . In extreme cases, the items cannot even be seen under an optical micro-
scope. Products that are so miniaturized require special fabrication technologies. 
Microfabrication  refers to the processes needed to make parts and products whose 
features sizes are in the micrometer range (1 mm /H11005 10/H110023 mm /H11005 10/H110026m). Examples 
include ink-jet printing heads, compact discs (CDs and DVDs), and microsensors 
used in automotive applications (e.g., air-bag deployment sensors). Nanotechnol-
ogy refers to materials and products whose feature sizes are in the nanometer scale

(1 nm /H11005 10/H110023 mm /H11005 10/H110026 mm /H11005 10/H110029m), a scale that approaches the size of atoms and 
molecules. Ultra-thin coatings for catalytic converters, ﬂ  at screen TV monitors, and 
cancer drugs are examples of products based on nanotechnology. The technological 
and economic importance of microscopic and nanoscopic materials and products is 
expected to increase in the future, and processes are needed to produce them com-
mercially. Chapters 35 and 36 are devoted to these technologies.
Lean Production and Six Sigma  These are two programs aimed at improving 
efﬁ ciency and quality in manufacturing. They address demands by customers for 
products they buy to be both low in cost and high in quality. Lean production and 
Six Sigma are being widely adopted by companies, especially in the United States. 
Lean production is based on the Toyota Production System developed by Toyota 
Motors in Japan. Its origins date from the 1950s and 1960s when Toyota began using 
unconventional approaches to improve quality, reduce inventories, and increase 
ﬂ exibility in its operations. Lean production  can be deﬁ  ned simply as “doing more 
work with fewer resources.”4 It means that fewer workers and less equipment are 
used to accomplish more production in less time, and yet achieve higher quality in 
the ﬁ  nal product. The underlying objective of lean production is the elimination of 
various forms of waste, such as producing defective parts, excessive inventories, and 
workers waiting. Lean production is described in Sections 39.4 and 39.5 in our chap-
ter on process planning and production control.
Six Sigma was started in the 1980s at Motorola Corporation in the United States. 
The objective was to reduce variability in the company’s processes and products to 
increase customer satisfaction. Today, Six Sigma  can be deﬁ  ned as “a quality-focused 
program that utilizes worker teams to accomplish projects aimed at improving an 
organization’s operational performance.”5 Six Sigma is discussed in more detail in 
Section 40.4.2.
Globalization and Outsourcing  The world is becoming more and more inte-
grated, creating an international economy in which barriers once established by 
national boundaries have been reduced or eliminated. This has enabled a freer ﬂ  ow 
of goods and services , capital, technology, and people among regions and countries. 
Globalization is the term that describes this trend, which was recognized in the late 
1980s and is now a dominant economic reality. Of interest here is that once under-
developed nations such as China, India, and Mexico have developed their manufac-
turing infrastructures and technologies to a level such that they are now important 
producers in the global economy. These countries have large populations, and there-
fore large workforces, and low labor costs. Hourly wages are signiﬁ  cantly higher 
in the United States than in these countries, making it difﬁ  cult for domestic U.S. 
companies to compete in many products that require high labor content. Examples 
include garments, furniture, toys, and electronic consumer products. The result has 
been a loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States and a gain of related work to 
these countries. 
Outsourcing is closely related to globalization. In manufacturing, outsourc-
ing refers to the use of outside contractors to perform work that was traditionally

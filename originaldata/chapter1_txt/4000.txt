cost rateEquipment Cost Rate  The cost of production equipment used in the factory is a 
ﬁ  xed cost , meaning that it remains constant for any level of production output. It is 
a capital investment that is made in the hope that it will pay for itself by producing 
a revenue stream that ultimately exceeds its cost.  The company puts up the money 
to purchase the equipment as an initial cost, and then the equipment pays back over 
a certain number of years until it is replaced or disposed of. This is different from 
direct labor and material costs, which are variable costs , meaning they are paid for 
as they are used. Direct labor cost is a cost per time ($/min), and Material cost is a 
cost per piece ($/pc). 
In order to determine an equipment cost rate, the initial cost plus installation cost 
of the equipment must be amortized over the number of minutes it is used during its 
lifetime. The equipment cost rate is deﬁ  ned by the following:
 Ceq /H11005   IC ______ 60NH   (1 /H11001 ROH) (1.8)
where Ceq /H11005 equipment cost rate, $/min; IC /H11005 initial cost of the equipment, $; N /H11005 
anticipated number of years of service; H /H11005 annual number of hours of operation, 
hr/yr; and ROH /H11005 applicable overhead rate for the equipment, %. 
The production machine in Example 1.1 is used to produce a batch of parts 
that each has a starting material cost /H11005 $2.35. Batch quantity /H11005 100. The actual 
processing time in the operation /H11005 3.72 min. Time to load and unload each 
workpiece /H11005 1.60 min. Tool cost /H11005 $4.40, and each tool can be used for 20 
pieces before it is changed, which takes 2.0 min. Before production can begin, 
the machine must be set up, which takes 2.5 hr. Hourly wage rate of the opera-
tor /H11005 $16.50/hr, and the applicable labor overhead rate /H11005 40%. Determine (a) 
the cycle time for the piece, (b) average production rate when setup time is 
ﬁ  gured in, and (c) cost per piece.
Solution: (a) For Equation (1.1), processing time To /H11005 3.72 min, part handling 
time Th /H11005 1.50 min, and tool handling time Tt /H11005 2.00 min/20 /H11005 0.10 min.

Equipment reliability and scrap rate of parts are sometimes issues in produc-
tion. Equipment reliability is represented by the term availability  (denoted by the 
symbol A), which is simply the proportion uptime of the equipment. For example, if 
A /H11005 97%, then for every 100 hours of machine operation, we would expect on aver-
age that the machine would be running for 97 hours and be down for maintenance 
and repairs for 3 hours. Scrap rate refers to the proportion of parts produced that 
are defective. Let q denote the scrap rate. In batch production, more than the speci-
ﬁ ed batch quantity are often produced to compensate for the losses due to scrap. 
Let Q /H11005 the required quantity of parts to be delivered and Qo /H11005 the starting quan-
tity. The following equation can be used to determine how many starting parts are 
needed on average to satisfy an order for Q ﬁ nished parts:
Qo /H11005   Q _____ 1 /H11002 q   (1.9)
(b) The average production time per piece including the effect of setup time is
Tp /H11005   2.5(60) _______  100   /H11001 5.42 /H11005 6.92 min/pc
Hourly production rate is the reciprocal of Tp, correcting for time units:
Rp /H11005   60 ____ 6.92   /H11005 8.67 pc/hr
(c) The equipment cost rate from Example 1.1 is Ceq /H11005 $0.402/min ($24.11/hr). 
The labor rate is calculated as follows:
CL /H11005   16.50 _____ 60   (1 /H11001 0.40) /H11005 $0.385/min ($23.10/hr)
Cost of tooling Ct /H11005 4.40/20 /H11005 $0.22/pc
Finally, cost per piece is calculated as
Cpc /H11005 2.35 /H11001 (0.385 /H11001 0.402)(6.92) /H11001 0.22 /H11005 $8.02/pc
A customer has ordered a batch of 1,000 parts to be produced by a machine 
shop. Historical data indicates that the scrap rate on this type of part /H11005 4%. 
How many parts should the machine shop plan to make in order to account 
for this scrap rate?
Solution : Given Q /H11005 1,000 parts and q /H11005 4% /H11005 0.04, then the starting quan-
tity is determined as follows:
Qo /H11005   1000 ________ 1 /H11002 0.04   /H11005   1000 _____ 0.96   /H11005 1041.7 rounded to 1042 starting partsExample 1.3 
Scrap rate
Of course, in modern manufacturing practice, every effort is made to minimize scrap 
rate, with the goal being zero defects. Availability and scrap rate also ﬁ  gure into cal-
culations of production rate and part cost, as demonstrated in Example 1.4.

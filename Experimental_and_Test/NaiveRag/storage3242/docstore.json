(or more) parts together. In most cases, the method involves the use of discrete hardware components, called fasteners, that are added to the parts during the assembly operation. In other cases, the method involves the shaping or reshaping of one of the components being assembled, and no separate fasteners are required. Many consumer products are produced using mechanical assembly: automobiles, large and small appliances, telephones, furniture, utensils\u2014even wearing apparel is \u2018\u2018assembled\u2019\u2019 by mechanical means. In addition, industrial products such as airplanes, machine tools, and construction equipment almost always involve mechanical assembly. \rMechanical fastening methods can be divided into two major classes: (1) those that allow for disassembly, and \r(2) those that create a permanent joint. Threaded fasteners (e.g., screws, bolts, and nuts) are examples of the first class, and rivets illustrate the second. There are good reasons why mechanical assembly is often preferred over other joining processes discussed in previous chapters. The main reasons are (1) ease of assembly and (2) ease of disassembly (for the fastening methods that permit disassembly). \rMechanical assembly is usually accomplished by unskilled workers with a minimum of special tooling and in a relatively short time. The technology is simple, and the results are easily inspected. These factors are advantageous not only in the factory, but also during field installation. Large products that are too big and heavy to be transported completely assembled can be shipped in smaller subassemblies and then put together at the customer\u2019s site. \rEase of disassembly applies, of course, only to the mechanical fastening methods that permit disassembly. Periodic disassembly is required for many products so that maintenance and repair can be performed; for example, to replace worn-out components, make adjustments, and so forth. Permanent joining techniques such as welding do not allow for disassembly. \r\r766 \rFor purposes of organization, we divide mechanical assembly methods into the following categories: (1) threaded fasteners, (2) rivets, (3) interference fits, (4) other mechanical fastening methods, and (5) molded-in inserts and integral fasteners. These categories are described in Sections 32.1 through 32.5. In Section 32.6, we discuss an important issue in assembly: design for assembly. Assembly of electronic products includes mechanical techniques. However, electronics assembly represents a unique and specialized field, which is covered in Chapter 35. \r\r\rThreaded fasteners are discrete hardware components that have external or internal threads for assembly of parts. In nearly all cases, they permit disassembly. Threaded fasteners are the most important category of mechanical assembly; the common threaded fastener types are screws, bolts, and nuts. \r\r\r\r\r32.1.1 SCREWS, BOLTS, AND NUTS \rScrews and bolts are threaded fasteners that have external threads. There is a technical distinction between a screw and a bolt that is often blurred in popular usage. A screw is an externally threaded fastener that is generally assembled into a blind threaded hole. Some types, called self-tapping screws, possess geometries that permit them to form or cut the matching threads in the hole. A bolt is an externally threaded fastener that is inserted through holes in the parts and \u2018\u2018screwed\u2019\u2019 into a nut on the opposite side. A nut is an internally threaded fastener having standard threads that match those on bolts of the same diameter, pitch, and thread form. The typical assemblies that result from the use of screws and bolts are illustrated in Figure 32.1. \rScrews and bolts come in a variety of standard sizes, threads, and shapes.

Table 32.1 provides a selection of common threaded fastener sizes in metric units (ISO standard) and U.S. customary units (ANSI standard). (ISO is the abbreviation for the International Standards Organization. ANSI is the abbreviation for the American National Standards Institute.) \rThe metric specification consists of the nominal major diameter, mm, followed by the pitch, mm. For example, a specification of 4-0.7 means a 4.0-mm major diameter and a pitch of 0.7 mm. The U.S. standard specifies either a number designating the major diameter (up to 0.2160 in) or the nominal major diameter, in, followed by the number of threads per inch.

The types include machine screws, capscrews, setscrews, and self-tapping screws. Machine screws are the generic type, designed for assembly into tapped holes. They are sometimes assembled to nuts, and in this usage they overlap with bolts. Capscrews have the same geometry as machine screws but are made of higher strength metals and to closer tolerances. Setscrews are hardened and designed for assembly functions such as fastening collars, gears, and pulleys to shafts as shown in Figure 32.3(a). They come in various geometries, some of which are illustrated in Figure 32.3(b). A self-tapping screw (also called a tapping screw) is designed to form or cut threads in a preexisting hole into which it is being turned. Figure 32.4 shows two of the typical thread geometries for self-tapping screws. \r\r\r\r(a) thread-forming and (b) thread-cutting. \rMost threaded fasteners are produced by cold forming (Section 19.2). Some are machined (Sections 22.2.2, 22.3.2, and 22.7.1), but this is usually a more expensive thread-making process. A variety of materials are used to make threaded fasteners, steels being the most common because of their good strength and low cost. These include low and medium carbon as well as alloy steels. Fasteners made of steel are usually plated or coated for superficial resistance to corrosion. Nickel, chromium, zinc, black oxide, and similar coatings are used for this purpose. When corrosion or other factors deny the use of steel fasteners, other materials must be used, including stainless steels, aluminum alloys, nickel alloys, and plastics (however, plastics are suited to low stress applications only). \r\r\r32.1.2 OTHER THREADED FASTENERS AND RELATED HARDWARE \rAdditional threaded fasteners and related hardware include studs, screw thread inserts, captive threaded fasteners, and washers. A stud (in the context of fasteners) is an externally threaded fastener, but without the usual head possessed by a bolt. Studs can be used to assemble two parts using two nuts as shown in Figure 32.5(a). They are available with threads on one end or both as in Figure 32.5(b) and (c). \r\r\rFIGURE 32.6 Screw thread inserts: (a) before insertion, and (b) after insertion into hole and screw is turned into the insert. \r\rScrew thread inserts are internally threaded plugs or wire coils made to be inserted into an unthreaded hole and to accept an externally threaded fastener. They are assembled into weaker materials (e.g., plastic, wood, and light-weight metals such as magnesium) to provide strong threads. There are many designs of screw thread inserts, one example of which is illustrated in Figure 32.6.

Two types of captive threaded fasteners are illustrated in Figure 32.7. \rA washer is a hardware component often used with threaded fasteners to ensure tightness of the mechanical joint; in its simplest form, it is a flat thin ring of sheet metal. Washers serve various functions. They (1) distribute stresses that might otherwise be concentrated at the bolt or screw head and nut, (2) provide support for large clearance \r\rFIGURE 32.8 Types of washers: (a) plain (\ufb02at) washers; (b) spring washers, used to dampen vibration or compensate for wear; and (c) lockwasher designed to resist loosening of the bolt or screw. \r\rholes in the assembled parts, (3) increase spring tension, (4) protect part surfaces, (5) seal the joint, and (6) resist inadvertent unfastening [13]. Three washer types are illustrated in Figure 32.8. \r\r\r32.1.3 STRESSES AND STRENGTHS IN BOLTED JOINTS \rTypical stresses acting on a bolted or screwed joint include both tensile and shear, as depicted in Figure 32.9. Shown in the figure is a bolt-and-nut assembly. Once tightened, the bolt is loaded in tension, and the parts are loaded in compression. In addition, forces may be acting in opposite directions on the parts, which results in a shear stress on the bolt cross section. Finally, there are stresses applied on the threadsthroughout theirengagement length with the nut in a direction parallel to the axis of the bolt. These shear stresses can cause stripping of the threads. (This failure can also occur on the internal threads of the nut.) \rThe strength of a threaded fastener is generally specified by two measures: \r(1) tensile strength, which has the traditional definition (Section 3.1.1), and (2) proof strength. Proof strength is roughly equivalent to yield strength; specifically, it is the maximum tensile stress to which an externally threaded fastener can be subjected without permanent deformation. Typical values of tensile and proof strength for steel bolts are given in Table 32.2. \rThe problem that can arise during assembly is that the threaded fasteners are overtightened, causing stresses that exceed the strength of the fastener material. Assuming a bolt-and-nut assembly as shown in Figure 32.9, failure can occur in one of the following ways: (1) external threads (e.g., bolt or screw) can strip, (2) internal threads (e.g., nut) can strip, or (3) the bolt can break because of excessive tensile stresses on its cross-sectional \r\r\rTABLE 32.2 Typical values of tensile and proof strengths for steel bolts and screws, diameters range from 6.4 mm (0.25 in) to 38 mm (1.50 in). \rProof Stress \r\rTensile Stress Material MPa lb/in2 MPa lb/in2 \r\rLow/medium C steel 228 33,000 414 60,000 Alloy steel 830 120,000 1030 150,000 \rSource: [13]. \rarea.

This can be avoided by providing adequate thread engagement in the fastener design. Tensile failure \r(3) is the most common problem. The bolt breaks at about 85% of its rated tensile strength because of combined tensile and torsion stresses during tightening [2]. \rThe tensile stress to which a bolt is subjected can be calculated as the tensile load applied to the joint divided by the applicable area: \rF \rs \u00bc\u00f032:1\u00de \rAs \r\rwhere s \u00bc stress, MPa (lb/in2); F \u00bc load, N (lb); and As \u00bc tensile stress area, mm2 (in2). \rThis stress is compared to the bolt strength values listed in Table 32.2. The tensile stress area for a threaded fastener is the cross-sectional area of the minor diameter. This area can be calculated directly from one of the following equations [2], depending on whether the bolt is metric standard or American standard. For the metric standard (ISO), the formula is \rp\rAs \u00bc\u00f0D 0:9382 p\u00de2 \u00f032:2\u00de \r4 \r\rwhere D \u00bc nominal size (basic major diameter) of the bolt or screw, mm; and p \u00bc thread pitch, mm. \rFor the American standard (ANSI), the formula is \rp 0:9743 2 \rAs \u00bc D \u00f032:3\u00de \r4 n \r\rwhere D \u00bc nominal size (basic major diameter) of the bolt or screw, in; and n \u00bc the number of threads per inch. \r\r32.1.4 TOOLS AND METHODS FOR THREADED FASTENERS \rThe basic function of the tools and methods for assembling threaded fasteners is to provide relative rotation between the external and internal threads, and to apply sufficient torque to secure the assembly. Available tools range from simple hand-held screwdrivers or wrenches to powered tools with sophisticated electronic sensors to ensure proper tightening. It is important that the tool match the screw or bolt and/or the nut in style and size, since there are so many heads available. Hand tools are usually made with a single point or blade, but powered tools are generally designed to use interchangeable bits. The powered tools operate by pneumatic, hydraulic, or electric power. \rWhether a threaded fastener serves its intended purpose depends to a large degree on the amount of torque applied to tighten it. Once the bolt or screw (or nut) has been rotated until it is seated against the part surface, additional tightening will increase the tension in the fastener (and simultaneously the compression in the parts being held together); and the tightening will be resisted by an increasing torque. Thus, there is a correlation between the torque required to tighten the fastener and the tensile stress experienced by it. To achieve the desired function in the assembled joint (e.g., to improve fatigue resistance) and to lock the threaded fasteners, the product designer will often specify the tension force that should be applied. This force is called the preload. The following relationship can be used to determine the required torque to obtain a specified preload [13]: \rT \u00bc CtDF \u00f032:4\u00de \rwhere T \u00bc torque, N-mm (lb-in); Ct \u00bc the torque coefficient whose value typically ranges between 0.15 and 0.25, depending on the thread surface conditions; D \u00bc nominal bolt or screw diameter, mm (in); and F \u00bc specified preload tension force, N (lb). \rVarious methods are employed to apply the required torque, including (1) operator feel\u2014not very accurate, but adequate for most assemblies; (2) torque wrenches, which measure the torque as the fastener is being turned; (3) stall-motors, which are motorized wrenches designed to stall when the required torque is reached, and (4) torque-turn tightening, in which the fastener is initially tightened to a low torque level and then rotated a specified additional amount (e.g., a quarter turn). \r\r\rRivets are widely used for achieving a permanent mechanically fastened joint.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 12320, "end_char_idx": 16334, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25c8575b-b88a-48de-bab9-cdd3c49c0072": {"__data__": {"id_": "25c8575b-b88a-48de-bab9-cdd3c49c0072", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/32.txt", "file_name": "32.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40220, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5d537470-5410-48c2-a6c0-21ea6f68123a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/32.txt", "file_name": "32.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40220, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "hash": "b8c859106b6b32b291bd83d997297cfa06e197bdece01820bc09a049447b7f16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fec1fcc0-6d1b-4318-80db-b65a759595c3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/32.txt", "file_name": "32.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40220, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "hash": "7843776f18a63e0521012df8eda109594bb1a95c6ec3c81626e1d7d2f3138150", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "978a6eb3-c59d-46e0-8747-1e2fc14aa0df", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "edc8e8b5971aa156982981da76f2c45d23113524c8bc872ad5c4f06bcb9b2205", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Various methods are employed to apply the required torque, including (1) operator feel\u2014not very accurate, but adequate for most assemblies; (2) torque wrenches, which measure the torque as the fastener is being turned; (3) stall-motors, which are motorized wrenches designed to stall when the required torque is reached, and (4) torque-turn tightening, in which the fastener is initially tightened to a low torque level and then rotated a specified additional amount (e.g., a quarter turn). \r\r\rRivets are widely used for achieving a permanent mechanically fastened joint. Riveting is a fastening method that offers high production rates, simplicity, dependability, and low cost. Despite these apparent advantages, its applications have declined in recent decades in favor of threaded fasteners, welding, and adhesive bonding. Riveting is one of the primary fastening processes in the aircraft and aerospace industries for joining skins to channels and other structural members. \rA rivet is an unthreaded, headed pin used to join two (or more) parts by passing the pin through holes in the parts and then forming (upsetting) a second head in the pin on the opposite side. The deforming operation can be performed hot or cold (hot working or cold working), and by hammering or steady pressing. Once the rivet has been deformed, it cannot be removed except by breaking one of the heads. Rivets are specified by their length, diameter, head, and type. Rivet type refers to five basic geometries that affect how the rivet will be upset to form the second head. The five types are defined in Figure 32.10. In addition, there are special rivets for special applications. \r(b) \rtubular, (c) semi-tubular,(d)bifurcated,and \r\r(e) \rcompression. \r\r\r\r\rFIGURE 32.11 \rFastening with an eyelet: \r(a) \rthe eyelet, and \r\r(b) \rassembly sequence: \r\r(1) \rinserting the eyelet through the hole and \r\r(2) \rsetting operation. \r\r\r\rRivets are used primarily for lap joints. The clearance hole into which the rivet is inserted must be close to the diameter of the rivet. If the hole is too small, rivet insertion will be difficult, thus reducing production rate. If the hole is too large, the rivet will not fill the hole and may bend or compress during formation of the opposite head. Rivet design tables are available to specify the optimum hole sizes. \rThe tooling and methods used in riveting can be divided into the following categories: \r(1) \rimpact, in which a pneumatic hammer delivers a succession of blows to upset the rivet; \r\r(2) \rsteady compression, in which the riveting tool applies a continuous squeezing pressure to upset the rivet; and (3) a combination of impact and compression. Much of the equipment used in riveting is portable and manually operated. Automatic drilling-and-riveting machines are available for drilling the holes and then inserting and upsetting the rivets. \r\r\rEyelets are thin-walled tubular fasteners with a flange on one end, usually made from sheet metal, as in Figure 32.11(a). They are used to produce a permanent lap joint between two (or more) flat parts. Eyelets are substituted for rivets in low-stress applications to save material, weight, and cost. During fastening, the eyelet is inserted through the part holes, and the straight end is formed over to secure the assembly. The forming operation is called setting and is performed by opposing tools that hold the eyelet in position and curl the extended portion of its barrel. Figure 32.11(b) illustrates the sequence for a typical eyelet design. Applications of this fastening method include automotive subassemblies, electrical components, toys, and apparel. \r\rSeveral assembly methods are based on mechanical interference between the two mating parts being joined. This interference, which occurs either during assembly or after the parts are joined, holds the parts together. The methods include press fitting, shrink and expansion fits, snap fits, and retaining rings. \rPress Fitting A press fit assembly is one in which the two components have an interference fit between them.

This interference, which occurs either during assembly or after the parts are joined, holds the parts together. The methods include press fitting, shrink and expansion fits, snap fits, and retaining rings. \rPress Fitting A press fit assembly is one in which the two components have an interference fit between them. The typical case is where a pin (e.g., a straight cylindrical pin) of a certain diameter is pressed into a hole of a slightly smaller diameter. Standard pin sizes are commercially available to accomplish a variety of functions, such as (1) locating and locking the components\u2014used to augment threaded fasteners by holding two (or more) parts in fixed alignment with each other; (2) pivot points, to permit rotation of one component about the other; and (3) shear pins. Except for (3), the pins are normally hardened. Shear pins are made of softer metals so as to break under a sudden or severe shearing load to save the rest of the assembly. Other applications of press fitting include assembly of collars, gears, pulleys, and similar components onto shafts. \r\rThe pressures and stresses in an interference fit can be estimated using several applicable formulas. If the fit consists of a round solid pin or shaft inside a collar (or similar component), as depicted in Figure 32.12, and the components are made of the same material, the radial pressure between the pin and the collar can be determined by [13]: \rEi D2 cD2 p pf \u00bc\u00f032:5\u00de \rD2\rDp \rc \rwhere pf \u00bc radial or interference fit pressure, MPa (lb/in2); E \u00bc modulus of elasticity for the material; i \u00bc interference between the pin (or shaft) and the collar; that is, the starting difference between the inside diameter of the collar hole and the outside diameter of the pin, mm (in); Dc \u00bc outside diameter of the collar, mm (in); and Dp \u00bc pin or shaft diameter, mm (in). \rThe maximum effective stress occurs in the collar at its inside diameter and can be calculated as \r2pf D2 \rc\rMax se \u00bc\u00f032:6\u00de \rD2 D2 \rcp \rwhere Max se \u00bc the maximum effective stress, MPa (lb/in2), and pf is the interference fit pressure computed from Eq. (32.5). \rIn situations in which a straight pin or shaft is pressed into the hole of a large part with geometry other than that of a collar, we can alter the previous equations by taking the outside diameter Dc to be infinite, thus reducing the equation for interference pressure to \rEi \rpf \u00bc\u00f032:7\u00de Dp \rand the corresponding maximum effective stress becomes Max se \u00bc 2pf \u00f032:8\u00de \r\rIn most cases, particularly for ductile metals, the maximum effective stress should be compared with the yield strength of the material, applying an appropriate safety factor, as in the following: \rY \rMax se \u00f032:9\u00de \rSF \r\rwhere Y \u00bc yield strength of the material, and SF is the applicable safety factor. \rVarious pin geometries are available for interference fits. The basic type is a straight pin, usually made from cold-drawn carbon steel wire or bar stock, ranging in diameter from \r1.6 to 25 mm (1/16 to 1.0 in).

Their advantage is that they can readily be driven back out of the hole. \rAdditional pin geometries are commercially available, including grooved pins\u2014 solid straight pins with three longitudinal grooves in which the metal is raised on either side of each groove to cause interference when the pin is pressed into a hole; knurled pins, pins with a knurled pattern that causes interference in the mating hole; and coiled pins, also called spiral pins, which are made by rolling strip stock into a coiled spring. \rShrink and Expansion Fits These terms refer to the assembly of two parts that have an interference fit at room temperature. The typical case is a cylindrical pin or shaft assembled into a collar. To assemble by shrink fitting, the external part is heated to enlarge it by thermal expansion, and the internal part either remains at room temperature or is cooled to contract its size. The parts are then assembled and brought back to room temperature, so that the external part shrinks, and if previously cooled the internal part expands, to form a strong interference fit. An expansion fit is when only the internal part is cooled to contract it for assembly; once inserted into the mating component, it warms to room temperature, expanding to create the interference assembly. These assembly methods are used to fit gears, pulleys, sleeves, and other components onto solid and hollow shafts. \rVarious methods are used to heat and/or cool the workparts. Heating equipment includes torches, furnaces, electric resistance heaters, and electric induction heaters. Cooling methods include conventional refrigeration, packing in dry ice, and immersion in cold liquids, including liquid nitrogen. The resulting change in diameter depends on the coefficient of thermal expansion and the temperature difference that is applied to the part. If we assume that the heating or cooling has produced a uniform temperature throughout the work, then the change in diameter is given by \rD2 D1 \u00bc a D1\u00f0T2 T1\u00de\u00f032:10\u00de \r\rwhere a \u00bc the coefficient of linear thermal expansion, mm/mm-C(in/in-F) for the material (see Table 4.1); T2 \u00bc the temperature to which the parts have been heated or cooled, C( F); T1 \u00bc starting ambient temperature; D2 \u00bc diameter of the part at T2,mm(in); and D1 \u00bc diameter of the part at T1. \rEquations (32.5) through (32.9) for computing interference pressures and effective stresses can be used to determine the corresponding values for shrink and expansion fits. \rSnap Fits and Retaining Rings Snap fits are a variation of interference fits. A snap fit involves joining two parts in which the mating elements possess a temporary interference while being pressed together, but once assembled they interlock to maintain the assembly. A typical example is shown in Figure 32.13: as the parts are pressed together, the mating elements elastically deform to accommodate the interference, subsequently allowing the \r\rFIGURE 32.13 Snap \ufb01t assembly, showing cross sections of two mating parts: (1) before assembly and (2) parts snapped together. \r\rparts to snap together; once in position, the elements become connected mechanically so that they cannot easily be disassembled.

The assembly can be used to locate or restrict the movement of parts mounted on the shaft. Retaining rings are available for both external (shaft) and internal (bore) applications. They are made from either sheet metal or wire stock, heat treated for hardness and stiffness. To assemble a retaining ring, a special pliers tool is used to elastically deform the ring so that it fits over the shaft (or into the bore) and then is released into the groove. \r\r\rIn addition to the mechanical assembly techniques discussed in the preceding, there are several additional methods that involve the use of fasteners. These include stitching, stapling, sewing, and cotter pins. \rStitching, Stapling, and Sewing Industrial stitching and stapling are similar operations involving the use of U-shaped metal fasteners. Stitching is a fastening operation in which a stitching machine is used to form the U-shaped stitches one at a time from steel wire and immediately drive them through the two parts to be joined. Figure 32.15 illustrates several \r\rFIGURE 32.15 \rCommon types of wire stitches: (a) unclinched, \r(b) \rstandard loop, \r\r(c) \rbypass loop, and \r\r(d) \r\ufb02at clinch. \r\r(b) \rsymmetric head, hammerlock point; \r\r(c) \rsquare point; \r\r(d) \rmitered point; and \r\r(e) \rchisel point. \r\r\r\rtypes of wire stitches. The parts to be joined must be relatively thin, consistent with the stitch size, and the assembly can involve various combinations of metal and nonmetal materials. Applications of industrial stitching include light sheetmetal assembly, metal hinges, electrical connections, magazine binding, corrugated boxes, and final product packaging. Conditions that favor stitching in these applications are (1) high-speed operation, (2) elimination of the need for prefabricated holes in the parts, and (3) desirability of using fasteners that encircle the parts. \rIn stapling, preformed U-shaped staples are punched through the two parts to be attached. The staples are supplied in convenient strips. The individual staples are lightly stuck together to form the strip, but they can be separated by the stapling tool for driving. The staples come withvarious point stylestofacilitatetheir entry into the work.Staples areusually applied by means of portable pneumatic guns, into which strips containing several hundred staples can be loaded. Applications of industrial stapling include: furniture and upholstery, assembly of car seats, and various light-gage sheetmetal and plastic assembly jobs. \rSewing is a common joining method for soft, flexible parts such as cloth and leather. The method involves the use of a long thread or cord interwoven with the parts so as to produce a continuous seam between them. The process is widely used in the needle trades industry for assembling garments. \rCotter Pins Cotter pins are fasteners formed from half-round wire into a single two-stem pin, as in Figure 32.16. They vary in diameter, ranging between 0.8 mm (0.031 in) and 19 mm (3/4 in), and in point style, several of which are shown in the figure. Cotter pins are inserted into holes in the mating parts and their legs are split to lock the assembly. They are used to secure parts onto shafts and similar applications. \r\rThese assembly methods form a permanent joint between parts by shaping or reshaping one of the components through a manufacturing process such as casting, molding, or sheet-metal forming. \rFIGURE 32.17 \rExamples of molded-in inserts: (a) threaded bushing and (b) threaded stud.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 25988, "end_char_idx": 30271, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf63600a-9746-4604-a0d5-43f24c7f4d4c": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf63600a-9746-4604-a0d5-43f24c7f4d4c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/32.txt", "file_name": "32.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40220, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5d537470-5410-48c2-a6c0-21ea6f68123a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/32.txt", "file_name": "32.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40220, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "hash": "b8c859106b6b32b291bd83d997297cfa06e197bdece01820bc09a049447b7f16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f8f604f-401a-4f89-bd9a-cd1096a6675e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/32.txt", "file_name": "32.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40220, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "hash": "8ae3a32d4546a9084d55caa9a0f70fa1590ae93f54c1e6c88396b1036f35d3ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fd03ac9a-3bde-4f42-a37c-230580fdcfac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c42251a4842a7d07393e77f18c9c690df2870977b0c2e620c877e29cc8bf7172", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The process is widely used in the needle trades industry for assembling garments. \rCotter Pins Cotter pins are fasteners formed from half-round wire into a single two-stem pin, as in Figure 32.16.

Inserting a separate component is preferable to molding or casting its shape if the superior properties (e.g., strength) of the insert material are required, or the geometry achieved through the use of the insert is too complex or intricate to incorporate into the mold. Examples of inserts in molded or cast parts include internally threaded bushings and nuts, externally threaded studs, bearings, and electrical contacts. Some of these are illustrated in Figure 32.17. Internally threaded inserts must be placed into the mold with threaded pins to prevent the molding material from flowing into the threaded hole. \rPlacing inserts into a mold has certain disadvantages in production: (1) design of the mold becomes more complicated; (2) handling and placing the insert into the cavity takes time that reduces production rate; and (3) inserts introduce a foreign material into the casting or molding, and in the event of a defect, the cast metal or plastic cannot be easily reclaimed and recycled. Despite these disadvantages, use of inserts is often the most functional design and least-cost production method. \rIntegral Fasteners Integral fasteners involve deformation of component parts so they interlock and create a mechanically fastened joint. This assembly method is most common for sheetmetal parts. The possibilities, Figure 32.18, include (a) lanced tabs to attach wires or shafts to sheet-metal parts; (b) embossed protrusions, in which bosses are formed in one part and flattened over the mating assembled part; (c) seaming, where the edges of two separate sheet-metal parts or the opposite edges of the same part are bent over to form the fastening seam\u2014the metal must be ductile in order for the bending to be feasible; \r(d) beading, in which a tube-shaped part is attached to a smaller shaft (or other round part) by deforming the outer diameter inward to cause an interference around the entire circumference; and (e) dimpling\u2014forming of simple round indentations in an outer part to retain an inner part. \rCrimping, in which the edges of one part are deformed over a mating component, is another example of integral assembly. A common example involves squeezing the barrel of an electrical terminal onto a wire (Section 35.5.1). \r\r\rDesign for assembly (DFA) has received much attention in recent years because assembly operations constitute a high labor cost for many manufacturing companies. The key to successful design for assembly can be simply stated [3]: (1) design the product with as few parts as possible, and (2) design the remaining parts so they are easy to assemble. The cost of assembly is determined largely during product design, because that is when the number \r\r\r(b) \rembossed protrusions, similar to riveting, (c) single-lock seaming, (d) beading, and \r\r(e) \rdimpling.

Once these decisions have been made, there is little that can be done in manufacturing to influence assembly costs (except, of course, to manage the operations well). \rIn this section we consider some of the principles that can be applied during product design to facilitate assembly. Most of the principles have been developed in the context of mechanical assembly, although some of them apply to the other assembly and joining processes. Much of the research in design for assembly has been motivated by the increasing use of automated assembly systems in industry. Accordingly, our discussion is divided into two sections, the first dealing with general principles of DFA, and the second concerned specifically with design for automated assembly. \rFIGURE 32.19 \rSymmetrical parts are generally easier to insert and assemble: (a) only one rotational orientation possible for insertion; \r(b) two possible orientations; (c) four possible orientations; and (d) in\ufb01nite rotational orientations. \r\r\r32.6.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DFA \rMost of the general principles apply to both manual and automated assembly. Their goal is to achieve the required design function by the simplest and lowest cost means. The following recommendations have been compiled from [1], [3], [4], and [6]: \rUse the fewest number of parts possible to reduce the amount of assembly required. \rThis principle is implemented by combining functions within the same part that might otherwise be accomplished by separate components (e.g., using a plastic molded part instead of an assembly of sheet metal parts). \rReduce the number of threaded fasteners required. Instead of using separate threaded fasteners, design the component to utilize snap fits, retaining rings, integral fasteners, and similar fastening mechanisms that can be accomplished more rapidly. Use threaded fasteners only where justified (e.g., where disassembly or adjustment is required). \rStandardize fasteners. This is intended to reduce the number of sizes and styles of fasteners required in the product. Ordering and inventory problems are reduced, the assembly worker does not have to distinguish between so many separate fasteners, the workstation is simplified, and the variety of separate fastening tools is reduced. \rReduce parts orientation difficulties. Orientation problems are generally reduced by designing a part to be symmetrical and minimizing the number of asymmetric features. This allows easier handling and insertion during assembly. This principle is illustrated in Figure 32.19. \rAvoid parts that tangle. Certain part configurations are more likely to become entangled in parts bins, frustrating assembly workers or jamming automatic feeders. Parts with hooks, holes, slots, and curls exhibit more of this tendency than parts without these features. See Figure 32.20. \r\r\r(b) parts designed to avoid tangling. \r\r\r32.6.2 DESIGN FOR AUTOMATED ASSEMBLY \rMethods suitable for manual assembly are not necessarily the best methods for automated assembly. Some assembly operations readily performed by a human worker are quite difficult to automate (e.g., assembly using bolts and nuts). To automate the assembly process, parts fastening methods must be specified during product design that lend themselves to machine insertion and joining techniques and do not require the senses, dexterity, and intelligence of human assembly workers. Following are some recommendations and principles that can be applied in product design to facilitate automated assembly [6], [10]: \rUse modularity in product design. Increasing the number of separate tasks that are accomplished by an automated assembly system will reduce the reliability of the system. To alleviate the reliability problem, Riley [10] suggests that the design of the product be modular in which each module or subassembly has a maximum of 12 or 13 parts to be produced on a single assembly system. Also, the subassembly should be designed around abasepart to which other components are added. \rReduce the need for multiple components to be handled at once. The preferred practice for automated assembly is to separate the operations at different stations rather than to simultaneously handle and fasten multiple components at the same workstation. \rLimit the required directions of access. This means that the number of directions in which new components are added to the existing subassembly should be minimized. Ideally, all components should be added vertically from above, if possible. \rHigh-quality components. High performance of an automated assembly system requires that consistently good-quality components are added at each workstation. Poor quality components cause jams in feeding and assembly mechanisms that result in downtime. \rUse of snap fit assembly.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 33292, "end_char_idx": 38253, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6652e07-9809-4867-9e4c-80bc4fb6ee82": {"__data__": {"id_": "d6652e07-9809-4867-9e4c-80bc4fb6ee82", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/32.txt", "file_name": "32.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40220, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5d537470-5410-48c2-a6c0-21ea6f68123a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/32.txt", "file_name": "32.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40220, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "hash": "b8c859106b6b32b291bd83d997297cfa06e197bdece01820bc09a049447b7f16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd03ac9a-3bde-4f42-a37c-230580fdcfac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/32.txt", "file_name": "32.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40220, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "hash": "db452bfa6cf21e7cf7d8124717da863f3c890255166f79b049a57ea19478303e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Also, the subassembly should be designed around abasepart to which other components are added. \rReduce the need for multiple components to be handled at once.

QC has often been limited to inspecting the product and its components, and deciding whether the dimensions and other features conformed to design specifications. If they did, the product was shipped. The modern view of quality control encompasses a broader scope of activities, including various quality programs such as statistical process control and Six Sigma as well as modern inspection technologies such as coordinate measuring machines and machine vision. In this chapter, we discuss these and other quality and inspection topics that are relevant today in modern manufacturing operations. Let us begin our coverage by defining product quality. \r\r\r\r42.1 PRODUCT QUALITY \rThe dictionary defines quality as \u2018\u2018the degree of excellence which a thing possesses,\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018the features that make something what it is\u2019\u2019\u2014its characteristic elements and attributes. The American Society for Quality (ASQ) defines quality as \u2018\u2018the totality of features and characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy given needs\u2019\u2019 [2]. \rIn a manufactured product, quality has two aspects [4]: \r(1) product features and (2) freedom from deficiencies. Product features are the characteristics of the product that result from design. They are the functional and aesthetic features of the item intended to appeal to and provide satisfaction tothe customer. In anautomobile, these features includethesizeofthecar,itsstyling,thefinishofthebody,gas mileage, reliability, reputation of the manufacturer, and similar aspects. They also include the available options for the customer to choose. The sum of a product\u2019s features usually defines its grade, which relates to the level in the market at which the product is aimed. Cars (and most other products) come in different grades. Some cars provide basic transportation because that is what some customers want, while others are upscale for consumers willing to spend more to own a \u2018\u2018better product.\u2019\u2019 The features of a product are decided in design, and they generally determine the inherent cost of the product. Superior features and more of them mean higher cost. \rFreedomfromdeficiencies means that the product does what itissupposed to do (within the limitations of its design features), that it is absent of defects and out-of-tolerance conditions, and that no parts are missing. This aspect of quality includes components and subassemblies of the product as well as the product itself. Freedom from deficiencies means conforming to design specifications, which is accomplished in manufacturing. Although the inherent cost to make a product is a function of its design, minimizing the product\u2019s cost to the lowest possible level within the limits set by its design is largely a matter of avoiding defects, tolerance deviations, and other errors during production. Costs of these deficiencies make a long list indeed: scrapped parts, larger lot sizes for scrap allowances, rework, reinspection, sortation, customer complaintsand returns,warrantycosts and customer allowances, lost sales, and lost good will in the marketplace. \rThus, product features are the aspect of quality for which the design department is responsible. Product features determine to a large degree the price that a company can charge for its products. Freedom from deficiencies is the quality aspect for which the manufacturing departments are responsible. The ability to minimize these deficiencies has an important influence on the cost of the product. These generalities oversimplify the way things work, because the responsibility for high quality extends well beyond the design and manufacturing functions in an organization. \r\rIn any manufacturing operation, variability exists in the process output.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4568, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "07268c38-4571-4f47-841c-6f3c6c526a11": {"__data__": {"id_": "07268c38-4571-4f47-841c-6f3c6c526a11", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/42.txt", "file_name": "42.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 65236, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "be9713fd-6d9c-429e-bf4e-6926e92f2158", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/42.txt", "file_name": "42.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 65236, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "hash": "e660c0eb516f9d2cadeca544fd0c9150539ab64563dbc4354eddff2cb917e86e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "349323e9-04dc-41f8-ab33-ff6686b796d7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/42.txt", "file_name": "42.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 65236, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "hash": "6c8b7b5d09cc95831b9cdb7baefc50cecd1bfcdb39d9c40cb4b78f542138e9a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "df111817-bd03-4f23-bb6d-99dc0fa82f6b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "742333bd660ebe43257e0fbd54519efc90a38d8bfa6274fd621510d01e00c23e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Costs of these deficiencies make a long list indeed: scrapped parts, larger lot sizes for scrap allowances, rework, reinspection, sortation, customer complaintsand returns,warrantycosts and customer allowances, lost sales, and lost good will in the marketplace. \rThus, product features are the aspect of quality for which the design department is responsible.

These generalities oversimplify the way things work, because the responsibility for high quality extends well beyond the design and manufacturing functions in an organization. \r\rIn any manufacturing operation, variability exists in the process output. In a machining operation, which is one of the most accurate processes, the machined parts may appear to be identical, but close inspection reveals dimensional differences from one part to the next. Manufacturing variations can be divided into two types: random and assignable. \rRandom variations are caused by many factors: human variability within each operation cycle, variations in raw materials, machine vibration, and so on. Individually, these factors may not amount to much, but collectively the errors can be significant enough to cause trouble unless they are within the tolerances for the part. Random variations typically form a normal statistical distribution. The output of the process tends to cluster about the mean value, in terms of the product\u2019s quality characteristic of interest (e.g., length, diameter). Alarge proportion of the population of parts is centered around the mean, with fewer parts away from the mean. When the only variations in the process are of this type, the process is said to be in statistical control.This kind of variability will continue so long as the process is operating normally. It is when the process deviates from this normal operating condition that variations of the second type appear. \rAssignable variations indicate an exception from normal operating conditions. Something has occurred in the process that is not accounted for by random variations. Reasons for assignable variations include operator mistakes, defective raw materials, tool failures, machine malfunctions, and so on. Assignable variations in manufacturing usually betray themselves by causing the output to deviate from the normal distribution. The process is no longer in statistical control. \rProcess capability relates to the normal variations inherent in the output when the where PC \u00bc process capability; m \u00bc process mean, which is set at the nominal value of the product characteristic when bilateral tolerancing is used (Section 5.1.1); and s \u00bc standard deviation of the process. Assumptions underlying this definition are (1) steady state operation has been achieved and the process is in statistical control, and (2) the output is normally distributed. Under these assumptions, 99.73% of the parts produced will have output values that fall within 3.0s of the mean. \rprocess is in statistical control. By definition, process capability equals  3 standard  \rdeviations about the mean output value (a total of 6 standard deviations),  \rPC \u00bc m  3 s  \u00f042:1\u00de  \r\rThe process capability of a given manufacturing operation is not always known, and experiments must be conducted to assess it. Methods are available to estimate the natural tolerance limits based on a sampling of the process. \rThe issue of tolerances is critical to product quality. Design engineers tend to assign dimensional tolerances to components and assemblies based on their judgment of how size variations will affect function and performance. Conventional wisdom is that closer tolerances beget better performance. Small regard is given to the cost resulting from tolerances that are unduly tight relative to process capability. As tolerance is reduced, the cost of achieving the tolerance tends to increase because additional processing steps may be needed and/or more accurate and expensive production machines may be required. The design engineer should be aware of this relationship. Although primary consideration must be given to function in assigning tolerances, cost is also afactor, and any reliefthat can be given to the manufacturing departments in the form of widertoleranceswithout sacrificing product function is worthwhile. \rDesign tolerances must be compatible with process capability.

The design engineer should be aware of this relationship. Although primary consideration must be given to function in assigning tolerances, cost is also afactor, and any reliefthat can be given to the manufacturing departments in the form of widertoleranceswithout sacrificing product function is worthwhile. \rDesign tolerances must be compatible with process capability. It serves no useful purpose to specify a tolerance of 0.025 mm ( 0.001 in) on a dimension if the process capability is significantly wider than 0.025 mm ( 0.001 in). Either the tolerance should be opened further (if design functionality permits), or a different manufacturing process should be selected. Ideally, the specified tolerance should be greater than the process capability. If function and available processes prevent this, then sorting must be included in the manufacturing sequence to inspect every unit and separate those that meet specification from those that do not. \rDesign tolerances can be specified as being equal to process capability as defined in Eq. (42.1). The upper and lower boundaries of this range are known as the natural tolerance limits. When design tolerances are set equal to the natural tolerance limits, then 99.73% of the parts will be within tolerance and 0.27% will be outside the limits. Any increase in the tolerance range will reduce the percentage of defective parts. \rTolerances are not usually set at their natural limits by product design engineers; tolerances are specified based on the allowable variability that will achieve required function and performance. It is useful to know the ratio of the specified tolerance relative to the process capability. This is indicated by the process capability index \rT \rPCI \u00bc\u00f042:2\u00de \r6s \rwhere PCI \u00bc process capability index; T \u00bc tolerance range\u2014the difference between upper and lower limits of the specified tolerance; and 6s \u00bc natural tolerance limits. The underlying assumption in this definition is that the process mean is set equal to the nominal design specification, so that the numerator and denominator in Eq. (42.2) are centered about the same value. \rTable 42.1 shows the effect of various multiples of standard deviation on defect rate (i.e., proportion of out-of-tolerance parts). The desire to achieve very-low-fraction defect rates has led to the popular notion of \u2018\u2018six sigma\u2019\u2019 limits in quality control. Achieving Six Sigma limits virtually eliminates defects in a manufactured product, assuming the process is maintained within statistical control. As we shall see later in the chapter, Six Sigma quality programs do not quite live up to their names. Before addressing that issue, let us discuss a widely used quality control technique: statistical process control. \rTABLE 42.1 Defect rate when tolerance is de\ufb01ned in terms of number of standard deviations of the process, given that the process is operating in statistical control. \rNo. of Standard Process Capability Defect Defective Parts Deviations Index Rate, % per Million \r1.0 0.333 31.74% 317,400 2.0 0.667 4.56% 45,600 3.0 1.00 0.27% 2,700 4.0 1.333 0.0063% 63 5.0 1.667 0.000057% 0.57 6.0 2.00 0.0000002% 0.002 \r\rStatistical process control (SPC) involves the use of various statistical methods to assess and analyze variations in a process.

It is the objective of a control chart to identify when the process has gone out of statistical control, thus signaling that some corrective action should be taken. \rA control chart is a graphical technique in which statistics computed from measured values of a certain process characteristic are plotted over time to determine if the process remains in statistical control.

It is the objective of a control chart to identify when the process has gone out of statistical control, thus signaling that some corrective action should be taken. \rA control chart is a graphical technique in which statistics computed from measured values of a certain process characteristic are plotted over time to determine if the process remains in statistical control. The general form of the control chart is illustrated in Figure 42.1. The chart consists of three horizontal lines that remain constant over time: a center, a lower control limit (LCL), and an upper control limit (UCL). The center is usually set at the nominal design value. The upper and lower control limits are generally set at 3standard deviations of the sample means. \rIt is highly unlikely that a random sample drawn from the process will lie outside the upper or lower control limits while the process is in statistical control. Thus, if it happens that a sample value does fall outside these limits, it is interpreted to mean that the process is out of control. Therefore, an investigation is undertaken to determine the reason for the out-of-control condition, with appropriate corrective action to eliminate the condition. By similar reasoning, if the process is found to be in statistical control, and there is no evidence of undesirable trends in the data, then no adjustments should be made since they would introduce an assignable variation to the process. The philosophy, \u2018\u2018If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u2019\u2019 is applicable to control charts. \r\rThere are two basic types of control charts: (1) control charts for variables and \r(2) control charts for attributes. Control charts for variables require a measurement of the quality characteristic of interest. Control charts for attributes simply require a determination of whether a part is defective or how many defects there are in the sample. \r42.3.1 CONTROL CHARTS FOR VARIABLES \rA process that is out of statistical control manifests this condition in the form of significant changes in process mean and/or process variability. Corresponding to these possibilities, there are two principal types of control charts for variables: x chart and R chart. The x chart (call it \u2018\u2018x bar chart\u2019\u2019) is used to plot the average measured value of a certain quality characteristic for each of a series of samples taken from the production process. It indicates how the process mean changes over time. The R chart plots the range of each sample, thus monitoring the variability of the process and indicating whether it changes over time. \rA suitable quality characteristic of the process must be selected as the variable to be monitored on the x and R charts. In a mechanical process, this might be a shaft diameter or other critical dimension. Measurements of the process itself must be used to construct the two control charts. \rWith the process operating smoothly and absent of assignable variations, a series of samples (e.g., m \u00bc 20 or more is generally recommended) of small size (e.g., n \u00bc 4, 5, or 6 parts per sample) are collected and the characteristic of interest is measured for each part. The following procedure is used to construct the center, LCL, and UCL for each chart: \r1. \rCompute the mean x and range R for each of the m samples. \r\r2. \rCompute the grand mean x, which is the mean of the x values for the m samples; this will be the center for the x chart. \r\r3. \rCompute R, which is the mean of the R values for the m samples; this will be the center for the R chart. \r\r4. \rDetermine the upper and lower control limits, UCL and LCL, for the x and R charts.

Examples of these kinds of attributes include number of defects per automobile, fraction of bad parts in a sample, existence or absence of flash in plastic moldings, and number of flaws in a roll of sheet steel. The two principal types of control charts for attributes are the p chart, which plots the fraction defect rate in successive samples; and the c chart, which plots the number of defects, flaws, or other nonconformities per sample. \rp Chart In the p chart, the quality characteristic of interest is the proportion (p for proportion) of nonconforming or defective units. For each sample, this proportion pi is the ratio of the number of nonconforming or defective items di over the number of units in the sample n (we assume samples of equal size in constructing and using the control chart) \r\rdi \rpi \u00bc\u00f042:5\u00de \rn where i is used to identify the sample. If the pi values for a sufficient number of samples are averaged, the mean value p is a reasonable estimate of the true value of p for the process.

For x and R charts, the x and R values of the measured characteristic are plotted on the control chart. By convention, the points are usually connected, as in our figures. To interpret the data, one looks for signs that indicate the process is not in statistical control. The most obvious sign is when x or R (or both) lie outside the LCL or UCL limits. This indicatesan assignable cause such asbad starting materials, new operator, broken tooling, or similar factors. An out-of-limit x indicates a shift in the process mean. An out-of-limit R shows that the variability of the process has changed. The usual effect is that R increases, indicating variabilityhas risen. Less obvious conditions may reveal process problems, even though the sample points lie within the 3s limits. These conditions include (1) trends or cyclical patterns in the data, which may mean wear or other factors that occur as a function of time; (2) sudden changes in average level of the data; and \r(3) points consistently near the upper or lower limits. \rThe same kinds of interpretations that apply to the x chart and R chart are also applicable to the p chart and c chart. \r\rStatistical process control is widely used for monitoring the quality of manufactured parts and products. Several additional quality programs are also used in industry, and in this section we briefly describe four of them: (1) total quality management, (2) Six Sigma, \r(3) Taguchi methods, and (4) ISO 9000. These programs are not alternatives to statistical process control; in fact, the tools used in SPC are included within the methodologies of total quality management and Six Sigma. \r\r42.4.1 TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT \rTotal quality management (TQM) is a management approach to quality that pursues three main goals: (1) achieving customer satisfaction, (2) encouraging the involvement of the entire workforce, and (3) continuous improvement. \rThe customer and customer satisfaction are a central focus of TQM, and products are designed and manufactured with this focus in mind. The product must be designed with the features that customers want, and it must be manufactured free of deficiencies. Within the scope of customer satisfaction is the recognition that there are two categories of customers: \r(1) external customers and (2) internal customers. External customers are those who purchase the company\u2019s products and services. Internal customers are inside the company, such as the company\u2019s final assembly department which is the customer of the parts production departments. For the total organization to be effective and efficient, satisfaction must be achieved in both categories of customers. \rIn TQM, worker involvement in the quality efforts of the organization extends from the top executives through all levels beneath. There isrecognition of the important influence that product design has on product quality and how decisions made during design affect the quality that can be achieved in manufacturing.

There isrecognition of the important influence that product design has on product quality and how decisions made during design affect the quality that can be achieved in manufacturing. In addition, production workers are made responsible for the quality of their own output, rather than rely on inspectors to uncover defects after the parts are already produced. TQM training, including use of the tools of statistical process control, is provided to all workers. The pursuit of high quality is embraced by every member of the organization. \rThe third goal of TQM is continuous improvement; that is, adopting the attitude that it is always possible to make something better, whether it is a product or a process. Continuous improvement in an organization is generally implemented using worker teams that have been organized to solve specific problems that are identified in production. The problems are not limited to quality issues. They may include productivity, cost, safety, or any other area of interest to the organization. Team members are selected on the basis of their knowledge and expertise in the problem area. They are drawn from various departments and serve part-time on the team, meeting several times per month until they are able to make recommendations and/or solve the problem. Then the team is disbanded. \r\r42.4.2 SIX SIGMA \rThe Six Sigma quality program originated and was first used at Motorola Corporation in the 1980s. It has been adopted by many other companies in the United States and was briefly discussed in Section 1.5 as one of the trends in manufacturing. Six Sigma is quite similar to total quality management in its emphasis on management involvement, worker teams to solve specific problems, and the use of SPC tools such as control charts. The major difference between Six Sigma and TQM is that Six Sigma establishes measurable targets for quality based on the number of standard deviations (sigma s)awayfromthe mean in theNormal distribution. Six sigma implies near perfectionin the process in the normal distribution. A process operating at the 6s level in a Six Sigma program produces no more than 3.4 defects per million, where a defect is anything that might result in lack of customer satisfaction. \rAs in TQM, worker teams participate in problem-solving projects. A project requires the Six Sigma team to (1) define the problem, (2) measure the process and assess current performance, (3) analyze the process, (4) recommend improvements, and (5) develop a control plan to implement and sustain the improvements. The responsibility of management in Six Sigma is to identify important problemsintheiroperationsand sponsorthe teamsto address those problems. \rStatistical Basis of Six Sigma An underlying assumption in Six Sigma is that the defects in any process can be measured and quantified. Once quantified, the causes of the defects can be identified, and improvements can be made to eliminate or reduce the defects. The effects of any improvements can be assessed using the same measurements in a before-andafter comparison. The comparison is often summarized as a sigma level; for example, the process is now operating at the 4.8-sigma level whereas before it was only operating at the 2.6-sigma level. The relationship between sigma level and defects per million (DPM) is listed in Table 42.3 for a Six Sigma program. We see that the DPM was previously at 135,666 defects per 1,000,000 in our example, whereas it has now been reduced to 108 DPM. \r986 Chapter 42/Quality Control and Inspection  \rTABLE 42.3 Sigma Levels and Corresponding Defects Per Million in a Six Sigma Program.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 22459, "end_char_idx": 26726, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9cddcdbe-2498-4f27-8f14-43136cbca830": {"__data__": {"id_": "9cddcdbe-2498-4f27-8f14-43136cbca830", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/42.txt", "file_name": "42.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 65236, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "be9713fd-6d9c-429e-bf4e-6926e92f2158", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/42.txt", "file_name": "42.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 65236, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "hash": "e660c0eb516f9d2cadeca544fd0c9150539ab64563dbc4354eddff2cb917e86e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c6980710-17db-428e-9c18-659d2e21171f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/42.txt", "file_name": "42.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 65236, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "hash": "8d3f94735f160ede89eadbaf9c1d22e26b6bd4e0f57908a22717cc1696e0d23e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "317986fe-0e38-4916-a177-9914c4110b64", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "55a38b0c6cfd44fbafe241bb793c1e9e69894014e1274e918664f83be13fdea7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Once quantified, the causes of the defects can be identified, and improvements can be made to eliminate or reduce the defects.

It implies that the process is stable and in statistical control, and the variable representing the output of the process is normally distributed. Under these conditions, 99.73% of the output will be within the 3s range, and 0.27% or 2700 parts per million will lie outside these limits (0.135% or 1350 parts per million beyond the upper limit and the same number beyond the lower limit). But wait a minute, if we look up 3.0 sigma in Table 42.3, we find that there are 66,807 defects per million. Why is there a difference between the standard normal distribution value (2700 DPM and the value given in Table 42.3 (66,807 DPM)? There are two reasons for this discrepancy. First, the values in Table 42.3 refer to only one tail of the distribution, so that an appropriate comparison with the standard normal tables would only use one tail of the distribution (1350 DPM). Second, and much more significant, is that when Motorola devised the Six Sigma program, they considered the operation of processes over long periods of time, and processes over long periods tend to experience shifts from their original process means. To compensate for these shifts, Motorola decided to adjust the standard normal values by 1.5s.To summarize, Table 42.3 includes only one tail of the normal distribution, and it shifts the distribution by 1.5 sigma relative to the standard normal distribution. These effects can be seen in Figure 42.3. \rMeasuring the Sigma Level In a Six Sigma project, the performance level of the process of interest is reduced to a sigma level. This is done at two points during the project: (1) after measurements have been taken of the process as it is currently operating and (2) after process improvements have been made to assess the effect of the improvements. This provides a before-and-after comparison. High sigma values represent good performance; low sigma values mean poor performance. \rTo find the sigma level, the number of defects per million must first be determined. There are three measures of defects per million used in Six Sigma. The first and most important is the defects per million opportunities (DPMO), which considers that there may be more than one type of defect that can occur in each unit (product or service).

In this section we review two of the Taguchi methods: (1) the loss function and (2) robust design. More complete coverage can be found among our references [5], [10]. \rThe Loss Function Taguchi defines quality as \u2018\u2018the loss a product costs society from the time the product is released for shipment\u2019\u2019 [10]. Loss includes costs to operate, failure to function, maintenance and repair costs, customer dissatisfaction, injuries caused by poor design, and similar costs. Some of these losses are difficult to quantify in monetary terms, but they are nevertheless real. Defective products (or their components) that are exposed before shipment are not considered part of this loss. Instead, any expense to the company resulting from scrap or rework of defective product is a manufacturing cost rather than a quality loss. \rLoss occurs when a product\u2019s functional characteristic differs from its nominal or target value. Although functional characteristics do not translate directly into dimensional features, the loss relationship is most readily understood in terms of dimensions. When the dimension of a component deviates from its nominal value, the component\u2019s function is adversely affected. No matter how small the deviation, there is some loss in function. The loss increases at an accelerating rate as the deviation grows, according to Taguchi. If we let x \u00bcthe quality characteristic of interest and N \u00bcits nominal value, then the lossfunction will be a U-shaped curve as in Figure 42.4(a). A quadratic equation can be used to describe this curve: \r2\rLx\u00f0\u00de\u00bckx\u00f0 N\u00de\u00f042:13\u00de \rwhere L(x) \u00bcloss function; k \u00bcconstant of proportionality; and x and N are defined above. At some level of deviation (x2 N) \u00bc (x1 N), the loss will be prohibitive, and it is necessary to scrap or rework the product. This level identifies one possible way of specifying the tolerance limit for the dimension. \rIn the traditional approach to quality control, tolerance limits are defined and any product within those limits is acceptable. Whether the quality characteristic (e.g., the dimension) is close to the nominal value or close to one of the tolerance limits, it is acceptable. Trying to visualize this approach in terms analogous to the preceding relation, we obtain the discontinuous loss function in Figure 42.4(b). The reality is that products closer to the nominal \r\rx1 N x2 x N\rquadratic quality loss \rTolerance \rTolerance \rfunction.

In order to improve quality and customer satisfaction, one must attempt to reduce the loss by designing the product and process to be as close as possible to the target value. \rA certain product has a critical dimension that is specified as 20.00 0.04 cm. Repair records indicate that if the tolerance is exceeded, there is a 75% probability that the product will be returned to the manufacturer at a cost of $80 for replacement and shipping. (a) Estimate the constant kin the Taguchi loss function, Eq. (42.13). (b) Using the loss function constant determined in (a), what would be the value of the loss function if the company could maintain a tolerance of 0.01 cm instead of 0.04 cm? \rSolution: In Eq.

Taguchi calls the variations noise factors. A noise factor is a source of variation that is impossible or difficult to control and that affects the functional characteristics of the product. Three types of noise factors can be distinguished: (1) unit-to-unit, (2) internal, and (3) external. \rUnit-to-unit noise factors consist of inherent random variations in the process or product caused by variability in raw materials, machinery, and human participation. These are noise factors we have previously called random variations in the process. They are associated with a production process that is in statistical control. \rInternal noise factors are sources of variation that are internal to the product or process. They include time-dependent factors such as wear of mechanical components, spoilage of raw materials, and fatigue of metal parts; and operational errors, such as improper settings on the product or machine tool. An external noise factor is a source of variation that is external to the product or process, such as outside temperature, humidity, raw material supply, and input voltage. Internal and external noise factors constitute what we have previously called assignable variations. \rA robust design is one in which the product\u2019s function and performance are relatively insensitive to variations in design and manufacturing parameters. It involves the design of both the product and process so that the manufactured product will be relatively unaffected by all noise factors. An example of a robust product design is an automobile whose ignition starter works as well in Minneapolis, Minnesota in winter as in Meridian, Mississippi in summer. An example of robust process design is a metal extrusion operation that produces good product despite temperature variations in the starting billet. \r\r42.4.4 ISO 9000 \rISO 9000 is a set of international standards that relate to the quality of the products (and services, if applicable) delivered by a given facility. The standards were developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which is based in Geneva, Switzerland. ISO 9000 establishes standards for the systems and procedures usedby the facility that determine the quality of its products. ISO 9000 is not a standard for the products themselves. Its focus is on systems and procedures, which include the facility\u2019s organizational structure, responsibilities, methods, and resources needed to manage quality. ISO 9000 is concerned with the activities used by the facility to ensure that its products achieve customer satisfaction. \rISO 9000 can be implemented in two ways, formally and informally. Formal implementation means that the facilitybecomes registered, which certifies that the facility meets the requirements of the standard. Registration is obtained through a third-party agency that conducts on-site inspections and reviews the facility\u2019s quality systems and procedures. A benefit of registration is that it qualifies the facility to do business with companies that require ISO 9000 registration, which is common in the European Economic Community where certain products are regulated and ISO 9000 registration is required for companies making these products. \rInformal implementation of ISO 9000 means that the facility practices the standards or portions thereof simply to improve its quality systems. Such improvements are worthwhile, even without formal certification, for companies desiring to deliver high quality products. \r\rInspection involves the use of measurement and gaging techniques to determine whether a product, its components, subassemblies, or starting materials conform to design specifications.

Such improvements are worthwhile, even without formal certification, for companies desiring to deliver high quality products. \r\rInspection involves the use of measurement and gaging techniques to determine whether a product, its components, subassemblies, or starting materials conform to design specifications. The design specifications are established by the product designer, and for mechanical products they refer to dimensions, tolerances, surface finish, and similar features. Dimensions, tolerances, and surface finish were defined in Chapter 5, and many of the measuring instruments and gages for assessing these specifications were described in that chapter. \rInspection is performed before, during, and after manufacturing. The incoming materials and starting parts are inspected upon receipt from suppliers; work units are inspected at various stages during their production; and the final product should be inspected prior to shipment to the customer. \rWe should clarify the distinction between inspection and testing, which is a closely related topic. Whereas inspection determines the quality of the product relative to design specifications, testing generally refers to thefunctional aspects of the product. Does the product operate the way it is supposed to operate? Will it continue to operate for a reasonable period of time? Will it operate in environments of extreme temperature and humidity? In quality control, testing is a procedure in which the product, subassembly, part, or material is observed under conditions that might be encountered during service. For example, a product might be tested by operating it for a certain period of time to determine whether it functions properly. If it passes the test, it is approved for shipment to the customer. \rTesting of a component or material is sometimes damaging or destructive. In these cases, the items must be tested on a sampling basis. The expense of destructive testing is significant, and great efforts are made to develop methods that do not destroy the item. These methods are referred to as nondestructive testing or nondestructive evaluation. \rInspections divide into two types: (1) inspection by variables, in which the product or part dimensions of interest are measured by the appropriate measuring instruments; and (2) inspection by attributes, in which the parts are gauged to determine whether they are within tolerance limits. The advantage of measuring a part dimension is that data are obtained about its actual value. The data might be recorded over time and used to analyze trends in the manufacturing process. Adjustments in the process can be made based on the data so that future parts are produced closer to the nominal design value. \rWhen a part dimension is simply gaged, all that is known is whether it is within tolerance or too big or too small. On the positive side, gaging can be done quickly and at low cost. \r\r42.5.1 MANUAL AND AUTOMATED INSPECTION \rInspection procedures are often performed manually. The work is usually boring and monotonous, yet the need for precision and accuracy is high. Hours are sometimes required to measure the important dimensions of only one part. Because of the time and cost of manual inspection, statistical sampling procedures are generally used to reduce the need to inspect every part. \rSampling versus 100% Inspection When sampling inspection is used, the number of parts in the sample is generally small comparedtothe quantity of parts produced. The sample size may be only 1% of the production run. Because not all of the items in the population are measured, there is a risk in any sampling procedure that defective parts will slip through. One of the goals in statistical sampling is to define the expected risk; that is, to determine the average defect rate that will pass through the sampling procedure. The risk can be reduced by increasing the sample size and the frequency with which samples are collected. But the fact remains that 100% good quality cannot be guaranteed in a sampling inspection procedure. \rTheoretically, the only way to achieve 100%good quality is by 100%inspection; thus, all defects are screened and only good parts passthroughthe inspectionprocedure.

However, when 100% inspection is done manually, two problems are encountered. The first is the expense involved. Instead of dividing the cost of inspecting the sample over the number of parts in the production run, the unit inspection cost is applied to every part in the batch. Inspection cost sometimes exceeds the cost of making the part. Second, in 100% manual inspection, there are almost always errors associated with the procedure. The error rate depends on the complexity and difficulty of the inspection task and how much judgment is required by the human inspector. These factors are compounded by operator fatigue. Errors mean that a certain number of poor quality parts will be accepted and a certain number of good quality parts will be rejected. Therefore, 100% inspection using manual methods is no guarantee of 100% good quality product. \rAutomated 100% Inspection Automation of the inspection process offers a possible way to overcome the problems associated with 100% manual inspection. Automated inspection is defined as automation of one or more steps in the inspection procedure, such as (1) automated presentation of parts by an automated handling system, with a human operator still performing the actual inspection process (e.g., visually examining parts for flaws); (2) manual loading of parts into an automatic inspection machine; and (3) fully automated inspection cell in which parts are both presented and inspected automatically. Inspection automation can also include (4) computerized data collection from electronic measuring instruments. \rAutomated 100% inspection can be integrated with the manufacturing process to accomplish some action relative to the process. The actions can be one or both of the following: (1) parts sortation, and/or (2) feedback of data to the process. Parts sortation means separating parts into two or more quality levels. The basic sortation includes two levels: acceptable and unacceptable. Some situations require more than two levels, such as acceptable, reworkable, and scrap. Sortation and inspection may be combined in the same station. An alternative approach is to locate one or more inspections along the processing line, and instructions are sent to a sortation station at the end of the line indicating what action is required for each part. \rFeedback of inspection data to the upstream manufacturing operation allows compensating adjustments to be made in the process to reduce variability and improve quality. If inspection measurements indicate that the output is drifting toward one of the tolerance limits (e.g., due to tool wear), corrections can be made to process parameters to move the output toward the nominal value. The output is thereby maintained within a smaller variability range than possible with sampling inspection methods. \r\r42.5.2 CONTACT VERSUS NONCONTACT INSPECTION \rThere are a variety of measurement and gaging technologies available for inspection. The possibilities can be divided into contact and noncontact inspection methods. Contact inspection involves the use of a mechanical probe or other device that makes contact with the object being inspected. By its nature, contact inspection is usually concerned with measuring or gaging some physical dimension of the part. It is accomplished manually or automatically. Most of the traditional measuring and gaging devices described in Chapter 5 relate to contact inspection. An example of an automated contact measuring system is the coordinate measuring machine (Section 42.6.1). \rNoncontact inspection methods utilize a sensor located a certain distance from the object to measure or gage the desired feature(s). Typical advantages of noncontact inspection are (1) faster inspection cycles, and (2) avoidance of damage to the part that might result from contact. Noncontact methods can often be accomplished on the production line without any special handling. By contrast, contact inspection usually requires special positioning of the part, necessitating its removal from the production line. Also, noncontact inspection methods are inherently faster because they employ a stationary probe that does not require positioning for every part. By contrast, contact inspection requires positioning of the contact probe against the part, which takes time.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 42809, "end_char_idx": 47848, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32ae302f-0e4a-4ca7-bddb-f10e7b19e005": {"__data__": {"id_": "32ae302f-0e4a-4ca7-bddb-f10e7b19e005", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/42.txt", "file_name": "42.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 65236, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "be9713fd-6d9c-429e-bf4e-6926e92f2158", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/42.txt", "file_name": "42.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 65236, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "hash": "e660c0eb516f9d2cadeca544fd0c9150539ab64563dbc4354eddff2cb917e86e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3fd417e3-0bb1-4d41-a36d-7d4341f13433", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/42.txt", "file_name": "42.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 65236, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "hash": "dee66c55a51dc655a040352f887eddc9602f23292e9d24ede36289c72b22da8d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d5f996da-186b-461a-a901-bb81c3248508", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ac01fb26b724c8aff5b58b3d8824099726dfdabbe6fa7f9a12e0333141e7bd21", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It is accomplished manually or automatically.

Nonoptical inspection sensors include electrical field techniques, radiation techniques, and ultrasonics (Section 42.6.4). \r\rAdvanced technologies are substituting for manual measuring and gaging techniques in modern manufacturing plants. They include contact and noncontact sensing methods. We begin our coverage with an important contact inspection technology: coordinate measuring machines. \r\r42.6.1 COORDINATE MEASURING MACHINES \rA coordinate measuring machine (CMM) consists of a contact probe and a mechanism to position the probe in three dimensions relative to surfaces and features of a workpart. See Figure 42.5. The location coordinates of the probe can be accurately recorded as it contacts the part surface to obtain part geometry data. \rIn a CMM, the probe is fastened to a structure that allows movement of the probe relative to the part, which is fixtured on a worktable connected to the structure. The structure must be rigid to minimize deflections that contribute to measurement errors. The machine in Figure 42.5 has a bridge structure, one of the most common designs. Special features are used in CMM structures to build high accuracy and precision into the measuring machine, including use of low-friction air-bearings and mechanical isolation of the CMM to reduce vibrations. An important aspect in a CMM is the contact probe and \r\rFIGURE 42.5 \rCoordinate measuring machine.

Modern \u2018\u2018touch-trigger\u2019\u2019 probes have a sensitive electrical contact that emits a signal when the probe is deflected from its neutral position in the slightest amount. On contact, the coordinate positions are recorded by the CMM controller, adjusting for overtravel and probe size. \rPositioning of the probe relative to the part can be accomplished either manually or under computer control. Methods of operating a CMM can be classified as (1) manual control, (2) manual computer-assisted, (3) motorized computer-assisted, and (4) direct computer control. \rIn manual control, a human operator physically moves the probe along the axes to contact the part and record the measurements. The probe is free-floating for easy movement. Measurements are indicated by digital read-out, and the operator can record the measurement manually or automatically (paper print-out). Any trigonometric calculations must be made by the operator. The manual computer-assisted CMM is capable of computer data processing to perform these calculations. Types of computations include simple conversions from U.S customary units to SI, determining the angle between two planes, and determining hole-center locations. The probe is still free-floating to permit the operator to bring it into contact with part surfaces. \rMotorized computer-assisted CMMs power drive the probe along the machine axes under operator guidance. A joystick or similar device is used to control the motion. Low-power stepping motors and friction clutches are used to reduce the effects of collisions between probe and part.

A CMM is a general-purpose machine that can be used to inspect a variety of part configurations. \r\r42.6.2 MEASUREMENTS WITH LASERS \rRecall that laser stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Applications of lasers include cutting (Section 26.3.3) and welding (Section 30.4). These applications involve the use of solid-state lasers capable of focusing sufficient power to melt or sublimate the work material. Lasers for measurement applications are low-power gas lasers such as helium-neon, which emits light in the visible range. The light beam from a laser is (1) highly monochromatic, which means the light has a single wave length, and (2) highly collimated, which means the light rays are parallel. These properties have motivated a growing list of laser applications in measurement and inspection. We describe two here. \rScanning Laser Systems The scanning laser uses a laser beam deflected by a rotating mirror to produce a beam of light that sweeps past an object, as in Figure 42.6. A photodetector on the far side of the object senses the light beam during its sweep except for the short time when it is interrupted by the object. This time period can be measured \rFIGURE 42.6 Scanning laser system for measuring diameter of cylindrical workpart; time of interruption of light beam is proportional to diameter D. \r\r\rquickly with great accuracy. A microprocessor system measures the time interruption that is related to the size of the object in the path of the laser beam, and converts the time to a linear dimension. Scanning laser beams can be applied in high production on-line inspection and gaging. Signals can be sent to production equipment to make adjustments in the process and/or activate a sortation device on the production line. Applications of scanning laser systems include rolling-mill operations, wire extrusion, machining, and grinding. \rLaser Triangulation Triangulation is used to determine the distance of an object from two known locations by means of trigonometric relationships of a right triangle. The principle can be applied in dimensional measurements using alaser system, as in Figure 42.7. The laser beam is focused on an object to form a light spot on the surface. A position-sensitive optical detector is used to determine the location of the spot. The angle A of the beam directed at the object and the distance H are fixed and known. Given that the photodetector is located a fixed distance above the worktable, the part depth D in the setup of Figure 42.7 is determined from \rD \u00bc HR \u00bc HL cot A \u00f042:14\u00de \rwhere L is determined by the position of the light spot on the workpart. \r\r42.6.3 MACHINE VISION \rMachine vision involves the acquisition, processing, and interpretation of image data by computer for some useful application.

Vision systems can be classified as two dimensional or three dimensional. Two-dimensional systems view the scene as a 2-D image, which is quite adequate for applications involving a planar object. Examples include dimensional measuring and gaging, verifying the presence of components, and checking for features on a flat (or almost flat) surface. Three-dimensional vision systems are required for applications requiring a3-D analysis of the scene, wherecontours or shapes areinvolved. Themajorityof current applications are 2-D, and our discussion will focus (excuse the pun) on this technology. \rOperation of Machine Vision Systems Operation of a machine vision system consists of three steps, depicted in Figure 42.8: (1) image acquisition and digitization, (2) image processing and analysis, and (3) interpretation. \rImage acquisition and digitizing is accomplished by a video camera connected to a digitizing system to store the image data for subsequent processing. With the camera focused on the subject, an image is obtained by dividingtheviewingareaintoamatrix ofdiscrete picture elements (called pixels), in which each element assumes a value proportional to the \rFIGURE 42.9 Image acquisition and digitizing: \r(a) the scene consists of a dark-colored part against alightbackground;(b)a12 \r12 matrix of pixels imposed on the scene. \r\rlight intensity of that portion of the scene. The intensity value for each pixel is converted to its equivalent digital value by analog-to-digital conversion. Image acquisition and digitizing is depicted in Figure 42.9 for a binary vision system, in which the light intensity is reduced to either of two values (black or white \u00bc 0or 1), as in Table 42.4. The pixel matrix in our illustration is only 12 12; a real vision system would have many more pixels for better resolution. Each set of pixel values is a frame,which consists of the setofdigitized pixel values. The frame is stored in computer memory. The process of reading all the pixel values in a frame is performed 30 times per second in United States, 25 cycle/s in European systems. \rThe resolution of a vision system is its ability to sense fine details and features in the image. This depends on the number of pixelsused. Common pixel arraysinclude 640 (horizontal) 480 (vertical), 1024 768, or 1040 1392 picture elements. The more pixels in the vision system, the higher its resolution. However, system cost increases as pixel count increases. Also, time required to read the pictureelements and process the data increases with number of pixels. In addition to binary vision systems, more sophisticated vision systems distinguish various gray levels in the image thatpermitthem to determine surface characteristics such as texture. Called gray-scale vision,these systems typically use 4,6,or 8 bits of memory. Other vision systems can recognize colors. \r\rTABLE 42.4  Pixe l values  in a bin ary visi on syst em for t he imag e in Fig ure  42.8.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 54222, "end_char_idx": 57817, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26e0816d-c56d-4547-b348-e6a73b449ccb": {"__data__": {"id_": "26e0816d-c56d-4547-b348-e6a73b449ccb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/42.txt", "file_name": "42.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 65236, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "be9713fd-6d9c-429e-bf4e-6926e92f2158", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/42.txt", "file_name": "42.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 65236, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "hash": "e660c0eb516f9d2cadeca544fd0c9150539ab64563dbc4354eddff2cb917e86e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e8751495-917c-4196-92e9-7585ba57b9cb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/42.txt", "file_name": "42.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 65236, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "hash": "cd851eddd2950ea2c2ce24b3334157d15e86eebb0fdb97cc4391f3a760a30594", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7ce2b9e2-3b69-4665-bd47-16921c84197d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f4574db81460faefb317b30c8d84096b6f4ae0ba40788cea807cd2497ba66f1b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "This depends on the number of pixelsused.

Several techniques have been developed to analyze image data, including edge detection and feature extraction. Edge detection involves determining the locations of boundaries between an object and its surroundings. This is accomplished by identifying contrast in light intensity between adjacent pixels at the borders of the object. Feature extraction is concerned with determining feature values of an image. Many machine vision systems identify an object in the image by means of its features. Features of an object include area, length, width, or diameter of the object, perimeter, center of gravity, and aspect ratio. Feature extraction algorithms are designed to determine thesefeatures based on the object\u2019s areaand boundaries. Area of an object can be determined by counting the number of pixels that make up the object.

Interpretation is usually concerned with recognizing the object\u2014identifying the object in the image by comparing it to predefined models or standard values. One common interpretation techniqueistemplatematching,whichreferstomethodsthatcompareoneormorefeaturesof an image with corresponding features of a model (template) stored in computer memory. \rMachine Vision Applications The interpretation function in machine vision is generally related to applications, which divide into four categories: (1) inspection, (2) part identification, (3) visual guidance and control, and (4) safety monitoring. \rInspection is the most important category, accounting for about 90% of all industrial applications. The applications are in mass production, where the time to program and install the system can be divided by many thousands of units. Typical inspection tasks include: (1) dimensional measurement or gaging, which involves measuring or gaging certain dimensions of parts or products moving along a conveyor; (2) verification functions, which include verifying presence of components in an assembled product, presence of a hole in a workpart, and similar tasks; and (3) identification of flaws and defects, such as identifying flaws in a printed label in the form of mislocation, poorly printed text, numbering, or graphics on the label.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 57052, "end_char_idx": 60642, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ce2b9e2-3b69-4665-bd47-16921c84197d": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ce2b9e2-3b69-4665-bd47-16921c84197d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/42.txt", "file_name": "42.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 65236, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "be9713fd-6d9c-429e-bf4e-6926e92f2158", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/42.txt", "file_name": "42.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 65236, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "hash": "e660c0eb516f9d2cadeca544fd0c9150539ab64563dbc4354eddff2cb917e86e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "26e0816d-c56d-4547-b348-e6a73b449ccb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/42.txt", "file_name": "42.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 65236, "creation_date": "2024-08-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-08"}, "hash": "0923be18e2d14152c9ce75b595be922e9d689610c4e4809183db25c69374f033", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e0f3cac7-9eea-4a17-8301-d645c0110fe5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fa65421cf45bbf81ed6a56f525c5aeb25ebcfe82b859500913d4d32413613983", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Machine Vision Applications The interpretation function in machine vision is generally related to applications, which divide into four categories: (1) inspection, (2) part identification, (3) visual guidance and control, and (4) safety monitoring. \rInspection is the most important category, accounting for about 90% of all industrial applications.

Visual guidance and control involves a vision system interfaced with a robot or similar machine to control the movement of the machine. Examples include seam tracking in continuous arc welding, part positioning, part reorientation, and picking parts from a bin. In safety monitoring applications, the vision system monitors the production operation to detect irregularities that might indicate a hazardous condition to equipment or humans. \r\r42.6.4 OTHER NONCONTACT INSPECTION TECHNIQUES \rIn addition to optical inspection methods, there are various nonoptical techniques used in inspection. These include sensor techniques based on electrical fields, radiation, and ultrasonics. \rUnder certain conditions, electrical fields created by an electrical probe can be used for inspection. The fields include reluctance, capacitance, and inductance; they are affected by an object in the vicinity of the probe. In a typical application, the workpart is positioned in a fixed relationship to the probe. By measuring the effect of the object on the electrical field, an indirect measurement of certain part characteristics can be made, such as dimensional features, thickness of sheet material, and flaws (cracks and voids below the surface) in the material. \rRadiation techniques use X-ray radiation to inspect metals and weldments. The amount of radiation absorbed by the metal object indicates thickness and presence of flaws in the part or welded section. For example, X-ray inspection is used to measure thickness of sheet metal in rolling (Section 19.1). Data from the inspection is used to adjust the gap between rolls in the rolling mill. \rUltrasonic techniques use high-frequency sound (>20,000 Hz) to perform various inspection tasks. One of the techniques analyses the ultrasonic waves emitted by a probe and reflected off the object. During the setup for the inspection procedure, an ideal test part is positioned in front of the probe to obtain a reflected sound pattern. This sound pattern is used as the standard against which production parts are subsequently compared. If the reflected pattern from a given part matches the standard, the part is accepted. If a match is not obtained, the part is rejected. \r\r[1] DeFeo, J. A., Gryna, F. M., and Chua, R. C. H.

Manufacturing \rMaking things has been an essential activity of human civilizations since before recorded history. Today, the term manufacturing is used for this activity. For technological and economic reasons, manufacturing is important to the welfare of the United States and most other developed and developing nations. Technology can be defined as the application of science to provide society and its members with those things that are needed or desired. Technology affects our daily lives, directly and indirectly, in many ways. Consider the list of products in Table 1.1. They represent various technologies that help our society and its members to live better. What do all these products have in common? They are all manufac-tured. These technological wonders would not be avail-able to our society if they could not be manufactured. Manufacturing is the critical factor that makes technology possible. \rEconomically, manufacturing is an important means by which a nation creates material wealth. In the United States, the manufacturing industries account for only about 12% of gross domestic product (GDP). A country\u2019s natural resources, such as agricultural lands, mineral deposits, and oil reserves, also create wealth. In the U.S., agriculture, mining, and similar industries account for less than 5% of GDP (agriculture alone is only about 1%). Construction and public utilities make up around 5%. The rest is service industries, which include retail, transportation, banking, communication, education, and government. The service sector accounts for more than 75% of U.S. GDP. Government (federal, state, and local) accounts for more of GDP than the manufacturing sector; however, government services do not create wealth. In the modern global economy, a nation must have a strong manufacturing base (or it must have significant natural resources) if it is to provide a strong economy and a high standard of living for its people. \r\rTABLE \u2022 1.1 Products representing various technologies, most of which affect nearly all of us. \rAthletic shoes  E-book reader  One-piece molded plastic patio chair  \rAutomatic teller machine  Fax machine  Optical scanner  \rAutomatic dishwasher  Hand-held electronic calculator  Personal computer (PC)  \rBallpoint pen  High density PC diskette  Photocopying machine  \rCamcorder  Home security system  Pull-tab beverage cans  \rCell phone  Hybrid gas-electric automobile  Quartz crystal wrist watch  \rCompact disc (CD)  Industrial robot  Self-propelled mulching lawnmower  \rCompact disc player  Ink-jet color printer  Smart phone  \rCompact fluorescent light bulb  LCD and Plasma TVs  Supersonic aircraft  \rContact lenses Digital camera Digital video disc (DVD) Digital video disc player  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine for medical diagnosis Medicines Microwave oven  Tablet computer Tennis racket of composite materials Video games Washing machine and dryer  \r\rThis opening chapter considers some general topics about manufacturing.

What Is Manufacturing? \rThe word manufacture is derived from two Latin words, manus (hand) and factus (make); the combination means made by hand. The English word manufacture is several centuries old, and \u201cmade by hand\u201d accurately described the manual methods used when the word was first coined.1Most modern manufacturing is accomplished by automated and computer-controlled machinery (Historical Note 1.1). \r\r1As a noun, the word manufacture first appeared in English around 1567 A.D. As a verb, it first appeared around 1683 A.D. \rCertainly one significant discovery was the principle of division of labor\u2014dividing the total work into tasks and having individual workers each become a specialist at performing only one task. This principle had been practiced for centuries, but the economist Adam Smith (1723\u20131790) is credited with first explaining its economic significance in The Wealth of Nations. \rThe Industrial Revolution (circa 1760\u20131830) had a major impact on production in several ways. It marked the change from an economy based on agriculture and handicraft to one based on industry and manufacturing. The change began in England, where a series of machines were invented and steam power replaced water, wind, and animal power. These advances gave British industry significant advantages over other nations, and England attempted to restrict export of the new technologies. However, the revolution eventually spread to other European countries and the United States. Several inventions of the Industrial Revolution greatly contributed to the development of manufacturing: (1) Watt\u2019s steam engine\u2014a new power-generating technology for industry; (2) machine tools, starting with John Wilkinson\u2019s boring machine around 1775 (Historical Note 21.1); (3) the spinning jenny, power loom, and other machinery for the textile industry that permitted significant increases in productivity; and (4) the factory system\u2014a new way of organizing large numbers of production workers based on division of labor. \rWhile England was leading the industrial revolution, an important concept was being introduced in the United States: interchangeable parts manufacture. Much credit for this concept is given to Eli Whitney (1765\u20131825), although its importance had been recognized by others [10]. In 1797, Whitney negotiated a contract to produce 10,000 muskets for the U.S. government. The traditional way of making guns at the time was to custom-fabricate each part for a par-ticular gun and then hand-fit the parts together by fil-ing. Each musket was unique, and the time to make it was considerable. Whitney believed that the com-ponents could be made accurately enough to permit parts assembly without fitting. After several years of development in his Connecticut factory, he traveled to Washington in 1801 to demonstrate the principle. He laid out components for 10 muskets before government officials, including Thomas Jefferson, and proceeded to select parts randomly to assemble the guns. No special filing or fitting was required, and all of the guns worked perfectly. The secret be-hind his achievement was the collection of special machines, fixtures, and gages that he had developed in his factory. Interchangeable parts manufacture \rSection 1.1/What Is Manufacturing? \rrequired many years of development before becoming a practical reality, but it revolutionized methods of manufacturing. It is a prerequisite for mass production. Because its origins were in the United States, interchangeable parts production came to be known as the American System of manufacture. \rThe mid-and late 1800s witnessed the expan-sion of railroads, steam-powered ships, and other machines that created a growing need for iron and steel. New steel production methods were devel-oped to meet this demand (Historical Note 6.1). Also during this period, several consumer products were developed, including the sewing machine, bicycle, and automobile. To meet the mass demand for these products, more efficient production methods were required. Some historians identify developments during this period as the Second Industrial Revolution, characterized in terms of its effects on manufacturing systems by (1) mass production, (2) scientific management movement, (3) assembly lines, and (4) electrification of factories. \rIn the late 1800s, the scientific management movement was developing in the United States in response to the need to plan and control the activi-ties of growing numbers of production workers. The movement\u2019s leaders included Frederick W. Taylor (1856\u20131915), Frank Gilbreth (1868\u20131924), and his wife Lillian (1878\u20131972).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3630, "end_char_idx": 8387, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60bce0b7-2a6b-4739-a309-8a58ef84324c": {"__data__": {"id_": "60bce0b7-2a6b-4739-a309-8a58ef84324c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13591c5b-ad4d-448c-8f97-c17f32572240", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "44ec8f31cc4dc602b93b255af38b02fa5182304b41a8db86e47e56d46d9cb0e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e9cbc1a-f260-4ffc-8fc3-2bbcd455cc5c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "3c0c3fb142e69515f81a69de812be6c4705aead9afbbcfea6c06eed2ba24f417", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cadc9396-67a4-4600-96a3-19b5339281a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c84ef8b768c3fd34a80f3190bf1f8dabcee0938e5c8cfcfafe6c2ff0edd9f7b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "New steel production methods were devel-oped to meet this demand (Historical Note 6.1).

Scientific management included several features [3]: (1) motion study, aimed at finding the best method to perform a given task; (2) time study, to establish work standards for a job; (3) extensive use of standards in industry; (4) the piece rate system and similar labor incentive plans; and (5) use of data collection, record keeping, and cost accounting in factory operations. \rHenry Ford (1863\u20131947) introduced the assembly line in 1913 at his Highland Park, Michigan plant. The assembly line made possible the mass production of complex consumer products. Use of assembly line methods permitted Ford to sell a Model T automobile for as little as $500, thus making ownership of cars feasible for a large segment of the U.S. population. \rIn 1881, the first electric power generating station had been built in New York City, and soon electric motors were being used as a power source to operate factory machinery. This was a far more convenient power delivery system than steam engines, which required overhead belts to distribute power to the machines. By 1920, electricity had overtaken steam as the principal power source in U.S. factories. The twentieth century was a time of more technological advances than in all other centuries combined. Many of these developments resulted in the automation of manufacturing. \rheManufacturing Labor  \rprocess  \rStarting \r Processed  $  Value added $$  $$$  \rStarting Material in  Processed  \rmaterial  processing  part  \r(a)  (b)  \rFIGURE 1.1 Two ways to define manufacturing: (a) as a technical process, and (b) as an economic process. \r\r\r\rry\re\ring r\rn\r\r\r1.1.1 MANUFACTURING DEFINED \rAs a field of study in the modern context, manufacturing can be defined two ways, one technologic, and the other economic. Technologically, manufacturing is the application of physical and chemical processes to alter the geometry, properties, and/ or appearance of a given starting material to make parts or products; manufacturing also includes assembly of multiple parts to make products. The processes to accomplish manufacturing involve a combination of machinery, tools, power, and labor, as depicted in Figure 1.1(a). Manufacturing is almost always carried out as a sequence of operations. Each operation brings the material closer to the desired final state. \rEconomically, manufacturing is the transformation of materials into items of greater value by means of one or more processing and/or assembly operations, as depicted in Figure 1.1(b). The key point is that manufacturing adds value to the material by changing its shape or properties, or by combining it with other materials that have been similarly altered. The material has been made more valuable through the manufacturing operations performed on it. When iron ore is converted into steel, value is added. When sand is transformed into glass, value is added. When petroleum is refined into plastic, value is added. And when plastic is molded into the complex geometry of a patio chair, it is made even more valuable. \rFigure 1.2 shows a product on the left and the starting workpiece from which the circular frame of the product was produced on the right.

Yet when used in the context of products such as metal parts or automobiles, either word seems okay. \r\r1.1.2 MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES AND PRODUCTS \rManufacturing is an important commercial activity performed by companies that sell products to customers. The type of manufacturing done by a company depends on the kinds of products it makes. \rManufacturing Industries Industry consists of enterprises and organizations that produce or supply goods and services. Industries can be classified as primary, second-ary, or tertiary. Primary industries cultivate and exploit natural resources, such as agriculture and mining.Secondary industries take the outputs of the primary industries and convert them into consumer and capital goods. Manufacturing is the principal activity in this category, but construction and power utilities are also included. Tertiary industries constitute the service sector of the economy. A list of specific industries in these categories is presented in Table 1.2. \rTABLE \u2022 1.2 Specific industries in the primary, secondary, and tertiary categories. \r\rThis book is concerned with the secondary industries in Table 1.2, which include the companies engaged in manufacturing. However, the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) used to compile Table 1.2 includes several industries whose production technologies are not covered in this text; for example, beverages, chemicals, and food processing. In this book, manufacturing means production of hardware, which ranges from nuts and bolts to digital computers and military weapons. Plastic and ceramic products are included, but apparel, paper, pharmaceuticals, power utilities, publishing, and wood products are excluded. \rManufactured Products Final products made by the manufacturing industries can be divided into two major classes: consumer goods and capital goods. Consumer goods are products purchased directly by consumers, such as cars, personal comput-ers, TVs, tires, and tennis rackets. Capital goods are those purchased by companies to produce goods and/or provide services. Examples of capital goods include aircraft, computers, communication equipment, medical apparatus, trucks and buses, railroad locomotives, machine tools, and construction equipment. Most of these capital goods are purchased by the service industries. It was noted in the introduction that manu-facturing accounts for about 12% of gross domestic product and services about 75% of GDP in the United States. Yet the manufactured capital goods purchased by the service sector are the enablers of that sector. Without the capital goods, the service industries could not function. \rIn addition to final products, other manufactured items include the materials, components, tools, and supplies used by the companies that make the final products. Examples of these items include sheet steel, bar stock, metal stampings, machined parts, plastic moldings and extrusions, cutting tools, dies, molds, and lubricants.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 11137, "end_char_idx": 15828, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d452d80c-93d1-477d-a4c5-d83600397ed2": {"__data__": {"id_": "d452d80c-93d1-477d-a4c5-d83600397ed2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13591c5b-ad4d-448c-8f97-c17f32572240", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "44ec8f31cc4dc602b93b255af38b02fa5182304b41a8db86e47e56d46d9cb0e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cadc9396-67a4-4600-96a3-19b5339281a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "5fabf2f337da29df155f5159ad2a00fe5138cb8e44323671523cf03e854aca2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fa49e97f-830c-4294-a098-127793c51ae6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b7219dbc4bdf2a90adfba56823101e608c0b1fcaa7c6f68663240d1d571dd484", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Capital goods are those purchased by companies to produce goods and/or provide services.

Examples of these items include sheet steel, bar stock, metal stampings, machined parts, plastic moldings and extrusions, cutting tools, dies, molds, and lubricants. Thus, the manufacturing industries consist of a complex infrastructure with various categories and layers of intermediate suppliers with whom the final consumer never deals. \rThis book is generally concerned with discrete items\u2014individual parts and assembled products rather than items produced by continuous processes. A metal stamping is a discrete item, but the sheet-metal coil from which it is made is continuous (almost). Many discrete parts start out as continuous or semicontinuous products, such as extrusions and electrical wire. Long sections made in almost continuous lengths are cut to the desired size. An oil refinery is a better example of a continuous process. \rProduction Quantity and Product Variety The quantity of products made by a factory has an important influence on the way its people, facilities, and procedures are organized. Annual production quantities can be classified into three ranges: (1) low production, quantities in the range 1 to 100 units per year; (2) medium production, from 100 to 10,000 units annually; and (3) high production, 10,000 to millions of units. The boundaries between the three ranges are somewhat arbitrary (author\u2019s judgment). Depending on the kinds of products, these boundaries may shift by an order of magnitude or so. \rProduction quantity refers to the number of units produced annually of a particular product type. Some plants produce a variety of different product types, each type being made in low or medium quantities. Other plants specialize in high production of only one product type. It is instructive to identify product variety as a parameter distinct from production quantity. Product variety refers to different product designs or types that are produced in the plant. Different products have different shapes and \r\rsizes; they perform different functions; they are intended for different markets; some have more components than others; and so forth. The number of different product types made each year can be counted. When the number of product types made in the factory is high, this indicates high product variety. \rThere is an inverse correlation between product variety and production quantity in terms of factory operations. If a factory\u2019s product variety is high, then its production quantity is likely to be low; but if production quantity is high, then product variety will be low, as depicted in Figure 1.3. Manufacturing plants tend to specialize in a combination of production quantity and product variety that lies somewhere inside the diagonal band in Figure 1.3. \rAlthough product variety has been identified as a quantitative parameter (the number of different product types made by the plant or company), this parameter is much less exact than production quantity because details on how much the designs differ are not captured simply by the number of different designs. Differences between an automobile and an air conditioner are far greater than between an air conditioner and a heat pump. Within each product type, there are differences among specific models. \rThe extent of the product differences may be small or great, as illustrated in the automotive industry. Each of the U.S. automotive companies produces cars with two or three different nameplates in the same assembly plant, although the body styles and other design features are virtually the same. In different plants, the company builds heavy trucks. The terms \u201csoft\u201d and \u201chard\u201d might be used to describe these differences in product variety. Soft product variety occurs when there are only small differences among products, such as the differences among car models made on the same production line. In an assembled product, soft variety is characterized by a high proportion of common parts among the models. Hard product variety occurs when the products differ substantially, and there are few common parts, if any.

These three building blocks\u2014materials, processes, and systems\u2014 constitute the subject of modern manufacturing. There is a strong interdependence among these factors. A company engaged in manufacturing cannot do everything. \rIt must do only certain things, and it must do those things well. Manufacturing capability refers to the scope of technical and physical capabilities and limitations of a manufacturing company and each of its plants. Manufacturing capability has three dimensions: (1) technological processing capability, (2) physical size and weight of product, and (3) production capacity. \rTechnological Processing Capability The technological processing capabil-ity of a plant (or company) is its available set of manufacturing processes. Certain plants perform machining operations, others roll steel billets into sheet stock, and others build automobiles. A machine shop cannot roll steel, and a rolling mill can-not build cars. The underlying feature that distinguishes these plants is the processes they can perform. Technological processing capability is closely related to material type. Certain manufacturing processes are suited to certain materials, whereas other processes are suited to other materials. By specializing in a certain process or group of processes, the plant is simultaneously specializing in certain material types. Technological processing capability includes not only the physical processes, but also the expertise possessed by plant personnel in these processing technologies. Companies must concentrate on the design and manufacture of products that are compatible with their technological processing capability. \rPhysical Product Limitations A second aspect of manufacturing capability is imposed by the physical product. A plant with a given set of processes is limited in terms of the size and weight of the products that can be accommodated. Large, heavy products are difficult to move. To move these products about, the plant must be equipped with cranes of the required load capacity. Smaller parts and products made in large quantities can be moved by conveyor or other means. The limitation on product size and weight extends to the physical capacity of the manufacturing equipment as well. Production machines come in different sizes. Larger machines must be used to process larger parts. The production and material handling equipment must be planned for products that lie within a certain size and weight range. \rProduction Capacity A third limitation on a plant\u2019s manufacturing capability is the production quantity that can be produced in a given time period (e.g., month or year). This quantity limitation is commonly called plant capacity, or production capacity, defined as the maximum rate of production that a plant can achieve under assumed operating conditions. The operating conditions refer to number of shifts per week, hours per shift, direct labor manning levels in the plant, and so on. These factors represent inputs to the manufacturing plant. Given these inputs, how much output can the factory produce? \rPlant capacity is usually measured in terms of output units, such as annual tons of steel produced by a steel mill, or number of cars produced by a final assembly plant. In these cases, the outputs are homogeneous. In cases in which the output units are not homogeneous, other factors may be more appropriate measures, such as avail-able labor hours of productive capacity in a machine shop that produces a variety of parts. \rMaterials, processes, and systems are the basic building blocks of manufacturing and the three broad subject areas of this book. This introductory chapter provides an overview of these three subjects before embarking on a detailed coverage in the remaining chapters. \r\r\r\rMaterials in Manufacturing \rMost engineering materials can be classified into one of three basic categories: \r(1) metals, (2) ceramics, and (3) polymers.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 18816, "end_char_idx": 23915, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e16e5bcb-7c7e-4593-ab56-ba8ac9876be2": {"__data__": {"id_": "e16e5bcb-7c7e-4593-ab56-ba8ac9876be2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13591c5b-ad4d-448c-8f97-c17f32572240", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "44ec8f31cc4dc602b93b255af38b02fa5182304b41a8db86e47e56d46d9cb0e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa49e97f-830c-4294-a098-127793c51ae6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "97a66a472dd5a536633293db6b4dc8502a7bffd691455f501d9c7ef446136c36", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d3918f2a-b050-4e06-a9df-55bf57fb6bae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5b08d763debe8b4536e93c05b7a5cf9954b28a761e2399a5fb43c128c42318af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These factors represent inputs to the manufacturing plant.

This introductory chapter provides an overview of these three subjects before embarking on a detailed coverage in the remaining chapters. \r\r\r\rMaterials in Manufacturing \rMost engineering materials can be classified into one of three basic categories: \r(1) metals, (2) ceramics, and (3) polymers. Their chemistries are different, their mechanical and physical properties are different, and these differences affect the manufacturing processes that can be used to produce products from them. In addition to the three basic categories, there are (4) composites\u2014nonhomogeneous mixtures of the other three basic types rather than a unique category. The classification of the four groups is pictured in Figure 1.4. This section provides a survey of these materials. Chapters 6 through 9 cover the four material types in more detail. \r1.2.1 METALS \rMetals used in manufacturing are usually alloys, which are composed of two or more elements, with at least one being a metallic element. Metals and alloys can be divided into two basic groups: (1) ferrous, and (2) nonferrous. \r\rFIGURE 1.4 \rClassification of the four engineering materials. \rFerrous Metals Ferrous metals are based on iron; the group includes steel and cast iron. These metals constitute the most important group commercially, more than three-fourths of the metal tonnage throughout the world. Pure iron has limited com-mercial use, but when alloyed with carbon, iron has more uses and greater commer-cial value than any other metal. Alloys of iron and carbon form steel and cast iron. \rSteel can be defined as an iron\u2013carbon alloy containing 0.02% to 2.11% carbon. It is the most important category within the ferrous metal group. Its composition often includes other alloying elements as well, such as manganese, chromium, nickel, and molybdenum, to enhance the properties of the metal. Applications of steel include construction (bridges, I-beams, and nails), transportation (trucks, rails, and rolling stock for railroads), and consumer products (automobiles and appliances). \rCast iron is an alloy of iron and carbon (2% to 4%) used in casting (primarily sand casting). Silicon is also present in the alloy (in amounts from 0.5% to 3%), and other elements are often added also, to obtain desirable properties in the cast part. Cast iron is available in several different forms, of which gray cast iron is the most common; its applications include blocks and heads for internal combustion engines. \rNonferrous Metals Nonferrous metals include the other metallic elements and their alloys. In almost all cases, the alloys are more important commercially than the pure metals. The nonferrous metals include the pure metals and alloys of aluminum, copper, gold, magnesium, nickel, silver, tin, titanium, zinc, and other metals. \r\r1.2.2 CERAMICS \rA ceramic is defined as a compound containing metallic (or semimetallic) and nonmetallic elements. Typical nonmetallic elements are oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon. Ceramics include a variety of traditional and modern materials.

Different methods of manufacturing are required for the two types. Crystalline ceramics are formed in various ways from powders and then fired (heated to a temperature below the melting point to achieve bonding between the powders). The glass ceramics (namely, glass) can be melted and cast, and then formed in processes such as traditional glass blowing. \r\r1.2.3 POLYMERS \rA polymer is a compound formed of repeating structural units called mers, whose atoms share electrons to form very large molecules. Polymers usually consist of carbon plus one or more other elements such as hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and chlorine. Polymers are divided into three categories: (1) thermoplastic polymers, \r(2) thermosetting polymers, and (3) elastomers. \rThermoplastic polymers can be subjected to multiple heating and cooling cycles without substantially altering the molecular structure of the polymer. Common thermoplastics include polyethylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, and nylon. Thermosetting polymers chemically transform (cure) into a rigid structure upon cooling from a heated plastic condition; hence the name thermosetting. Members of this type include phenolics, amino resins, and epoxies. Although the name \u201cthermosetting\u201d is used, some of these polymers cure by mechanisms other than heating. Elastomers are polymers that exhibit significant elastic behavior; hence the name elastomer. They include natural rubber, neoprene, silicone, and polyurethane. \r\r1.2.4 COMPOSITES \rComposites do not really constitute a separate category of materials; they are mixtures of the other three types. A composite is a material consisting of two or more phases that are processed separately and then bonded together to achieve properties superior to those of its constituents. The term phase refers to a homogeneous mass of material, such as an aggregation of grains of identical unit cell structure in a solid metal. The usual structure of a composite consists of particles or fibers of one phase mixed in a second phase, called the matrix. \rComposites are found in nature (e.g., wood), and they can be produced synthetically. The synthesized type is of greater interest here, and it includes glass fibers in a polymer matrix, such as fiber-reinforced plastic; polymer fibers of one type in a matrix of a second polymer, such as an epoxy-Kevlar composite; and ceramic in a metal matrix, such as a tungsten carbide in a cobalt binder to form a cemented carbide cutting tool. \rProperties of a composite depend on its components, the physical shapes of the components, and the way they are combined to form the final material. Some composites combine high strength with light weight and are suited to applications such as aircraft components, car bodies, boat hulls, tennis rackets, and fishing rods. Other composites are strong, hard, and capable of maintaining these properties at elevated temperatures, for example, cemented carbide cutting tools. \r\rManufacturing Processes \rA manufacturing process is a designed procedure that results in physical and/or chemical changes to a starting work material with the intention of increasing the value of that material. A manufacturing process is usually carried out as a unit oper-ation, which means that it is a single step in the sequence of steps required to trans-form the starting material into a final product.

A manufacturing process is usually carried out as a unit oper-ation, which means that it is a single step in the sequence of steps required to trans-form the starting material into a final product. Manufacturing operations can be divided into two basic types: (1) processing operations and (2) assembly operations. A processing operation transforms a work material from one state of completion to a more advanced state that is closer to the final desired product. It adds value by changing the geometry, properties, or appearance of the starting material. In general, processing operations are performed on discrete work parts, but certain processing operations are also applicable to assembled items (e.g., painting a spot-welded car body). An assembly operation joins two or more components to create a new entity, called an assembly, subassembly, or some other term that refers to the joining process (e.g., a welded assembly is called a weldment). A classification of manufacturing processes is presented in Figure 1.5. Some of the basic processes used in modern manufacturing date from antiquity (Historical Note 1.2). \r\r\rProperty Heat enhancing processes treatment \r\r\r\r\rFIGURE 1.5 \rClassification of manufacturing processes. \r\r\rbut iron ore was also mined. Temperatures required to reduce iron ore to metal are significantly higher than for copper, which made furnace operations more difficult. Other processing methods were also more difficult for the same reason. Early blacksmiths learned that when certain irons (those containing small amounts of carbon) were sufficiently heated and then quenched, they became very hard. This permitted grinding a very sharp cutting edge on knives and weapons, but it also made the metal brittle. Toughness could be increased by reheating at a lower temperature, a process known as tempering. What we have described is, of course, the heat treatment of steel. The superior properties of steel caused it to succeed bronze in many applications (weaponry, agriculture, and mechanical devices). The period of its use has subsequently been named the Iron Age (starting around 1000 B.C.). It was not until much later, well into the nineteenth century, that the demand for steel grew significantly and more modern steelmaking techniques were developed (Historical Note 6.1). \rThe beginnings of machine tool technology occurred during the Industrial Revolution. During the period 1770\u20131850, machine tools were developed for most of the conventional material removal processes, such as boring, turning, drilling, milling, shaping, and planing (Historical Note 21.1). Many of the individual processes predate the machine tools by centuries; for example, drilling and sawing (of wood) date from ancient times, and turning (of wood) from around the time of Christ. \rAssembly methods were used in ancient cultures to make ships, weapons, tools, farm implements, \r1.3.1 PROCESSING OPERATIONS \rmachinery, chariots and carts, furniture, and garments. The earliest processes included binding with twine and rope, riveting and nailing, and soldering. Around 2000 years ago, forge welding and adhesive bonding had been developed. Widespread use of screws, bolts, and nuts as fasteners\u2014so common in today\u2019s assembly\u2014required the development of machine tools that could accurately cut the required helical shapes (e.g., Maudsley\u2019s screw cutting lathe, 1800). It was not until around 1900 that fusion welding proc-esses started to be developed as assembly techniques (Historical Note 28.1). \rNatural rubber was the first polymer to be used in manufacturing (if we exclude wood, which is a polymer composite). The vulcanization process, discovered by Charles Goodyear in 1839, made rubber a useful engineering material (Historical Note 8.2). Subsequent developments included plastics such as cellulose nitrate in 1870, Bakelite in 1900, polyvinylchloride in 1927, polyethylene in 1932, and nylon in the late 1930s (Historical Note 8.1).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 30150, "end_char_idx": 34644, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a3fb75c-2828-4dde-99fa-658f3f2f3c22": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a3fb75c-2828-4dde-99fa-658f3f2f3c22", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13591c5b-ad4d-448c-8f97-c17f32572240", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "44ec8f31cc4dc602b93b255af38b02fa5182304b41a8db86e47e56d46d9cb0e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "119ce860-49e3-45a3-909c-8180070da106", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "eb1989b3868fd8955a45dbfabf84a7728c1bfae580810faf1e52905ce33f4802", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cfc77e47-f39d-4dcd-9773-c1934ba88858", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2d0c0612bfc697f44362b4d3127003510e741d6d2540197321d4b39358066df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It was not until around 1900 that fusion welding proc-esses started to be developed as assembly techniques (Historical Note 28.1). \rNatural rubber was the first polymer to be used in manufacturing (if we exclude wood, which is a polymer composite).

Processing requirements for plastics led to the development of injection molding (based on die casting, one of the metal casting processes) and other polymer shaping techniques. \rElectronics products have imposed unusual demands on manufacturing in terms of miniaturization. The evolution of the technology has been to package more and more devices into a smaller area\u2014in some cases millions of transistors onto a flat piece of semiconductor material that is only 12 mm (0.50 in) on a side. The history of electronics processing and packaging dates from around 1960 (Historical Notes 33.1, 34.1, and 34.2). \rA processing operation uses energy to alter a work part\u2019s shape, physical properties, or appearance to add value to the material. The forms of energy include mechanical, thermal, electrical, and chemical. The energy is applied in a controlled way by means of machinery and tooling. Human energy may also be required, but the human workers are generally employed to control the machines, oversee the operations, and load and unload parts before and after each cycle of operation. A general model of a processing operation is illustrated in Figure 1.1(a). Material is fed into the process, energy is applied by the machinery and tooling to transform the material, and the completed work part exits the process. Most production operations produce waste or scrap, either as a natural aspect of the process (e.g., removing material as in machining) or in the form of occasional defective pieces. It is an important objective in manufacturing to reduce waste in either of these forms. \rMore than one processing operation is usually required to transform the starting material into final form. The operations are performed in the particular sequence required to achieve the geometry and condition defined by the design specification. \rThree categories of processing operations are distinguished: (1) shaping operations, (2) property-enhancing operations, and (3) surface processing operations. Shaping operations alter the geometry of the starting work material by various methods. Common shaping processes include casting, forging, and machining. Property-enhancing operations add value to the material by improving its physical properties without changing its shape. Heat treatment is the most common example. Surface processing operations are performed to clean, treat, coat, or deposit material onto the exterior surface of the work. Common examples of coating are plating and painting. Shaping processes are covered in Parts III through VI, corresponding to the four main categories of shaping processes in Figure 1.5. Property-enhancing processes and surface processing operations are covered in Part VII. \rShaping Processes Most shape processing operations apply heat, mechanical force or a combination of these to effect a change in geometry of the work material. There are various ways to classify the shaping processes. The classification used in this book is based on the state of the starting material, by which there are four categories: \r(1) solidification processes, in which the starting material is a heated liquid or semif-luid that cools and solidifies to form the part geometry; (2) particulate processing, in which the starting material is a powder, and the powders are formed and heated into the desired geometry; (3) deformation processes, in which the starting material is a ductile solid (commonly metal) that is deformed to shape the part; and (4) material removal processes, in which the starting material is a solid (ductile or brittle), from which material is removed so that the resulting part has the desired geometry. \rIn the first category, the starting material is heated sufficiently to transform it into a liquid or highly plastic (semifluid) state. Nearly all materials can be processed in this way. Metals, ceramic glasses, and plastics can all be heated to sufficiently high temperatures to convert them into liquids. With the material in a liquid or semifluid form, it can be poured or otherwise forced to flow into a mold cavity and allowed to solidify, thus taking a solid shape that is the same as the cavity.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 34069, "end_char_idx": 38798, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfc77e47-f39d-4dcd-9773-c1934ba88858": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfc77e47-f39d-4dcd-9773-c1934ba88858", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13591c5b-ad4d-448c-8f97-c17f32572240", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "44ec8f31cc4dc602b93b255af38b02fa5182304b41a8db86e47e56d46d9cb0e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8a3fb75c-2828-4dde-99fa-658f3f2f3c22", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "a449def59f860e8a6d15905ee4e82b5dfec4cceaddd0aee7230262c609eadc8f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0838be9c-0930-47b5-92db-c4dfd0b8ff72", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8d1cdfe010477e8703158bce7835709ac15cf7ca53f648ea51ef3da53546c3ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In the first category, the starting material is heated sufficiently to transform it into a liquid or highly plastic (semifluid) state.

With the material in a liquid or semifluid form, it can be poured or otherwise forced to flow into a mold cavity and allowed to solidify, thus taking a solid shape that is the same as the cavity. Most processes that operate this way are called casting or molding. Casting is the name used for metals, and molding is the common term used for plastics. This category of shaping process is depicted in Figure 1.6. Figure 11.1 shows a cast iron casting, and a collection of plastic molded parts is displayed in Figure 13.20. \rIn particulate processing, the starting materials are powders of metals or ceramics. Although these two materials are quite different, the processes to shape them in particulate processing are quite similar.The common technique in powder \rFIGURE 1.6 Castingand molding processes start with a work material heated to a fluid or semifluid state. The process consists of\r(1) \rpouring the fluid into a mold cavity and\r\r(2) \rallowing the fluid tosolidify, after which thesolid part is removedfrom the mold. \r\r\r\rFIGURE 1.7 \rParticulate processing: \r(1) \rthe starting material is powder; the usualprocess consists of\r\r(2) \rpressing and \r\r(3) \rsintering. \r\r\rFIGURE 1.8 Some common deformation processes: (a) forging,in which two halves of a die squeeze thework part, causing it toassume the shape ofthe die cavity; and\r(b) extrusion, in whicha billet is forced to flow through a die orifice, thus taking the cross-sectional shape of theorifice. \r\rmetallurgy involves pressing and sintering, illustrated in Figure 1.7, in which the powders are first squeezed into a die cavity under high pressure and then heated to bond the individual particles together. Examples of parts produced by powder metallurgy are shown in Figure 15.1. \rIn the deformation processes, the starting work part is shaped by the application of forces that exceed the yield strength of the material. For the material to be formed in this way, it must be sufficiently ductile to avoid fracture during deformation. To increase ductility (and for other reasons), the work material is often heated before forming to a temperature below the melting point. Deformation processes are associated most closely with metalworking and include operations such as forging and extrusion, shown in Figure 1.8. Figure 18.19 shows a forging operation performed by a drop hammer. \rAlso included within the deformation processes category is sheet metalworking, which involves bending, forming, and shearing operations performed on starting blanks and strips of sheet metal. Several sheet metal parts, called stampings because they are made on a stamping press, are illustrated in Figure 19.35. \rMaterial removal processes are operations that remove excess material from the starting workpiece so that the resulting shape is the desired geometry.

These cutting operations are most commonly applied to solid metals, performed using cutting tools that are harder and stronger than the work metal.The front cover of this book shows a turning operation. Grinding is another common material removal process. Other processes in this category are known as nontraditional processes because they use lasers, electron beams, chemical erosion, electric discharges, and electrochemical energy to remove \rmaterial rather than cutting or grinding tools. \rIt is desirable to minimize waste and scrap in converting a starting work part into its subsequent geometry. Certain shaping processes are more efficient than others in terms of material conservation. Material removal processes (e.g., machining) tend to be wasteful of material, simply by the way they work. The material removed from the starting shape is waste, at least in terms of the unit operation. Other processes, such as certain casting and molding operations, often convert close to 100% of the start-ing material into final product. Manufacturing processes that transform nearly all of the starting material into product and require no subsequent machining to achieve final part geometry are called net shape processes. Other processes require mini-mum machining to produce the final shape and are called near net shape processes. \rProperty-Enhancing Processes The second major type of part processing is performed to improve mechanical or physical properties of the work material. These processes do not alter the shape of the part, except unintentionally in some cases. The most important property-enhancing processes involve heat treatments, which include various annealing and strengthening processes for metals and glasses. Sintering of powdered metals is also a heat treatment that strengthens a pressed powder metal work part. Its counterpart in ceramics is called firing. \rSurface Processing Surface processing operations include (1) cleaning, (2) surface treatments, and (3) coating and thin film deposition processes. Cleaning includes both chemical and mechanical processes to remove dirt, oil, and other contaminants from the surface. Surface treatments include mechanical working such as shot peening and sand blasting, and physical processes such as diffusion and ion implanta-tion. Coating and thin film deposition processes apply a coating of material to the exterior surface of the work part. Common coating processes include electroplating, \ranodizing of aluminum, organic coating (call it painting), and porcelain enameling. Thin film deposition processes include physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition to form extremely thin coatings of various substances. \rSeveral surface-processing operations have been adapted to fabricate semiconductor materials into integrated circuits for microelectronics. These processes include chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, and oxidation. They are applied to very localized areas on the surface of a thin wafer of silicon (or other semiconductor material) to create the microscopic circuit. \r1.3.2 ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS \rThe second basic type of manufacturing operation is assembly, in which two or more separate parts are joined to form a new entity. Components of the new entity are connected either permanently or semipermanently. Permanent joining processes include welding, brazing, soldering, and adhesive bonding. They form a joint between components that cannot be easily disconnected. Certain mechanical assembly methods are available to fasten two (or more) parts together in a joint that can be conveniently disassembled. The use of screws, bolts, and other threaded fasteners are important traditional methods in this category. Other mechanical assembly techniques form a more permanent connection; these include rivets, press fitting, and expansion fits. Special joining and fastening methods are used in the assembly of electronic products. Some of the methods are identical to or are adaptations of the preceding processes, for example, soldering. Electronics assembly is concerned primarily with the assembly of components such as integrated circuit packages to printed circuit boards to produce the complex circuits used in so many of today\u2019s products. Joining and assembly processes are discussed in Part VIII, and the specialized assembly techniques for electronics are described in Chapter 34. \r1.3.3 PRODUCTION MACHINES AND TOOLING \rManufacturing operations are accomplished using machinery and tooling (and people).

Machine tools are among the most versatile of all production machines. They are used to make not only parts for consumer products, but also components for other production machines. Both in a historic and a reproductive sense, the machine tool is the mother of all machinery. \rOther production machines include presses for stamping operations, forge hammers for forging, rolling mills for rolling sheet metal, welding machines for welding, and insertion machines for inserting electronic components into printed circuit boards.The name of the equipment usually follows from the name of the process. \rProduction equipment can be general purpose or special purpose. General purpose equipment is more flexible and adaptable to a variety of jobs. It is commercially availa-ble for any manufacturing company to invest in. Special purpose equipment is usually designed to produce a specific part or product in very large quantities.

This is not the only reason for special purpose equipment, but it is the dominant one. Another reason may be because the process is unique and commercial equipment is not available. Some companies with unique processing requirements develop their own special purpose equipment. \rProduction machinery usually requires tooling that customizes the equipment for the particular part or product. In many cases, the tooling must be designed specifically for the part or product configuration. When used with general purpose equipment, it is designed to be exchanged. For each work part type, the tooling is fastened to the machine and the production run is made. When the run is completed, the tooling is changed for the next work part type. When used with special purpose machines, the tooling is often designed as an integral part of the machine. Because the special purpose machine is likely being used for mass production, the tooling may never need changing except for replacement of worn components or for repair of worn surfaces. \rThe type of tooling depends on the type of manufacturing process. In Table 1.3, \rwe list examples of special tooling used in various operations. Details are provided \rin the chapters that discuss these processes. \rProduction Systems \rTo operate effectively, a manufacturing firm must have systems that allow it to efficiently accomplish its type of production. Production systems consist of people, equipment, and procedures designed for the combination of materials and processes that constitute a firm\u2019s manufacturing operations.

In general, direct labor workers are responsible for operating the manufacturing equipment; and professional staff workers are responsible for manufacturing support. \r1.4.1 PRODUCTION FACILITIES \rProduction facilities consist of the factory and the production, material handling, and other equipment in the factory. The equipment comes in direct physical contact with the parts and/or assemblies as they are being made. The facilities \u201ctouch\u201d the product. Facilities also include the way the equipment is arranged in the factory\u2014 the plant layout. The equipment is usually organized into logical groupings. In this book they are called manufacturing systems, such as an automated production line, or a machine cell consisting of an industrial robot and two machine tools. \rA manufacturing company attempts to design its manufacturing systems and organize its factories to serve the particular mission of each plant in the most efficient way. Over the years, certain types of production facilities have come to be recognized as the most appropriate way to organize for a given combination of product variety and production quantity, as discussed in Section 1.1.2. Different types of facilities are required for each of the three ranges of annual production quantities. \rLow-Quantity Production In the low-quantity range (1\u2013100 units/year), the term job shop is often used to describe the type of production facility. A job shop makes low quantities of specialized and customized products. The products are typically complex, such as space capsules, prototype aircraft, and special machinery. The equipment in a job shop is general purpose, and the labor force is highly skilled. \rA job shop must be designed for maximum flexibility to deal with the wide product variations encountered (hard product variety). If the product is large and heavy, and therefore difficult to move, it typically remains in a single location during its fabrication or assembly. Workers and processing equipment are brought to the product, rather than moving the product to the equipment. This type of layout is referred to as a fixed-position layout, shown in Figure 1.11(a). In a pure situation, the product \r\r(a) (b) \rWorker \rWorkstation Equipment Conveyor \r\rWorkers \r(c) (d) \rFIGURE 1.11 Various types of plant layout: (a) fixed-position layout, (b) process layout, (c) cellular layout, and\r(d) product layout. \rremains in a single location during its entire production. Examples of such products include ships, aircraft, locomotives, and heavy machinery. In actual practice, these items are usually built in large modules at single locations, and then the completed modules are brought together for final assembly using large-capacity cranes. \rThe individual components of these large products are often made in factories in which the equipment is arranged according to function or type. This arrangement is called a process layout. The lathes are in one department, the milling machines are in another department, and so on, as in Figure 1.11(b). Different parts, each requiring a different operation sequence, are routed through the departments in the particular order needed for their processing, usually in batches. The process layout is noted for its flexibility; it can accommodate a great variety of operation sequences for different part configurations. Its disadvantage is that the machinery and methods to produce a part are not designed for high efficiency. \rMedium Quantity Production In the medium-quantity range (100\u201310,000 units annually), two different types of facility are distinguished, depending on product variety.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 50109, "end_char_idx": 55070, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9842fb8e-db92-45a7-bd3b-0a0a16b4b281": {"__data__": {"id_": "9842fb8e-db92-45a7-bd3b-0a0a16b4b281", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13591c5b-ad4d-448c-8f97-c17f32572240", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "44ec8f31cc4dc602b93b255af38b02fa5182304b41a8db86e47e56d46d9cb0e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "08c1732c-2c8e-40f5-af1c-0396ce44f360", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "38e144bd99039f330cd3c39d0ab95fd5ac47bd6d3629e3f0de9917733d9f6298", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b38c9441-4824-4129-9ece-3a88c93c8c23", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0002f70f8213a018ecf7aec1cc33f282961f2a88d6d95144e31362ea56841c85", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The individual components of these large products are often made in factories in which the equipment is arranged according to function or type.

Its disadvantage is that the machinery and methods to produce a part are not designed for high efficiency. \rMedium Quantity Production In the medium-quantity range (100\u201310,000 units annually), two different types of facility are distinguished, depending on product variety. When product variety is hard, the usual approach is batch production, in which a batch of one product is made, after which the manufacturing equipment is changed over to produce a batch of the next product, and so on. The production rate of the equipment is greater than the demand rate for any single product type, and so the same equipment can be shared among multiple products. The changeover between production runs takes time\u2014time to change tooling and set up the machin-ery. This setup time is lost production time, and this is a disadvantage of batch manu-facturing. Batch production is commonly used for make-to-stock situations, in which \ritems are manufactured to replenish inventory that has been gradually depleted by demand.Theequipmentisusually arrangedinaprocesslayout,asinFigure 1.11(b). An alternative approach to medium-range production is possible if product variety is soft. In this case, extensive changeovers between one product style and the next may not be necessary. It is often possible to configure the manufacturing system so that groups of similar products can be made on the same equipment without significant lost time because of setup. The processing or assembly of different parts or products is accomplished in cells consisting of several workstations or machines. The term cellular manufacturing is often associated with this type of production. Each cell is designed to produce a limited variety of part configurations; that is, the \rcell specializes in the production of a given set of similar parts, according to the principles of group technology (Section 39.5). The layout is called a cellular layout, depicted in Figure 1.11(c). \rHigh Production The high-quantity range (10,000 to millions of units per year) is referred to as mass production. The situation is characterized by a high demand rate for the product, and the manufacturing system is dedicated to the production of that single item. Two categories of mass production can be distinguished: quantity produc-tion and flow line production. Quantity production involves the mass production of single parts on single pieces of equipment. It typically involves standard machines (e.g., stamping presses) equipped with special tooling (e.g., dies and material handling devices), in effect dedicating the equipment to the production of one part type. Typical layouts used in quantity production are the process layout and cellular layout. \rFlow line production involves multiple pieces of equipment or workstations arranged in sequence, and the work units are physically moved through the sequence to complete the product. The workstations and equipment are designed specifically for the product to maximize efficiency. The layout is called a product layout, and the workstations are arranged into one long line, as in Figure 1.11(d), or into a series of connected line segments. The work is usually moved between stations by mechanized conveyor. At each station, a small amount of the total work is completed on each unit of product. \rThe most familiar example of flow line production is the assembly line, associated with products such as cars and household appliances. The pure case of flow line production occurs when there is no variation in the products made on the line. Every product is identical, and the line is referred to as a single model production line. To successfully market a given product, it is often beneficial to introduce feature and model variations so that individual customers can choose the exact merchandise that appeals to them.

The pure case of flow line production occurs when there is no variation in the products made on the line. Every product is identical, and the line is referred to as a single model production line. To successfully market a given product, it is often beneficial to introduce feature and model variations so that individual customers can choose the exact merchandise that appeals to them.

These functions are accomplished by manufacturing sup-port systems\u2014people and procedures by which a company manages its production \roperations. Most of these support systems do not directly contact the product, but they plan and control its progress through the factory. Manufacturing support functions are often carried out in the firm by people organized into departments such as the following: \r\u27a2 \rManufacturing engineering. The manufacturing engineering department is responsible for planning the manufacturing processes\u2014deciding what processes should be used to make the parts and assemble the products. This department is also involved in designing and ordering the machine tools and other equipment used by the operating departments to accomplish processing and assembly. \r\r\u27a2 \rProduction planning and control. This department is responsible for solv-ing the logistics problem in manufacturing\u2014ordering materials and purchased parts, scheduling production, and making sure that the operating departments have the necessary capacity to meet the production schedules. \r\r\u27a2 \rQuality control. Producing high-quality products should be a top priority of any manufacturing firm in today\u2019s competitive environment. It means designing and building products that conform to specifications and satisfy or exceed customer expectations. Much of this effort is the responsibility of the QC department. \r\r\r\rManufacturing Economics \rIn Section 1.1.1, manufacturing was defined as a transformation process that adds value to a starting work material. In Section 1.1.2, we noted that manufacturing is a commercial activity performed by companies that sell products to customers. It is appropriate to consider some of the economic aspects of manufacturing, and that is the purpose of this section. Our coverage consists of (1) production cycle time analysis and (2) manufacturing cost models. \r\r1.5.1 PRODUCTION CYCLE TIME ANALYSIS \r\u201cTime is money\u201d, as the saying goes. The total time to make a product is one of the components that determine its total cost and the price that can be charged for it. The total time is the sum of all of the individual cycle times of the unit operations needed to manufacture the product. As defined in Section 1.3, a unit operation is a single step in the sequence of steps required to make the final product. The cycle time of a unit operation is defined as the time that one work unit spends being processed or assembled. It is the time interval between when one work unit begins the operation and the next unit begins. A typical production cycle time consists of the actual processing time plus the work handling time, for example, loading and unloading the part in the machine. In some processes, such as machining, time is also required to periodically change the tooling used in the operation when it wears out. In equation form, \rTc = To 1 Th 1 Tt (1.1) \rwhere Tc = cycle time of the unit operation, min/pc; To = actual processing time in the operation, min/pc; Th = work handling time, min/pc; and Tt = tool handling time if that applies in the operation, min/pc. As indicated, the tool handling time usually occurs periodically, not every cycle, so the time per workpiece must be determined by dividing the actual time associated with changing the tool by the number of pieces \rbetween tool changes. It should be mentioned that many production operations do not include a tool change, so that term is omitted from Equation (1.1) in those cases. Batch and job shop production are common types of manufacturing.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 58012, "end_char_idx": 62827, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a936d88f-a712-4116-bb11-93427617c4ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "a936d88f-a712-4116-bb11-93427617c4ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13591c5b-ad4d-448c-8f97-c17f32572240", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "44ec8f31cc4dc602b93b255af38b02fa5182304b41a8db86e47e56d46d9cb0e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b38c9441-4824-4129-9ece-3a88c93c8c23", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "ea1c450e4551abdab236bfc70606e9a09ee0d13b11e00212f965650ca8ae67f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "498f575e-6d15-4cb9-a161-e5aa76caa7f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b85dc074a67aea690a33ff70448598a0735d3321a236e5c7aa3c0d5e1fe6f914", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In some processes, such as machining, time is also required to periodically change the tooling used in the operation when it wears out.

It should be mentioned that many production operations do not include a tool change, so that term is omitted from Equation (1.1) in those cases. Batch and job shop production are common types of manufacturing. The time \rto produce a batch of parts in a unit operation consists of the time to set up for the \rbatch plus the actual run time.This can be summarized as follows: \rTb = Tsu + QTc (1.2) \rwhere Tb = total time to complete the batch, min/batch; Tsu = setup time, min/batch; Q = batch quantity, number of pieces (pc); and Tc = cycle time as defined in Equation (1.1), min/pc. To obtain a realistic value of the average production time per piece, the setup time is spread over the batch quantity, as follows: \rT = Tsu + T Tsu + QTc Tb (1.3) \r== \rpc\rQ QQ \rwhere Tp = average production time per piece, min/pc; and the other terms are defined above. \rIf the batch size is one part, then Equations (1.2) and (1.3) are still applicable, and \rQ = 1. In high production (mass production), these equations can also be used, but \rthe value of Q is so large that the setup time loses significance: As Q \u2192 oo, Tsu/Q \u2192 0. \rThe average production time per piece in Equation (1.3) can be used to determine the actual average production rate in the operation: \r60\rRp = Tp (1.4) \rwhere Rp = average hourly production rate, pc/hr. This production rate includes the effect of setup time. During the production run (after the machine is set up), the production rate is the reciprocal of the cycle time: \r60\rRc = (1.5) \rTc \rwhere Rc = hourly cycle rate, cycles/hr or pc/hr. These equations indicate that the cycle rate will always be larger than the actual production rate unless the setup time is zero (Rc > Rp). \r\r1.5.2 MANUFACTURING COST MODELS \rIn this section, the cycle time analysis is used to estimate the costs of production, which include not only the cost of time but also material and overhead. The cost of time consists of labor and equipment costs, which are applied to the average production time per piece as cost rates (e.g., $/hr). Thus, our cost model for production cost per piece can be stated as follows: \rCpc = Cm + (CL + Ceq)Tp + Ct (1.6) \rwhere Cpc = cost per piece, $/pc; Cm = starting material cost, $/pc; CL = labor cost rate, $/min; Ceq = equipment cost rate, $/min; Ct = cost of tooling that is used in the unit operation, $/pc; and Tp = average production time per piece, min/pc. If applicable, the cost of tooling Ct must be determined by dividing the actual cost of the tooling by the number of pieces between tool changes. \rOverhead Costs The two cost rates, CL and Ceq, include overhead costs, which consist of all of the expenses of operating the company other than material, labor, and equipment. Overhead costs can be divided into two categories: (1) factory overhead and (2) corporate overhead. Factory overhead consists of the costs of running the factory excluding materials, direct labor, and equipment. This overhead category includes plant supervision, maintenance, insurance, heat and light, and so forth. A worker who operates a piece of equipment may earn an hourly wage of $15/hr, but when fringe benefits and other overhead costs are figured in, the worker may cost the company $30/hr.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 61991, "end_char_idx": 65839, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "498f575e-6d15-4cb9-a161-e5aa76caa7f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "498f575e-6d15-4cb9-a161-e5aa76caa7f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13591c5b-ad4d-448c-8f97-c17f32572240", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "44ec8f31cc4dc602b93b255af38b02fa5182304b41a8db86e47e56d46d9cb0e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a936d88f-a712-4116-bb11-93427617c4ba", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "5cc90092e1196e108046a62d3b508874f20cd2e0dff5577e5c3899ef39f6b552", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e51b096d-70da-43e0-a5c4-20a845390a8b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d1689fbae857b2fa01f9894eb4154708babd9ee63199d5d0e2608e1204a96cdc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If applicable, the cost of tooling Ct must be determined by dividing the actual cost of the tooling by the number of pieces between tool changes. \rOverhead Costs The two cost rates, CL and Ceq, include overhead costs, which consist of all of the expenses of operating the company other than material, labor, and equipment. Overhead costs can be divided into two categories: (1) factory overhead and (2) corporate overhead. Factory overhead consists of the costs of running the factory excluding materials, direct labor, and equipment. This overhead category includes plant supervision, maintenance, insurance, heat and light, and so forth. A worker who operates a piece of equipment may earn an hourly wage of $15/hr, but when fringe benefits and other overhead costs are figured in, the worker may cost the company $30/hr. Corporate overhead consists of company expenses not related to the factory, such as sales, marketing, accounting, legal, engineering, research and development, office space, utilities, and health benefits.3 These functions are required in the company, but they are not directly related to the cost of manufacturing. On the other hand, for pricing the product, they must be added in, or else the company will lose money on every product it sells. \rJ Black [1] offers some estimates of the typical costs associated with manufacturing a product, presented in Figure 1.12. Several observations are worth making here. First, total manufacturing costs constitute only 40% of the product\u2019s selling price. Corporate overhead expenses (Engineering, Research and development, Administration, sales, marketing, etc.) add up to almost as much as manufacturing cost. Second, parts and materials are 50% of total manufacturing cost, so that is about 20% of selling price. Third, direct labor is only about 12% of manufacturing cost, so that is less than 5% of selling price. Factory overhead, which includes the categories Plant and machinery, depreciation, energy at 26% and Indirect labor at 12%, adds up to more than three times Direct labor cost. \rThe issue of overhead costs can become quite complicated. A more complete treatment can be found in [7] and most introductory accounting textbooks. Our approach in this book is simply to include an appropriate overhead expense in our labor and equipment cost rates. For example, the labor cost rate is \rRH\rC = (1 + R ) (1.7) \rL LOH \r60 \rwhere CL = labor cost rate, $/min; RH = worker\u2019s hourly wage rate, $/hr; and RLOH = labor overhead rate, %. \rResearch and development Administration,sales, marketing, Manufacturing cost Engineering etc. Profit \r3Health benefits, if available from the company, are fringe benefits that apply to all regular employees, and so they would be included in the direct labor overhead in the factory as well as the corporate offices. \r\rEquipment Cost Rate The cost of production equipment used in the factory is a fixed cost, meaning that it remains constant for any level of production output. It is a capital investment that is made in the hope that it will pay for itself by producing a revenue stream that ultimately exceeds its cost. The company puts up the money to purchase the equipment as an initial cost, and then the equipment pays back over a certain number of years until it is replaced or disposed of. This is different from direct labor and material costs, which are variable costs, meaning they are paid for as they are used. Direct labor cost is a cost per time ($/min), and Material cost is a cost per piece ($/pc). \rIn order to determine an equipment cost rate, the initial cost plus installation cost of the equipment must be amortized over the number of minutes it is used during its lifetime. The equipment cost rate is defined by the following: \rIC\rCeq = (1 + ROH) (1.8) \r60NH \rwhere Ceq = equipment cost rate, $/min; IC = initial cost of the equipment, $; N = anticipated number of years of service; H = annual number of hours of operation, hr/yr; and ROH = applicable overhead rate for the equipment, %. \rExample 1.1 Equipment cost rate \rA production machine is purchased for an initial cost plus installation of $500,000. Its anticipated life = 7 years. The machine is planned for a two-shift operation,eight hours per shift,and five days per week.Assume 50 weeksper year.The applicable overhead rate on this type of equipment = 35%.

Time to load and unload each workpiece = 1.60 min.Tool cost = $4.40, and each tool can be used for 20 pieces before it is changed, which takes 2.0 min.

Determine (a) the cycle time for the piece, (b) average production rate when setup time is figured in, and (c) cost per piece. \rSolution: (a) For Equation (1.1), processing time To = 3.72 min, part handling time Th = 1.50 min, and tool handling time Tt = 2.00 min/20 = 0.10 min. \rTc = 3.72 + 1.60 + 0.10 = 5.42 min/pc \r\r\rEquipment reliability and scrap rate of parts are sometimes issues in production. Equipment reliability is represented by the term availability (denoted by the symbol A), which is simply the proportion uptime of the equipment. For example, if A = 97%, then for every 100 hours of machine operation, we would expect on average that the machine would be running for 97 hours and be down for maintenance and repairs for 3 hours. Scrap rate refers to the proportion of parts produced that are defective. Let q denote the scrap rate. In batch production, more than the specified batch quantity are often produced to compensate for the losses due to scrap. Let Q = the required quantity of parts to be delivered and Qo = the starting quantity. The following equation can be used to determine how many starting parts are needed on average to satisfy an order for Q finished parts: \rQ\rQo = (1.9) \r1 -q \rExample 1.3 Scrap rate \rA customer has ordered a batch of 1,000 parts to be produced by a machine shop. Historical data indicates that the scrap rate on this type of part = 4%.

In this section, we want to focus on developments that are of more recent vintage, say within the last 25 to 50 years. The discussion is organized around the following topic areas: \r(1) \rmicroelectronics, (2) computerization of manufacturing, (3) flexible manufacturing, (4) microfabrication and nanotechnology, (5) lean production and Six Sigma, \r\r(6) \rglobalization, and (7) environmentally conscious manufacturing. \r\r\rMicroelectronics Microelectronics involves electronic devices that are fabricated on a microscopic scale. Examples include integrated circuits, which consist of components such as transistors, diodes, and resistors that have been fabricated and electrically connected on a small flat chip, usually made of silicon. The remarkable feature about today\u2019s microelectronics devices is the huge number of components that can be contained onto the chip. The capability to fabricate integrated circuits dates from the early 1960s and has advanced to the point where the current technology is called giga-scale integration, meaning that chips are being produced consisting of billions of components. Microelectronics has become so pervasive that a large proportion of the common items used today are based on this technology. Two thirds of the products listed in Table 1.1 are either called electronics products or their function and operation depend on electronics. In this book, the fabrication of integrated circuits is covered in Chapter 33 and electronics assembly in Chapter 34. \rComputerization of Manufacturing The first digital computers date from the mid-1940s, but their applications in manufacturing came quite a few years later.

In this book, the fabrication of integrated circuits is covered in Chapter 33 and electronics assembly in Chapter 34. \rComputerization of Manufacturing The first digital computers date from the mid-1940s, but their applications in manufacturing came quite a few years later. In the mid-1960s direct numerical control was developed, in which mainframe com-puters were employed to remotely control machine tools in factories. As computer technology developed, enabled by advances in microelectronics, the cost of comput-ers and data processing was reduced, leading to the widespread use of personal com-puters, not only in the office but also in the factory for tasks ranging from control of individual equipment on the shop floor to control of the information required to manage the entire enterprise. The Internet has allowed manufacturing companies to communicate among their own geographically distributed plants and offices, and it has also provided access to customers and suppliers around the world. In this book, several aspects of computerization of manufacturing are included in Parts X and XI on manufacturing systems (Chapters 37 and 38) and manufacturing support systems (Chapters 39 and 40). \rFlexible Manufacturing During most of the twentieth century, the emphasis in the manufacturing industries in the United States was on mass production to satisfy the consumer demands of a rapidly growing population. Mass production is still widely used in the United States and throughout the world, but computerization has enabled manufacturing companies to develop systems that are able to cope with product variations. The reader encountered several instances of this manufacturing flexibility in Section 1.4.1 in the discussion of production facilities. Cellular manufacturing and mixed-model assembly lines are two examples of manually operated manufacturing systems that are capable of producing a variety of parts or products without the time-consuming downtime for changeover. The automobile industry, in particular, is designing its final assembly lines so that ever-greater model variations can be accommodated on a single line to meet changing and unpredictable demand patterns. Computerization has also allowed flexibility to be designed into automated systems, examples of which are the flexible manufacturing systems discussed in Sec-tion 38.6. \rClosely related to flexible manufacturing is mass customization, which involves a production system that is capable of producing individualized products for each customer. The customer specifies the model and options, and the product is made to those specifications. Mass customization is discussed in Section 38.6.3. \rMicrofabrication and Nanotechnology Another recent development in manufacturing, closely related to microelectronics, is the introduction of materials and products whose dimensions are sometimes so small that they cannot be seen by the naked eye. In extreme cases, the items cannot even be seen under an optical microscope. Products that are so miniaturized require special fabrication technologies. Microfabrication refers to the processes needed to make parts and products whose features sizes are in the micrometer range (1 mm = 10-3 mm = 10-6m). Examples include ink-jet printing heads, compact discs (CDs and DVDs), and microsensors used in automotive applications (e.g., air-bag deployment sensors). Nanotechnol-ogy refers to materials and products whose feature sizes are in the nanometer scale \r(1 nm = 10-3 mm = 10-6mm = 10-9m), a scale that approaches the size of atoms and molecules. Ultra-thin coatings for catalytic converters, flat screen TV monitors, and cancer drugs are examples of products based on nanotechnology. The technological and economic importance of microscopic and nanoscopic materials and products is expected to increase in the future, and processes are needed to produce them commercially. Chapters 35 and 36 are devoted to these technologies. \rLean Production and Six Sigma These are two programs aimed at improving efficiency and quality in manufacturing. They address demands by customers for products they buy to be both low in cost and high in quality. Lean production and Six Sigma are being widely adopted by companies, especially in the United States. \rLean production is based on the Toyota Production System developed by Toyota Motors in Japan.

Its origins date from the 1950s and 1960s when Toyota began using unconventional approaches to improve quality, reduce inventories, and increase flexibility in its operations. Lean production can be defined simply as \u201cdoing more work with fewer resources.\u201d4 It means that fewer workers and less equipment are used to accomplish more production in less time, and yet achieve higher quality in the final product. The underlying objective of lean production is the elimination of various forms of waste, such as producing defective parts, excessive inventories, and workers waiting. Lean production is described in Sections 39.4 and 39.5 in our chapter on process planning and production control. \rSix Sigma was started in the 1980s at Motorola Corporation in the United States. The objective was to reduce variability in the company\u2019s processes and products to increase customer satisfaction. Today, Six Sigma can be defined as \u201ca quality-focused program that utilizes worker teams to accomplish projects aimed at improving an organization\u2019s operational performance.\u201d5 Six Sigma is discussed in more detail in Section 40.4.2. \rGlobalization and Outsourcing The world is becoming more and more integrated, creating an international economy in which barriers once established by national boundaries have been reduced or eliminated. This has enabled a freer flow of goods and services, capital, technology, and people among regions and countries. Globalization is the term that describes this trend, which was recognized in the late 1980s and is now a dominant economic reality. Of interest here is that once underdeveloped nations such as China, India, and Mexico have developed their manufacturing infrastructures and technologies to a level such that they are now important producers in the global economy. These countries have large populations, and therefore large workforces, and low labor costs. Hourly wages are significantly higher in the United States than in these countries, making it difficult for domestic U.S. companies to compete in many products that require high labor content. Examples include garments, furniture, toys, and electronic consumer products. The result has been a loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States and a gain of related work to these countries. \rOutsourcing is closely related to globalization. In manufacturing, outsourc-ing refers to the use of outside contractors to perform work that was traditionally \r4M. P. Groover, Work Systems and the Methods, Measurement, and Management of Work [8], p. 514. The term lean production was coined by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studied the production operations at Toyota and other automobile companies in the 1980s. 5Ibid, p. 541. \raccomplished in-house. Outsourcing can be done in several ways, including the use of local suppliers. In this case the jobs remain in the United States. Alternatively, \rU.S. companies can outsource to foreign countries, so that parts and products once made in the United States are now made outside the country. In this case U.S. jobs are displaced. Two possibilities can be distinguished: (1) offshore outsourcing, which refers to production in China or other overseas locations and transporting the items by cargo ship to the United States, and (2) near-shore outsourcing, which means the items are made in Canada, Mexico, or Central America and shipped by rail or truck into the United States. \rOutsourcing has resulted in the growth of contract manufacturers, companies that specialize in producing parts, subassemblies, and/or products for other companies. Contract manufacturers have developed expertise and efficiencies in certain manufacturing operations, which means they can likely produce the contracted items at prices that are lower than the production costs of the customer company if it were the producer.

Contract manufacturers have developed expertise and efficiencies in certain manufacturing operations, which means they can likely produce the contracted items at prices that are lower than the production costs of the customer company if it were the producer. Contract manufacturers include both domestic (U.S.) and foreign companies.6 Reasons why a company might prefer to use the services of a contract manufacturer include: (1) the company benefits from cost savings because it does not have to pay the factory expenses associated with production, (2) the company can focus its resources on design and marketing of products rather than manufacturing, and (3) the company may benefit from skills possessed by the contract manufacturer but not by itself. On the other hand, there are risks associated with contract manufacturing by the customer company. In turning over its product designs it loses control over its intellectual property, which might result in the contract manufacturer becoming a competitor. The distinction between a contract manufacturer and a supplier is perhaps subtle. A supplier is usually thought of as a company that provides materials and components for a customer who is engaged in production of a product, whereas a contract manufacturer accomplishes the whole production of the product. It may use suppliers itself. \rChina is of particular interest in this discussion of globalization and outsourcing because of (1) its fast-growing economy (it now boasts the second largest gross domes-tic product in the world), (2) the importance of manufacturing in that economy, and \r(3) the extent to which U.S. companies have outsourced work to China.To take advan-tage of the low labor rates, many U.S. companies have moved much of their production to China (and other east Asian countries). Despite the logistics problems and costs of shipping the goods back into the United States, the result has been lower costs and higher profits for the outsourcing companies, as well as lower prices and a wider variety of available products for American consumers. The downside has been the loss of well-paying manufacturing jobs in the United States. Another consequence of U.S. outsourcing to China has been a reduction in the relative contribution of the manufacturing sector to GDP. In the 1990s, the manufacturing industries accounted for about 20% of GDP in the United States. Today, that contribution is only about 12%. At the same time, the manufacturing sector in China has grown (along with the rest of its economy), now accounting for about 35% of Chinese GDP. \rRecently, there have been signs that outsourcing of production to China by American companies may be declining, and that manufacturing jobs are being brought back to the U.S. There are several reasons for this trend, which is called \r6 The largest contract manufacturer at the time of this writing is Hon Hai Precision Industries (a.k.a. Foxconn, headquartered in Taiwan, but many of its factories are located in China). It ranked 60th in the Fortune Global 500 with sales of $95 billion in 2010 (Fortune, July 25, 2011). \rreshoring. First, wage rates in China are increasing as the government attempts to evolve from an export-driven economy to a consumer-oriented economy, similar to the United States. Higher Chinese wage rates mean less advantage for U.S. compa-nies to offshore jobs to China. Second, logistics costs and delays involved in trans-porting products from China to North America are significant, especially as oil prices increase.

On the other hand, \rU.S. companies producing goods for the Chinese market still have good reasons to keep their operations going in that country, just as Japanese and German automobile makers have established plants in the United States. \rEnvironmentally Conscious Manufacturing An inherent feature of virtually all manufacturing processes is waste (Section 1.3.1). The most obvious examples are material removal processes, in which chips are removed from a starting workpiece to create the desired part geometry. Waste in one form or another is a by-product of nearly all production operations. Another unavoidable aspect of manufacturing is that power is required to accomplish any given process. Generating that power requires fossil fuels (at least in the United States and China), the burning of which results in pollution of the environment. At the end of the manufacturing sequence, a product is created that is sold to a customer. Ultimately, the product wears out and is disposed of, perhaps in some landfill, with the associated environmental degrada-tion. More and more attention is being paid by society to the environmental impact of human activities throughout the world and how modern civilization is using our natural resources at an unsustainable rate. Global warming is presently a major concern. The manufacturing industries contribute to these problems. \rEnvironmentally conscious manufacturing refers to programs that seek to deter-mine the most efficient use of materials and natural resources in production and minimize the negative consequences on the environment. Other terms for these pro-grams include green manufacturing and sustainable manufacturing. They all boil down to two basic approaches: (1) design products that minimize their environmen-tal impact and (2) design processes that are environmentally friendly. \rProduct design is the logical starting point in environmentally conscious manu-facturing. The term design for environment (DFE) is used for the techniques that attempt to consider environmental impact during product design prior to produc-tion. Considerations in DFE include (1) selecting materials that require minimum energy to produce, (2) selecting processes that minimize waste of materials and energy, (3) designing parts that can be recycled or reused, (4) designing products that can be readily disassembled to recover the parts, (5) designing products that minimize the use of hazardous and toxic materials, and (6) giving attention to how the product will be disposed of at the end of its useful life. \rTo a great degree, decisions made during design dictate the materials and processes that are used to make the product. These decisions limit the options available to the manufacturing departments to achieve sustainability. However, various approaches can be applied to make plant operations more environmentally friendly. They include \r(1) adopting good housekeeping practices\u2014keeping the factory clean, (2) preventing pollutants from escaping into the environment (rivers and atmosphere), (3) minimiz-ing waste of materials in unit operations, (4) recycling rather than discarding waste materials, (5) using net shape processes, (6) using renewable energy sources when feasible, (7) maintaining production equipment so that it operates at maximum effi-ciency, and (8) investing in equipment that minimizes power requirements. \rThe Nature of Materials \r\rAn understanding of materials is fundamental in the study of manufacturing processes.

It is the material that is transformed; and it is the behavior of the material when subjected to the particular forces, \r\r2.1 temperatures, and other physical parameters of the process that determines the success of the operation. \r2.2 Bonding between Atoms and Molecules Certain materials respond well to certain types of manufacturing processes and poorly or not at all to others. \r2.3 What are the characteristics and properties of materials that determine their capacity to be transformed by the different processes? \rPart I of this book consists of four chapters that address this question.

For exam-ple, metals almost always exist as crystals in their solid state. Glass (e.g., window glass), a ceramic, assumes a noncrystalline form. Some polymers are mixtures of crystalline and amorphous structures. \rChapters 3 and 4 discuss the mechanical and physical properties that are relevant in manufacturing. Of course, these properties are also important in product design. Chapter 5 is concerned with several part and product \r\r\rattributes that are specified during product design and must be achieved in manufac-turing: dimensions, tolerances, and surface finish. Chapter 5 also describes how these attributes are measured. \rAtomic Structure and the Elements \rThe basic structural unit of matter is the atom. Each atom is composed of a positively charged nucleus, surrounded by a sufficient number of negatively charged electrons so that the charges are balanced. The number of electrons identifies the atomic number and the element of the atom. There are slightly more than 100 elements (not counting a few extras that have been artificially synthesized), and these elements are the chemi-cal building blocks of all matter. \rJust as there are differences among the elements, there are also similarities. The elements can be grouped into families and relationships established between and within the families by means of the Periodic Table, shown in Figure 2.1. In the horizontal direction there is a certain repetition, or periodicity, in the arrange-ment of elements. Metallic elements occupy the left and center portions of the chart, and nonmetals are located to the right. Between them, along a diagonal, is a transition zone containing elements called metalloids or semimetals. In principle, each of the elements can exist as a solid, liquid, or gas, depending on temperature and pressure. At room temperature and atmospheric pressure, they each have a natural phase; e.g., iron (Fe) is a solid, mercury (Hg) is a liquid, and nitrogen (N) is a gas. \r\rIn the table, the elements are arranged into vertical columns and horizontal rows in such a way that similarities exist among elements in the same columns. For example, in the extreme right column are the noble gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon), all of which exhibit great chemical stability and low reaction rates. The halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine) in column VIIA share similar properties (hydrogen is not included among the halogens). The noble metals (copper, silver, and gold) in column IB have similar properties. Generally, there are correlations in properties among elements within a given column, whereas differences exist among elements in different columns. \rMany of the similarities and differences among the elements can be explained by their respective atomic structures. The simplest model of atomic structure, called the planetary model, shows the electrons of the atom orbiting around the nucleus at certain fixed distances, called shells, as shown in Figure 2.2. The hydrogen atom (atomic number 1) has one electron in the orbit closest to the nucleus. Helium (atomic number 2) has two.

Also shown in the figure are the atomic structures for fluorine (atomic number 9), neon (atomic number 10), and sodium (atomic number 11). One might infer from these models that there is a maximum number of electrons that can be contained in a given orbit. This turns out to be correct, and the maximum is defined by \rMaximum number of electrons in an orbit = 2n2 \rwhere n identifies the orbit, with n = 1 closest to the nucleus. \rThe number of electrons in the outermost shell, relative to the maximum number allowed, determines to a large extent the atom\u2019s chemical affinity for other atoms. These outer-shell electrons are called valence electrons. For example, because a hydrogen atom has only one electron in its single orbit, it readily combines with another hydrogen atom to form a hydrogen molecule H2. For the same reason, hydrogen also reacts readily with various other elements (e.g., to form H2O). In the helium atom, the two electrons in its only orbit are the maximum allowed (2n2 = 2(1)2 = 2), and so helium is very stable. Neon is stable for the same reason: Its outermost orbit (n = 2) has eight electrons (the maximum allowed), so neon is an inert gas. \rIn contrast to neon, fluorine has one fewer electron in its outer shell (n = 2) than the maximum allowed and is readily attracted to other elements that might share an electron to make a more stable set. The sodium atom seems divinely made for the situation, with one electron in its outermost orbit. It reacts strongly with fluorine to form the compound sodium fluoride, as pictured in Figure 2.3. \r\r\r\rAt the low atomic numbers considered here, the prediction of the number of electrons in the outer orbit is straightforward. As the atomic number increases to higher levels, the allocation of electrons to the different orbits becomes somewhat more complicated. There are rules and guidelines, based on quantum mechanics, that can be used to predict the positions of the electrons among the various orbits and explain their characteristics. A discussion of these rules is somewhat beyond the scope of this coverage of manufacturing materials. \rBonding between Atoms and Molecules \rAtoms are held together in molecules by various types of bonds that depend on the valence electrons. By comparison, molecules are attracted to each other by weaker bonds, which generally result from the electron configuration in the indi-vidual molecules. Thus, we have two types of bonding: (1) primary bonds, gener-ally associated with the formation of molecules; and (2) secondary bonds, generally associated with attraction between molecules. Primary bonds are much stronger than secondary bonds. \rPrimary Bonds Primary bonds are characterized by strong atom-to-atom attractions that involve the exchange of valence electrons. Primary bonds include the following forms: (a) ionic, (b) covalent, and (c) metallic, as illustrated in Figure 2.4. Ionic and covalent bonds are called intramolecular bonds because they involve attractive forces between atoms within the molecule. \r\r(a) ionic, (b) covalent,and (c) metallic. \rIn the ionic bond, the atoms of one element give up their outer electron(s), which are in turn attracted to the atoms of some other element to increase their electron count in the outermost shell to eight. In general, eight electrons in the outer shell is the most stable atomic configuration (except for the very light atoms), and nature pro-vides a very strong bond between atoms that achieves this configuration. The previous example of the reaction of sodium and fluorine to form sodium fluoride (Figure 2.3) illustrates this form of atomic bond. Sodium chloride (table salt) is a more common example.

The previous example of the reaction of sodium and fluorine to form sodium fluoride (Figure 2.3) illustrates this form of atomic bond. Sodium chloride (table salt) is a more common example. Because of the transfer of electrons between the atoms, sodium and fluorine (or sodium and chlorine) ions are formed, from which this bonding derives its name. Properties of solid materials with ionic bonding include low electrical conductivity and poor ductility. \rThe covalent bond is one in which electrons are shared (as opposed to transferred) between atoms in their outermost shells to achieve a stable set of eight. Fluorine and diamond are two examples of covalent bonds. In fluorine, one electron from each of two atoms is shared to form F2 gas, as shown in Figure 2.5(a). In the case of diamond, which is carbon (atomic number 6), each atom has four neighbors with which it shares electrons. This produces a very rigid three-dimensional structure, not adequately represented in Figure 2.5(b), and accounts for the extreme high hardness of this material. Other forms of carbon (e.g., graphite) do not exhibit this rigid atomic structure. Solids with covalent bonding generally possess high hardness and low electrical conductivity. \rThe metallic bond is, of course, the atomic bonding mechanism in pure metals and metal alloys. Atoms of the metallic elements generally possess too few electrons in their outermost orbits to complete the outer shells for all of the atoms in, say, a given block of metal. Accordingly, instead of sharing on an atom-to-atom basis, metallic bonding involves the sharing of outer-shell electrons by all atoms to form a general electron cloud that permeates the entire block. This cloud provides the attractive forces to hold the atoms together and form a strong, rigid structure in most cases. Because of the general sharing of electrons, and their freedom to move within the metal, metallic bonding provides for good electri-cal conductivity. Other typical properties of materials characterized by metallic bonding include good conduction of heat and good ductility. (Although some of these terms are yet to be defined, the reader\u2019s general understanding of material properties is assumed.) \rSecondary Bonds Whereas primary bonds involve atom-to-atom attractive forces, secondary bonds involve attraction forces between molecules, or intermolecular forces. There is no transfer or sharing of electrons in secondary bonding, and these bonds are \r(a) \rfluorine gas F2, and \r\r(b) \rdiamond. \r\r\r\r\rtherefore weaker than primary bonds. There are three forms of secondary bonding: \r(a) dipole forces, (b) London forces, and (c) hydrogen bonding, illustrated in Figure 2.6. Types (a) and (b) are often referred to as van der Waals forces, after the scientist who first studied and quantified them. \rDipole forces arise in a molecule comprised of two atoms that have equal and opposite electrical charges. Each molecule therefore forms a dipole, as shown in Figure 2.6(a) for hydrogen chloride. Although the material is electrically neu-tral in its aggregate form, on a molecular scale the individual dipoles attract each other, given the proper orientation of positive and negative ends of the molecules. These dipole forces provide a net intermolecular bonding within the material. \rLondon forces involve attractive forces between nonpolar molecules; that is, the atoms in the molecule do not form dipoles in the sense of the preceding paragraph.

When materials solidify from the molten state, they tend to close ranks and pack tightly, in many cases arranging themselves into a very orderly structure, and in other cases, not quite so orderly. Two fundamentally different material structures can be distin-guished: (1) crystalline and (2) noncrystalline. Crystalline structures are examined in this section, and noncrystalline in the next. \rMany materials form into crystals on solidification from the molten or liquid state.

The structure can be viewed in the form of a unit cell, which is the basic geometric grouping of atoms that is repeated. To illustrate, consider the unit cell for the body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure shown in Figure 2.7, one of the common structures found in metals. The simplest model of the BCC unit cell is illustrated in Figure 2.7(a). Although this model clearly depicts the locations of the atoms within the cell, it does not indicate the close packing of the atoms that occurs in the real crystal, as in Figure 2.7(b). Figure 2.7(c) shows the repeating nature of the unit cell within the crystal. \r2.3.1 TYPES OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURES \rIn metals, three lattice structures are common: (1) body-centered cubic (BCC), \r(2) face-centered cubic (FCC), and (3) hexagonal close-packed (HCP), illustrated in Figure 2.8. Crystal structures for the common metals are presented in Table 2.1. It should be noted that some metals undergo a change of structure at different temperatures. Iron, for example, is BCC at room temperature; it changes to FCC above 912\u00b0C (1674\u00b0F) and back to BCC at temperatures above 1400\u00b0C (2550\u00b0F).

A perfect crystal is sometimes desirable to satisfy aesthetic or engineering purposes. For instance, a perfect dia-mond (contains no flaws) is more valuable than one containing imperfections. In the production of integrated circuit chips, large single crystals of silicon possess desirable processing characteristics for forming the microscopic details of the circuit pattern. \rHowever, there are various reasons why a crystal\u2019s lattice structure may not be perfect. The imperfections often arise naturally because of the inability of the solidifying material to continue the replication of the unit cell indefinitely without interruption. Grain boundaries in metals are an example. In other cases, the imperfections are introduced purposely during the manufacturing process, for example, the addition of an alloying ingredient in a metal to increase its strength. \rThe various imperfections in crystalline solids are also called defects. Either term, \rimperfection or defect, refers to deviations in the regular pattern of the crystalline \rlattice structure. They can be catalogued as (1) point defects, (2) line defects, and \r(3) surface defects. \rPoint defects are imperfections in the crystal structure involving either a single atom or a few atoms. The defects can take various forms including, as shown in Figure 2.9: (a) vacancy, the simplest defect, involving a missing atom within the lattice structure; (b) ion-pair vacancy, also called a Schottky defect, which involves \r\r(b) screw dislocation. \rSection 2.3/Crystalline Structures \r\r(a) (b) \ra missing pair of ions of opposite charge in a compound that has an overall charge balance; (c) interstitialcy, a lattice distortion produced by the presence of an extra atom in the structure; and (d) displaced ion, known as a Frenkel defect, which occurs when an ion becomes removed from a regular position in the lattice structure and inserted into an interstitial position not normally occupied by such an ion. \rA line defect is a connected group of point defects that forms a line in the lattice structure. The most important line defect is the dislocation, which can take two forms: (a) edge dislocation and (b) screw dislocation. An edge dislocation is the edge of an extra plane of atoms that exists in the lattice, as illustrated in Figure 2.10(a). A screw dislocation, Figure 2.10(b), is a spiral within the lattice structure wrapped around an imperfection line, like a screw is wrapped around its axis. Both types of dislocations can arise in the crystal structure during solidification (e.g., casting), or they can be initiated during a deformation process (e.g., metal forming) performed on the solid material. Dislocations are useful in explaining certain aspects of mechanical behavior in metals. \rSurface defects are imperfections that extend in two directions to form a boundary. The most obvious example is the external surface of a crystalline object that defines its shape. The surface is an interruption in the lattice structure. Surface boundaries can also lie inside the material. Grain boundaries are the best example of these in-ternal surface interruptions.

This can be likened to a tilting of the lattice structure without any changes of position among the atoms in the lattice, in the manner depicted in Figure 2.11(a) and (b). If the force is removed, the lattice structure (and therefore the crystal) returns to its original shape. If the stress reaches a high value relative to the electrostatic forces holding the atoms in their lattice positions, a permanent shape change occurs, called plastic deformation. What has happened is that the atoms in the lattice have permanently moved from their previous locations, and a new equilibrium lattice has been formed, as suggested by Figure 2.11(c). \r\rThe lattice deformation shown in (c) of the figure is one possible mechanism, called slip, by which plastic deformation can occur in a crystalline structure. The other is called twinning, discussed later. \rSlip involves the relative movement of atoms on opposite sides of a plane in the lattice, called the slip plane. The slip plane must be somehow aligned with the lattice structure (as indicated in the sketch), and so there are certain preferred directions along which slip is more likely to occur. The number of these slip directions depends on the lattice type. The three common metal crystal structures are somewhat more complicated, especially in three dimensions, than the square lattice depicted in Figure \r2.11. It turns out that HCP has the fewest slip directions, BCC the most, and FCC falls in between. HCP metals show poor ductility and are generally difficult to deform at room temperature. Metals with BCC structure would figure to have the highest ductility, if the number of slip directions were the only criterion. However, nature is not so simple. These metals are generally stronger than the others, which complicates the issue, and the BCC metals usually require higher stresses to cause slip. In fact, some of the BCC metals exhibit poor ductility. Low carbon steel is a notable exception; although relatively strong, it is widely used with great commercial success in sheet-metal-forming operations, where it exhibits good ductility. The FCC metals are generally the most ductile of the three crystal structures, combining a good number of slip directions with (usually) relatively low to moderate strength. All three of these metal structures become more ductile at elevated temperatures, and this fact is often exploited in shaping them. \rDislocations play an important role in facilitating slip in metals. When a lattice structure containing an edge dislocation is subjected to a shear stress, the material deforms much more readily than in a perfect structure. This is explained by the fact that the dislocation is put into motion within the crystal lattice in the presence of the stress, as shown in the series of sketches in Figure 2.12. Why is it easier to move a dislocation through the lattice than it is to deform the lattice itself? The answer is that the atoms at the edge dislocation require a smaller displacement within the distorted lattice structure to reach a new equilibrium position. Thus, a lower energy level is needed to realign the atoms into the new positions than if the lattice were missing the dislocation. A lower stress level is therefore required to effect the deformation. Because the new position manifests a similar distorted lattice, movement of atoms at the dislocation continues at the lower stress level. \rThe slip phenomenon and the influence of dislocations have been explained here on a very microscopic basis. On a larger scale, slip occurs many times over \r\rthroughout the metal when subjected to a deforming load, thus causing it to exhibit the familiar macroscopic behavior of stretching, compressing, or bending. Dislocations represent a good-news\u2013bad-news situation. Because of dislocations, the metal is more ductile and yields more readily to plastic deformation (forming) during manufacturing.

However, from a product design viewpoint, the metal is not nearly as strong as it would be in the absence of dislocations. \rTwinning is a second way in which metal crystals plastically deform. Twinning can be defined as a mechanism of plastic deformation in which atoms on one side of a plane (called the twinning plane) are shifted to form a mirror image of the other side of the plane. It is illustrated in Figure 2.13. The mechanism is important in HCP metals (e.g., magnesium, zinc) because they do not slip readily. Besides structure, another factor in twinning is the rate of deformation. The slip mechanism requires more time than twinning, which can occur almost instantaneously. Thus, when the deformation rate is very high, metals twin that would otherwise slip. Low carbon steel is an example that illustrates this rate sensitivity; when subjected to high strain rates it twins, whereas at moderate rates it deforms by slip. \rFIGURE 2.13 Twinninginvolves the formation of an atomic mirror image (i.e., a \u201ctwin\u201d)on the opposite sideof the twinning plane:\r(a) before and (b) after twinning.

Each grain has its own unique lattice orientation; but collectively, the grains are randomly oriented within the block. Such a structure is referred to as polycrystalline. It iseasyto understandhow suchastructureisthenaturalstateofthe material.When the block is cooled from the molten state and begins to solidify, nucleation of individualcrystalsoccurs atrandom positions andorientationsthroughoutthe liquid.As these crystals grow they finally interfere with each other, forming at their interface a surface defect\u2014a grain boundary.The grain boundary consists of a transition zone, perhaps only a few atoms thick, in which the atoms are not aligned with either grain. The size of the grains in the metal block is determined by the number of nucleation sites in the molten material and the cooling rate of the mass, among other factors. In a casting process, the nucleation sites are often created by the relatively cold walls of the mold, which motivates a somewhat preferred grain orientation at these walls. \rGrain size is inversely related to cooling rate: Faster cooling promotes smaller grain size, whereas slower cooling has the opposite effect. Grain size is important in metals because it affects mechanical properties. Smaller grain size is generally preferable from a design viewpoint because it means higher strength and hardness. It is also desirable in certain manufacturing operations (e.g., metal forming), because it means higher ductility during deformation and a better surface on the finished product. \rAnother factor influencing mechanical properties is the presence of grain boundaries in the metal. They represent imperfections in the crystalline structure that interrupt the continued movement of dislocations. This helps to explain why smaller grain size\u2014therefore more grains and more grain boundaries\u2014increases the strength of the metal. By interfering with dislocation movement, grain boundaries also contribute to the characteristic property of a metal to become stronger as it is deformed. The property is called strain hardening, and it is examined more closely in Chapter 3 on mechanical properties. \r\rNoncrystalline (Amorphous) Structures \rMany important materials are noncrystalline\u2014liquids and gases, for example. Water and air have noncrystalline structures. A metal loses its crystalline structure when it is melted.

The property is called strain hardening, and it is examined more closely in Chapter 3 on mechanical properties. \r\rNoncrystalline (Amorphous) Structures \rMany important materials are noncrystalline\u2014liquids and gases, for example. Water and air have noncrystalline structures. A metal loses its crystalline structure when it is melted. Mercury is a liquid metal at room temperature, with its melting point of -38\u00b0C (-37\u00b0F). Important classes of engineering materials have a noncrystalline form in their solid state; the term amorphous is often used to describe these materials. Glass, many plastics, and rubber fall into this category. Many important plastics are mixtures of crystalline and noncrystalline forms. Even metals can be amorphous rather than crystalline, given that the cooling rate during transformation from liquid to solid is fast enough to inhibit the atoms from arranging themselves into their pre-ferred regular patterns. This can happen, for instance, if the molten metal is poured between cold, closely spaced, rotating rolls. \rTwo closely related features distinguish noncrystalline from crystalline materials: \r(1) absence of a long-range order in the molecular structure, and (2) differences in melting and thermal expansion characteristics. \rThe difference in molecular structure can be visualized with reference to Figure 2.14. The closely packed and repeating pattern of the crystal structure is shown on the left;and the less dense and random arrangement of atoms in the noncrystalline \rFIGURE 2.14 Illustration of difference in structure between: (a) crystalline and (b) noncrystalline materials. The crystal structure is regular, repeating,and denser, while the noncrystalline structure is more loosely packed and random. \r\rmaterial on the right. The difference is demonstrated by a metal when it melts. The more loosely packed atoms in the molten metal show an increase in volume (reduction in density) compared with the material\u2019s solid crystalline state. This effect is characteristic of most materials when melted (ice is a notable exception; liquid water is denser than solid ice). It is a general characteristic of liquids and solid amorphous materials that they are absent of long-range order as on the right in our figure. \rThe melting phenomenon will now be examined in more detail, and in doing so, the second important difference between crystalline and noncrystalline structures is illustrated. As indicated above, a metal experiences an increase in volume when it melts from the solid to the liquid state. For a pure metal, this volumetric change occurs rather abruptly, at a constant temperature (i.e., the melting temperature Tm), as indicated in Figure 2.15. The change represents a discontinuity from the slopes on either side in the plot. The gradual slopes characterize the metal\u2019s thermal expansion\u2014the change in volume as a function of temperature, which is usually different in the solid and liquid states. Associated with the sudden volume increase as the metal transforms from solid to liquid at the melting point is the addition of a certain quantity of heat, called the heat of fusion, which causes the atoms to lose the dense, regular arrange-ment of the crystalline structure. The process is reversible; it operates in both direc-tions. If the molten metal is cooled through its melting temperature, the same abrupt change in volume occurs (except that it is a decrease), and the same quantity of heat is given off by the metal. \rAn amorphous material exhibits quite different behavior than that of a pure metal when it changes from solid to liquid, as shown in Figure 2.15. The process is again reversible, but observe the behavior of the amorphous material during cooling from the liquid state, rather than during melting from the solid, as before. Glass (silica, SiO2) is used to illustrate. At high temperatures, glass is a true liquid, and the molecules are free to move about as in the usual definition of a liquid. As the glass cools, it gradually transforms into the solid state, going through a transition phase, called a supercooled liquid, before finally becoming rigid. It does not show the sudden volumetric change that is characteristic of crystalline materials; instead it passes through its melting temperature Tm without a change in its thermal expansion slope. In this supercooled liquid region, the material becomes increasingly viscous as the temperature continues to decrease.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 115537, "end_char_idx": 120145, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35408d5f-a5a8-47cb-b7ac-a111cde0fb9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "35408d5f-a5a8-47cb-b7ac-a111cde0fb9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13591c5b-ad4d-448c-8f97-c17f32572240", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "44ec8f31cc4dc602b93b255af38b02fa5182304b41a8db86e47e56d46d9cb0e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bdf6f6db-e497-4963-8bd6-8a74ecb868d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "83e8b35a178b69a254313c0507be5fee7747b6a582cae8f478dd3af9dfa0facd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2bbc541f-e552-4093-9fcd-bec53e6fdae8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "97817534d1b9f2dbc4321227b5fff291968dda4a322c48c4cb320d0ba0c1f32a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The process is again reversible, but observe the behavior of the amorphous material during cooling from the liquid state, rather than during melting from the solid, as before.

It does not show the sudden volumetric change that is characteristic of crystalline materials; instead it passes through its melting temperature Tm without a change in its thermal expansion slope. In this supercooled liquid region, the material becomes increasingly viscous as the temperature continues to decrease. As it cools further, a point is finally reached at which the supercooled liquid converts to a solid. This is called the glass-transition temperature Tg. At this point, there is a change in the thermal expansion slope. (It might be more precise to refer to it as the thermal contraction slope; however, the slope is the same for expansion and contraction). The rate of thermal expansion is lower for the solid material than for the supercooled liquid. \r\r\rThe difference in behavior between crystalline and noncrystalline materials can be traced to the response of their respective atomic structures to changes in temperature. When a pure metal solidifies from the molten state, the atoms arrange themselves into a regular and recurring structure. This crystal structure is much more compact than the random and loosely packed liquid from which it formed. Thus, the process of solidification produces the abrupt volumetric contraction observed in Figure 2.15 for the crystalline material. By contrast, amorphous materials do not achieve this repeating and closely packed structure at low temperatures. The atomic structure is the same random arrangement as in the liquid state; thus, there is no abrupt volumetric change as these materials transition from liquid to solid. \rEngineering Materials \rThis section summarizes how atomic structure, bonding, and crystal structure (or absence thereof) are related to the type of engineering material: metals, ceramics, and polymers. \rMetals Metals have crystalline structures in the solid state, almost without exception. The unit cells of these crystal structures are almost always BCC, FCC, or HCP. The atoms of the metals are held together by metallic bonding, which means that their valence electrons can move about with relative freedom (compared with the other types of atomic and molecular bonding). These structures and bonding generally make the metals strong and hard. Many of the metals are quite ductile (capable of being deformed, which is useful in manufacturing), especially the FCC metals. Other general properties of metals related to structure and bonding include high electri-cal and thermal conductivity, opaqueness (impervious to light rays), and reflectivity (capacity to reflect light rays). \rCeramics Ceramic molecules are characterized by ionic or covalent bonding, or both. The metallic atoms release or share their outermost electrons to the nonmetallic atoms, and a strong attractive force exists within the molecules. The general properties that result from these bonding mechanisms include high hardness and stiffness (even at elevated temperatures) and brittleness (no ductility). The bonding also means that ceramics are electrically insulating (nonconducting), refractory (thermally resistant), and chemically inert. \rCeramics possess either a crystalline or noncrystalline structure. Most ceramics have a crystal structure, whereas glasses based on silica (SiO2) are amorphous. In certain cases, either structure can exist in the same ceramic material. For example, silica occurs in nature as crystalline quartz. When this mineral is melted and then cooled, it solidifies to form fused silica, which has a noncrystalline structure. \rPolymers A polymer molecule consists of many repeating mers to form very large molecules held together by covalent bonding. Elements in polymers are usu-ally carbon plus one or more other elements such as hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and chlorine. Secondary bonding (van der Waals) holds the molecules together within the aggregate material (intermolecular bonding). Polymers have either a glassy structure or mixture of glassy and crystalline. There are differences among the three polymer types. In thermoplastic polymers, the molecules consist of long chains of mers in a linear structure.

If thermosetting polymers are reheated, they degrade chemically rather than soften. Elastomers have large molecules with coiled struc-tures. The uncoiling and recoiling of the molecules when subjected to stress cycles motivate the aggregate material to exhibit its characteristic elastic behavior. \rThe molecular structure and bonding of polymers provide them with the fol-lowing typical properties: low density, high electrical resistivity (some polymers are used as insulating materials), and low thermal conductivity. Strength and stiff-ness of polymers vary widely. Some are strong and rigid (although not matching the strength and stiffness of metals or ceramics), whereas others exhibit highly elastic behavior. \r\rPhysicalProperties of Materials \rChapter Contents \r4.1 Volumetric and Melting Properties \r4.1.1 Density \r4.1.2 Thermal Expansion \r4.1.3 Melting Characteristics \r4.2 Thermal Properties \r4.2.1 Specific Heat and ThermalConductivity \r4.2.2 Thermal Properties inManufacturing \r4.3 Mass Diffusion \r4.4 Electrical Properties \r4.4.1 Resistivity and Conductivity \r4.4.2 Classes of Materials by ElectricalProperties \r4.5 Electrochemical Processes \rPhysical properties, as the term is used here, defines the behavior of materials in response to physical forces other than mechanical. They include volumetric, thermal, electrical, and electrochemical properties. Components in a product must do more than simply withstand mechanical stresses. They must conduct electricity (or prevent its conduction), allow heat to be transferred (or allow it to escape), transmit light (or block its transmission), and satisfy myriad other functions. \rPhysical properties are important in manufacturing because they often influence the performance of the process. For example, thermal properties of the work material in machining determine the cutting temperature, which affects how long the tool can be used before it fails. In microelectronics, electrical properties of silicon and the way in which these properties can be altered by various chemical and physical processes comprise the basis of semiconductor manufacturing. \rThis chapter covers the physical properties that are most important in manufacturing\u2014properties that are encountered in subsequent chapters of the book.

Its symbol is r, and typical units are g/cm3 (lb/in3). The density of an element is determined by its atomic number and other factors such as atomic radius and atomic packing. The term specific gravity expresses the density of a material relative to the density of water and is therefore a ratio with no units. \rDensity is an important consideration in the selection of a material for a given application, but it is generally not the only property of interest.

The density of an element is determined by its atomic number and other factors such as atomic radius and atomic packing. The term specific gravity expresses the density of a material relative to the density of water and is therefore a ratio with no units. \rDensity is an important consideration in the selection of a material for a given application, but it is generally not the only property of interest. Strength is also important, and the two properties are often related in a strength-to-weight ratio, which is the tensile strength of the material divided by its density. The ratio is useful in comparing materials for structural applications in aircraft, automobiles, and other products in which weight and energy are of concern. \r4.1.2 THERMAL EXPANSION \rThe density of a material is a function of temperature. The general relationship is that density decreases with increasing temperature. Put another way, the volume per \runit weight increases with temperature. Thermal expansion is the name given to this effect that temperature has on density. It is usually expressed as the coefficient of thermal expansion, which measures the change in length per degree of temperature, as mm/mm/\u00b0C (in/in/\u00b0F). It is a length ratio rather than a volume ratio because this is easier to measure and apply. It is consistent with the usual design situation in which dimensional changes are of greater interest than volumetric changes. The change in length corresponding to a given temperature change is given by: \rL2 -L1 = aL1(T2 -T1) (4.1) \rwhere a = coefficient of thermal expansion, \u00b0C-1(\u00b0F-1); and L1 and L2 are lengths, mm (in), corresponding, respectively, to temperatures T1 and T2, \u00b0C (\u00b0F). \rValues of coefficient of thermal expansion given in Table 4.1 suggest that it has a linear relationship with temperature. This is only an approximation. Not only is length affected by temperature, but the thermal expansion coefficient itself is also affected. For some materials it increases with temperature; for other materials it decreases. These changes are usually not significant enough to be of much concern, and values like those in the table are quite useful in design calculations for the range of temperatures contemplated in service. Changes in the coefficient are more substantial when the metal undergoes a phase transformation, such as from solid to liquid, or from one crystal structure to another. \rIn manufacturing operations, thermal expansion is put to good use in shrink fit and expansion fit assemblies (Section 31.3), in which a part is heated to increase its size or cooled to decrease its size to permit insertion into some other part. When the part returns to ambient temperature, a tightly fitted assembly is obtained. Thermal expansion can be a problem in heat treatment (Chapter 26) and welding (Section \r29.6) because of thermal stresses that develop in the material during these processes. \r4.1.3 MELTING CHARACTERISTICS \rFor a pure element, the melting point Tm is the temperature at which the mate-rial transforms from solid to liquid state. The reverse transformation, from liquid to solid, occurs at the same temperature and is called the freezing point. For crystalline elements, such as metals, the melting and freezing temperatures are the same. A cer-tain amount of heat energy, called the heat of fusion, is required at this temperature to accomplish the transformation from solid to liquid. \rMelting of a metal element at a specific temperature assumes equilibrium conditions. Exceptions occur in nature; for example, when a molten metal is cooled, it may remain in the liquid state below its freezing point if nucleation of crystals does not initiate immediately.When this happens,the liquid is said to be supercooled. \rThere are other variations in the melting process\u2014differences in the way melt\ring occurs in different materials.

These issues are examined in the discussion of phase diagrams in Chapter 6. \rAnother difference in melting occurs with noncrystalline materials (glasses). In these materials, there is a gradual transition from solid to liquid states. The solid material gradually softens as temperature increases, finally becoming liquid at the melting point. During softening, the material has a consistency of increasing plasticity (increasingly like a fluid) as it gets closer to the melting point. \rThese differences in melting characteristics among pure metals, alloys, and glass are portrayed in Figure 4.1. The plots show changes in density as a function of temperature for three hypothetical materials: a pure metal, an alloy, and glass.

Some typical values are listed in Table 4.2. To determine the amount of energy needed to heat a certain weight of a metal in a furnace to a given elevated temperature, the following equation can be used: \rH = CW (T2 -T1) (4.2) \rwhere H = amount of heat energy, J (Btu); C = specific heat of the material, J/kg \u00b0C (Btu/lb \u00b0F); W = its weight, kg (lb); and (T2 -T1) = change in temperature, \u00b0C (\u00b0F). The volumetric heat storage capacity of a material is often of interest.This is simply density multiplied by specific heat rC. Thus, volumetric specific heat is the heat energy required to raise the temperature of a unit volume of material by one degree, \rJ/mm3 \u00b0C (Btu/in3 \u00b0F). \rConduction is a fundamental heat-transfer process. It involves transfer of thermal energy within a material from molecule to molecule by purely thermal motions; no transfer of mass occurs. The thermal conductivity of a substance is therefore its capa-bility to transfer heat through itself by this physical mechanism.

In some operations heat is the energy that accomplishes the process; in others heat is generated as a consequence of the process. \rSpecific heat is of interest for several reasons. In processes that require heating of the material (e.g., casting, heat treating, and hot metal forming), specific heat determines the amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature to a desired level, according to Equation (4.2). \rIn many processes carried out at ambient temperature, the mechanical energy to perform the operation is converted to heat, which raises the temperature of the work part. This is common in machining and cold forming of metals. The temperature rise is a function of the metal\u2019s specific heat. Coolants are often used in machining to reduce these temperatures, and here the fluid\u2019s heat capacity is critical. Water is almost always employed as the base for these fluids because of its high heat-carrying capacity. \rThermal conductivity functions to dissipate heat in manufacturing processes, sometimes beneficially, sometimes not. In mechanical processes such as metal forming and machining, much of the power required to operate the process is converted to heat. The ability of the work material and tooling to conduct heat away from its source is highly desirable in these processes. \rOn the other hand, high thermal conductivity of the work metal is undesirable in fusion welding processes such as arc welding. In these operations, the heat input must be concentrated at the joint location so that the metal can be melted. For example, copper is generally difficult to weld because its high thermal conductivity allows heat to be conducted from the energy source into the work too rapidly, inhibiting heat buildup for melting at the joint. \r\rMass Diffusion \rIn addition to heat transfer in a material, there is also mass transfer. Mass diffusion involves movement of atoms or molecules within a material or across a boundary between two materials in contact. It is perhaps more appealing to one\u2019s intuition that such a phenomenon occurs in liquids and gases, but it also occurs in solids. It occurs in pure metals, in alloys, and between materials that share a common interface. Because of thermal agitation of the atoms in a material (solid, liquid, or gas), atoms are continuously moving about. In liquids and gases, where the level of thermal agitation is high, it is a free-roaming movement. In solids (metals in particular), the atomic motion is facilitated by vacancies and other imperfections in the crystal structure. \rDiffusion can be illustrated by the series of sketches in Figure 4.2 for the case of two metals suddenly brought into intimate contact with each other.

Given enough time, the assembly of two pieces will finally reach a uniform composition throughout. \rTemperature is an important factor in diffusion. At higher temperatures, thermal agitation is greater and the atoms can move about more freely. Another factor is the concentration gradient dc/dx, which indicates the concentration of the two types of atoms in a direction of interest defined by x. The concentration gradient is plotted in Figure 4.2(b) to correspond to the instantaneous distribution of atoms in the assembly. The relationship often used to describe mass diffusion is Fick\u2019s first law: \rdm =-D (dc) A dt (4.4) \rdt \rwhere dm = small amount of material transferred, D = diffusion coefficient of the metal, which increases rapidly with temperature, dc/dx = concentration gradient, A = area of the boundary, and dt represents a small time increment. An alternative expression of Equation (4.4) gives the mass diffusion rate: \rdm =-D (dc) A (4.5) dt dt \rAlthough these equations are difficult to use in calculations because of the problem of assessing D, they are helpful in understanding diffusion and the variables on which D depends. \rMass diffusion is used in several processes. A number of surface-hardening treat-ments are based on diffusion (Section 26.4), including carburizing and nitriding. Among the welding processes, diffusion welding (Section 29.5.2) is used to join two components by pressing them together and allowing diffusion to occur across the boundary to create a permanent bond. Diffusion is also used in electronics manufac-turing to alter the surface chemistry of a semiconductor chip in microscopic local-ized regions to create circuit details (Section 33.4.3). \r\rElectrical Properties \rEngineering materials exhibit a great variation in their capacity to conduct electric-ity.This section defines the physical properties by which this capacity is measured. \r4.4.1 RESISTIVITY AND CONDUCTIVITY \rThe flow of electrical current involves movement of charge carriers\u2014infinitesimally small particles possessing an electrical charge. In solids, these charge carriers are electrons. In a liquid solution, charge carriers are positive and negative ions. The movement of charge carriers is driven by the presence of an electric voltage and resisted by the inherent characteristics of the material, such as atomic structure and bonding between atoms and molecules.This is the familiar relationship defined by Ohm\u2019s law: \rEI = \r(4.6) \rR \rwhere I = current, A; E = voltage, V; and R = electrical resistance, !1. The resistance in a uniform section of material (e.g., a wire) depends on its length L, cross-sectional area A, and the resistivity of the material r; thus, \rL\rR = r \rA or r = RA (4.7) \rL \rwhere resistivity has units of !1-m2/m or !1-m (!1-in). Resistivity is the basic property thatdefines a material\u2019scapability to resist currentflow.Table 4.3 lists values of resistivity for selected materials. Resistivity is not a constant; instead it varies, as do so many other properties, with temperature. For metals, it increases with temperature. \rIt is often more convenient to consider a material as conducting electrical current rather than resisting its flow. The conductivity of a material is simply the reciprocal of resistivity: \r1\rElectrical conductivity = (4.8) \rr \rwhere conductivity has units of (!1-m)-1 ((!1-in)-1). \r4.4.2 CLASSES OF MATERIALS BY ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES \rMetals are the best conductors of electricity, because of their metallic bonding.

Their applications range from mainframe computers to household appliances and automotive engine controllers. As one would guess, a semiconductor is a material whose resistivity lies between insulators and conductors. The typical range is shown in Table 4.3. The most commonly used semiconductor material today is silicon (Section 7.5.2), largely because of its abundance in nature, relative low cost, and ease of processing. What makes semiconductors unique is the capacity to significantly alter conductivities in their surface chemistries in microscopic areas to fabricate integrated circuits (Chapter 33). \rElectrical properties play an important role in various manufacturing processes. Some of the nontraditional processes use electrical energy to remove material. Electric discharge machining (Section 25.3.1) uses the heat generated by electrical energy in the form of sparks to remove material from metals. Most of the important welding processes use electrical energy to melt the joint metal. Finally, the capacity to alter electrical properties of semiconductor materials is the basis for microelectronics manufacturing. \r\rElectrochemical Processes \rElectrochemistry is a field of science concerned with the relationship between electricity and chemical changes, and with the conversion of electrical and chemical energy. \rIn a water solution, the molecules of an acid, base, or salt are dissociated into positively and negatively charged ions. These ions are the charge carriers in the solution\u2014they allow electric current to be conducted, playing the same role that electrons play in metallic conduction. The ionized solution is called an electrolyte; and electrolytic conduction requires that current enter and leave the solution at electrodes. The positive electrode is called the anode, and the negative electrode is the cathode. The whole arrangement is called an electrolytic cell. At each electrode, some chemical reaction occurs, such as the deposition or dissolution of material, or the decomposition of gas from the solution. Electrolysis is the name given to these chemical changes occurring in the solution. \rConsider a specific case of electrolysis: decomposition of water, illustrated in \rFigure 4.3. To accelerate the process, dilute sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is used as the elec\rtrolyte, and platinum and carbon (both chemically inert) are used as electrodes. The \r=\relectrolyte dissociates in the ions H+ andSO4 .The H+ ions are attracted to the negatively charged cathode; upon reaching it they acquire an electron and combine into molecules of hydrogen gas: \r2H+ + 2e \u2192 H2 (gas) (4.9a) \rThe SO4 = ions are attracted to the anode, transferring electrons to it to form additional sulfuric acid and liberate oxygen: \r2SO =-4e + 2H O \u2192 2H SO + O (gas) (4.9b) \r4 2 242 \rThe product H2SO4 is dissociated into ions of H+ and SO4 = again and so the process continues. \r\rIn addition to the production of hydrogen and oxygen gases, as illustrated by the example, electrolysis is also used in several other industrial processes. Two examples are (1) electroplating (Section 27.3.1), an operation that adds a thin coating of one metal (e.g., chromium) to the surface of a second metal (e.g., steel) for decorative or other purposes; and (2) electrochemical machining (Section 25.2), a process in which material is removed from the surface of a metal part.

In elec-troplating, the work part is set up in the electrolytic circuit as the cathode, so that the positive ions of the coating metal are attracted to the negatively charged part. In elec-trochemical machining, the work part is the anode, and a tool with the desired shape is the cathode.The action of electrolysis in this setup is to remove metal from the part surface in regions determined by the shape of the tool as it slowly feeds into the work. \rThe two physical laws that determine the amount of material deposited or removed from a metallic surface were first stated by the British scientist Michael Faraday: \r1. \rThe mass of a substance liberated in an electrolytic cell is proportional to the quantity of electricity passing through the cell. \r\r2. \rWhen the same quantity of electricity is passed through different electrolytic cells, the masses of the substances liberated are proportional to their chemical equivalents. \r\r\r\rMeasurement \rChapter Contents \r5.1 Dimensions, Tolerances, and Related Attributes \r5.1.1 Dimensions and Tolerances \r5.1.2 Other Geometric Attributes \r5.2 Conventional Measuring Instruments and Gages \r5.2.1 Precision Gage Blocks \r5.2.2 Measuring Instruments for Linear Dimensions \r5.2.3 Comparative Instruments \r5.2.4 Fixed Gages \r5.2.5 Angular Measurements \r5.3 Surfaces \r5.3.1 Characteristics of Surfaces \r5.3.2 Surface Texture \r5.3.3 Surface Integrity \r5.4 Measurement of Surfaces \r5.4.1 Measurement of Surface Roughness \r5.4.2 Evaluation of Surface Integrity \r5.5 Effect of Manufacturing Processes \rIn addition to mechanical and physical properties of materials, other factors that determine the performance of a manufactured product include the dimensions and surfaces of its components. Dimensions are the linear or angular sizes of a component specified on the part drawing. Dimensions are important because they determine how well the components of a product fit together during assembly. When fabricating a given component, it is nearly impossible and very costly to make the part to the exact dimension given on the drawing. Instead a limited variation is allowed from the dimension, and that allowable variation is called a tolerance. \rThe surfaces of a component are also important. They affect product performance, assembly fit, and aesthetic appeal that a potential customer might have for the product. A surface is the exterior boundary of an object with its surroundings, which may be another object, a fluid, or space, or combinations of these. The surface encloses the object\u2019s bulk mechanical and physical properties. \rThis chapter covers dimensions, tolerances, and surfaces\u2014three attributes specified by the product designer and determined by the manufacturing processes that make the parts and products. It also considers how these attributes are assessed using measuring and gaging devices. Closely related topics are quality control and inspection, covered in Chapter 40. \r\r\rDimensions, Tolerances, and Related Attributes \rThe basic parameters used by design engineers to specify sizes of geometric features on a part drawing are defined in this section. The parameters include dimensions and tolerances, flatness, roundness, and angularity. \r5.1.1 DIMENSIONS AND TOLERANCES \rANSI [3] defines a dimension as \u201ca numerical value expressed in appropriate units of measure and indicated on a drawing and in other documents along with lines, symbols, and notes to define the size or geometric characteristic, or both, of a part or part feature.\u201d Dimensions on part drawings represent nominal or basic sizes of the part and its features.

These are the values that the designer would like the part size to be, if the part could be made to an exact size with no errors or variations in the fabrication process. However, there are variations in the manu-facturing process, which are manifested as variations in the part size. Tolerances are used to define the limits of the allowed variation. Quoting again from the ANSI standard [3], a tolerance is \u201cthe total amount by which a specific dimension is permitted to vary. The tolerance is the difference between the maximum and minimum limits.\u201d \rTolerances can be specified in several ways, illustrated in Figure 5.1. Probably most common is the bilateral tolerance, in which the variation is permitted in both positive and negative directions from the nominal dimension. For example, in Figure 5.1(a), the nominal dimension = 2.500 linear units (e.g., mm, in), with an allowable variation of \r0.005 units in either direction. Parts outside these limits are unacceptable. It is pos-sible for a bilateral tolerance to be unbalanced; for example, 2.500 + 0.010, -0.005 dimensional units. A unilateral tolerance is one in which the variation from the speci-fied dimension is permitted in only one direction, either positive or negative, as in Figure 5.1(b). Limit dimensions are an alternative method to specify the permissible variation in a part feature size; they consist of the maximum and minimum dimensions allowed, as in Figure 5.1(c). \r5.1.2 OTHER GEOMETRIC ATTRIBUTES \rDimensions and tolerances are normally expressed as linear (length) values. There are other geometric attributes of parts that are also important, such as flatness of a surface, roundness of a shaft or hole, parallelism between two surfaces, and so on. Definitions of these terms are listed in Table 5.1. \r2.500: (a) bilateral, (b) unilateral, and (c) limit dimensions. \r\rTABLE \u2022 5.1 Definitions of geometric attributes of parts. \rAngularity\u2014The extent to which a part feature suchas a surface or axis is at a specified angle relative toa reference surface. If the angle = 90\u00b0, then the attribute is called perpendicularity or squareness. \rCircularity\u2014For a surface of revolution such as a cylinder, circular hole, or cone, circularity is thedegree to which all points on the intersection of the surface and a plane perpendicular to the axisof revolution are equidistant from the axis. For a sphere, circularity is the degree to which all points on the intersection of the surface and a plane passing through the center are equidistant from the center. \rConcentricity\u2014The degree to which any two (ormore) part features such as a cylindrical surface anda circular hole have a common axis. \rCylindricity\u2014The degree to which all points on a surface of revolution such as a cylinder are equidistantfrom the axis of revolution. \rFlatness\u2014The extent to which all points on a surface \rlie in a single plane. Parallelism\u2014The degree to which all points on a partfeature such as a surface, line, or axis are equidistantfrom a reference plane or line or axis. \rPerpendicularity\u2014The degree to which all points on a part feature such as a surface, line, or axis are 90\u00b0from a reference plane or line or axis. \rRoundness\u2014Same as circularity.

Two systems of units have evolved in the world: (1) the U.S. customary system (U.S.C.S.), and (2) the International System of Units (or SI, for Systeme Internationale d\u2019Unites), more popularly known as the metric system (Historical Note 5.1). Both systems are used in parallel throughout this book. The metric system is widely accepted in nearly every part of the industrialized world except the United States, which has stubbornly clung to its U.S.C.S. Gradually, the United States is adopting SI. \r\r\rMeasurement provides a numerical value of the quantity of interest, within certain limits of accuracy and precision. Accuracy is the degree to which the measured value agrees with the true value of the quantity of interest. A measurement procedure is accurate when it is absent of systematic errors, which are positive or negative deviations from the true value that are consistent from one measurement to the next. Precision is the degree of repeatability in the measurement process. Good precision means that random errors in the measurement procedure are minimized. Random errors are usually associated with human participation in the measurement process. Examples include variations in the setup, imprecise reading of the scale, round-off approximations, and so on. Nonhuman contributors to random error include temperature changes, gradual wear and/or misalignment in the working elements of the device, and other variations. \rClosely related to measurement is gaging. Gaging (also spelled gauging) determines simply whether the part characteristic meets or does not meet the design specification. It is usually faster than measuring, but scant information is provided about the actual value of the characteristic of interest. \rThis section considers the variety of manually operated measuring instruments and gages used to evaluate dimensions such as length and diameter, as well as features such as angles, straightness, and roundness. This type of equipment is found in metrology labs, inspection departments, and tool rooms. The logical starting topic is precision gage blocks. \r5.2.1 PRECISION GAGE BLOCKS \rPrecision gage blocks are the standards against which other dimensional measuring instruments and gages are compared. Gage blocks are usually square or rectangular.Themeasuring surfacesare finished to be dimensionally accurateandparallel to \rwithin several millionths of an inch and are polished to a mirror finish. Several grades of precision gage blocks are available, with closer tolerances for higher precision grades. The highest grade\u2014the master laboratory standard\u2014is made to a tolerance of \u00b10.000,03 mm (\u00b10.000,001 in). Depending on degree of hardness desired and price the user is willing to pay, gage blocks can be made out of any of several hard materi-als, including tool steel, chrome-plated steel, chromium carbide, or tungsten carbide. \rPrecision gage blocks are available in certain standard sizes or in sets, the latter containing a variety of different-sized blocks. The sizes in a set are systematically determined so they can be stacked to achieve virtually any dimension desired to within 0.0025 mm (0.0001 in). \rFor best results, gage blocks must be used on a flat reference surface, such as a surface plate. A surface plate is a large solid block whose top surface is finished to a flat plane. Most surface plates today are made of granite. Granite has the advantage of being hard, non-rusting, nonmagnetic, long wearing, thermally stable, and easy to maintain. \rGage blocks and other high-precision measuring instruments must be used under standard conditions of temperature and other factors that might adversely affect the measurement. By international agreement, 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F) has been established as the standard temperature. Metrology labs operate at this standard. If gage blocks or other measuring instruments are used in a factory environment in which the temperature differs from this standard, corrections for thermal expansion or contraction may be required. Also, working gage blocks used for inspection in the shop are subject to wear and must be calibrated periodically against more precise laboratory gage blocks.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 157004, "end_char_idx": 161655, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "230137fd-8b40-4c66-a3b3-81bcd432c3c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "230137fd-8b40-4c66-a3b3-81bcd432c3c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13591c5b-ad4d-448c-8f97-c17f32572240", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "44ec8f31cc4dc602b93b255af38b02fa5182304b41a8db86e47e56d46d9cb0e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "49c1475e-b361-4f40-85e9-f81684fa6bb1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "a0666b9c4cdc4dca36ef90caf7ad9c41c46a1dbf35f2644492084c9e0d10856d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6953f887-2378-41f5-85fb-4ebad47eccb3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "57e6850c8f5adb665676ee60654ea29aa825513ea5aef8ba34239de9bad7b5a4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A surface plate is a large solid block whose top surface is finished to a flat plane.

Graduated measuring devices include a set of markings (called graduations) on a linear or angular scale to which the object\u2019s feature of interest can be compared for measurement. Nongraduated measuring devices possess no such scale and are used to make comparisons between dimensions or to transfer a dimension for measurement by a graduated device. \rThe most basic of the graduated measuring devices is the rule (made of steel, and often called a steel rule), used to measure linear dimensions. Rules are available in various lengths. Metric rule lengths include 150, 300, 600, and 1000 mm, with graduations of 1 or 0.5 mm. Common U.S. sizes are 6, 12, and 24 in, with graduations of 1/32, 1/64, or 1/100 in. \rCalipers are available in either nongraduated or graduated styles. A nongraduated caliper (referred to simply as a caliper) consists of two legs joined by a hinge mechanism, as in Figure 5.2. The ends of the legs are made to contact the surfaces of the object being measured, and the hinge is designed to hold the legs in position during use. The contacts point either inward or outward. When they point inward, as in Figure 5.2, the instrument is an outside caliper and is used for measuring outside dimensions such as a diameter. When the contacts point outward, it is an inside caliper, which is used to measure the distance between two internal surfaces. An instrument similar in configuration to the caliper is a divider, except that both legs are straight and terminate in hard, sharply pointed contacts. Dividers are used for scaling distances between two points or lines on a surface, and for scribing circles or arcs onto a surface. \r\rFIGURE 5.2 Two sizes of outside calipers.(Courtesy of L. S.Starrett Co.) \r\r\rL. S. Starrett Co.) \rdimension of interest. Slide calipers permit more accurate and precise measurements than simple rules. A refinement of the slide caliper is the vernier caliper,shown in Figure \r5.4. In this device, the movable jaw includes a vernier scale, named after P. Vernier (1580\u20131637), a French mathematician who invented it. The vernier provides graduations of 0.01 mm in the SI (and 0.001 inch in the U.S. customary scale), much more precise than the slide caliper. \rThe micrometer is a widely used and very accurate measuring device, the most common form of which consists of a spindle and a C-shaped anvil, as in Figure 5.5. The spindle is moved relative to the fixed anvil by means of an accurate screw thread. On a typical U.S. micrometer, each rotation of the spindle provides 0.025 in of linear travel. Attached to the spindle is a thimble graduated with 25 marks around its circumference, \r\rL. S. Starrett Co.) \reach mark corresponding to 0.001 in. The micrometer sleeve is usually equipped with a vernier, allowing resolutions as close as 0.0001 in. On a micrometer with metric scale, graduations are 0.01 mm.

They are usually not capable of providing an absolute measurement of the quantity of interest; instead, they measure the magnitude and direction of the deviation between two objects. Instruments in this category include mechanical and electronic gages. \rMechanical Gages: Dial Indicators Mechanical gages are designed to mechanically magnify the deviation to permit observation. The most common instrument in this category is the dial indicator, Figure 5.6, which converts and amplifies the linear movement of a contact pointer into rotation of a dial needle.The dial is graduated in \r\rFIGURE 5.7 Dial indicator setup to measurerunout; as part is rotatedabout its center, variations in outside surface relative to center are indicated on the dial. \r\rsmall units such as 0.01 mm (or 0.001 in). Dial indicators are used in many applications to measure straightness, flatness, parallelism, squareness, roundness, and run-out. A typical setup for measuring run-out is illustrated in Figure 5.7. \rElectronic Gages Electronic gages are a family of measuring and gaging instruments based on transducers capable of converting a linear displacement into an electrical signal. The electrical signal is then amplified and transformed into a suitable data format such as a digital readout, as in Figure 5.5. Applications of electronic gages have grown rapidly in recent years, driven by advances in microprocessor technology. They are gradually replacing many of the conventional measuring and gaging devices. Advantages of electronic gages include (1) good sensitivity, accuracy, precision, repeatability, and speed of response; (2) ability to sense very small dimensions\u2014down to 0.025 mm (1 m-in.); (3) ease of operation; (4) reduced human error; \r(5) electrical signal that can be displayed in various formats; and (6) capabil-ity to be interfaced with computer systems for data processing. \r5.2.4 FIXED GAGES \rA fixed gage is a physical replica of the part dimension to be assessed. There are two basic categories: master gage and limit gage. A master gage is fabricated to be a direct replica of the nominal size of the part dimension. It is generally used for setting up a comparative measuring instrument, such as a dial indicator; or for calibrating a measuring device. \rA limit gage is fabricated to be a reverse replica of the part dimension and is designed to check the dimension at one or more of its tolerance limits. A limit gage often consists of two gages in one piece, the first for checking the lower limit of the tolerance on the part dimension, and the other for checking the upper limit. These gages are popularly known as GO/NO-GO gages, because one gage limit allows the part to be inserted, whereas the other limit does not.

A limit gage often consists of two gages in one piece, the first for checking the lower limit of the tolerance on the part dimension, and the other for checking the upper limit. These gages are popularly known as GO/NO-GO gages, because one gage limit allows the part to be inserted, whereas the other limit does not. The GO limit is used to check the dimension at its maximum material condition; this is the minimum size for an internal feature such as a hole, and it is the maximum size for an external fea-ture such as an outside diameter. The NO-GO limit is used to inspect the minimum material condition of the dimension in question. \rCommon limit gages are snap gages and ring gages for checking outside part \rdimensions, and plug gages for checking inside dimensions. A snap gage consists \rof a C-shaped frame with gaging surfaces located in the jaws of the frame, as in Figure 5.8. It has two gage buttons, the first being the GO gage, and the second being the NO-GO gage. Snap gages are used for checking outside dimensions such as diameter, width, thickness, and similar surfaces. \rRing gages are used for checking cylindrical diameters. For a given application, a pair of gages is usually required, one GO and the other NO-GO. Each gage is a ring whose opening is machined to one of the tolerance limits of the part diameter. For ease of handling, the outside of the ring is knurled. The two gages are distinguished by the presence of a groove around the outside of the NO-GO ring. \rThe most common limit gage for checking hole diameter is the plug gage. The typical gage consists of a handle to which are attached two accurately ground cylindrical pieces (plugs) of hardened steel, as in Figure 5.9. The cylindrical plugs serve as the GO and NO-GO gages. Other gages similar to the plug gage include taper gages, consisting of a tapered plug for checking tapered holes; and thread gages, in which the plug is threaded for checking internal threads on parts. \rA wear allowance is usually added to the GO limit (maximum material condition) of fixed gages, especially ones that are used frequently. This allowance is expected to account for gradual wearing of the gage GO surface against the part surfaces that are being checked. The wear allowance is typically specified as a percent that is applied to the total tolerance band of the part dimension of interest. \r\rExample 5.1 Wear allowance on a fixed gage \rA GO/NO GO plug gage is designed to check a hole diameter that is dimensioned 20.00 mm \u00b1 0.10 mm. A wear allowance of 2.5% of the total tolerance band is applied to the GO side of the gage. Determine the nominal sizes of the GO and NO GO sides of the gage. \rSolution: The total tolerance band = 0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20 mm. The wear allowance = 0.025(0.20) = 0.005 mm. The GO gage is used to check the minimum acceptable hole diameter, which is 20.00 -0.10 = 19.90 mm. Because this is the surface that will wear, the wear allowance is applied to it. Accordingly, the nominal size of the GO gage = 19.90 + 0.005 = 19.905 mm. \rThe NO GO gage is used to check the maximum hole diameter. Because insertion of the gage will occur only in an out-of-tolerance situation, its wear should be negligible.Therefore,the nominal size of the NO GO gage = \r20.00 + 0.10 = 20.10 mm. \r\rin diameters of GO and NO-GO plugs \ris exaggerated. \rFixed gages are easy to use, and the time required to complete an inspection is almost always less than when a measuring instrument is employed.

Their disadvantage is that they provide little if any information on the actual part size; they only indicate whether the size is within tolerance. Today, with the availability of high-speed electronic measuring instruments, and with the need for statistical proc-ess control of part sizes, use of gages is gradually giving way to instruments that provide actual measurements of the dimension of interest. \r5.2.5 ANGULAR MEASUREMENTS \rAngles can be measured using any of several styles of protractor.A simple protractor consists of a blade that pivots relative to a semicircular head that is graduated in angular units (e.g., degrees, radians). To use, the blade is rotated to a position corresponding to some part angle to be measured, and the angle is read off the angular scale. A bevel protractor, Figure 5.10, consists of two straight blades that pivot relative to each other. The pivot assembly has a protractor scale that permits the angle formed by the blades to be read. When equipped with a vernier, the bevel protractor can be read to about 5 min; without a vernier the resolution is only about 1 degree. \r\r\rHigh precision in angular measurements can be made using a sine bar, illustrated in Figure 5.11. One possible setup consists of a flat steel straight edge (the sine bar), and two precision rolls set a known distance apart on the bar. The straight edge is aligned with the part angle to be measured, and gage blocks are used or other accurate linear measurements are made to determine height. The proce-dure is carried out on a surface plate to achieve the most accurate results. This height H and the length L of the sine bar between rolls are used to calculate the angle A using \rH\rsin A = (5.2) \rL \rExample 5.2 A sine bar that is 200.00 mm long is used to measure the angle on a part in a setup similar to that in Figure 5.11. Gage blocks are stacked to a height of \rSine bar \r40.380 mm.

The designer specifies the part dimensions, relating the various surfaces to each other. These nominal surfaces, representing the intended surface contour of the part, are defined by lines in the engineering drawing. The nominal surfaces appear as absolutely straight lines, ideal circles, round holes, and other edges and surfaces that are geometrically perfect. The actual surfaces of a manufactured part are deter-mined by the processes used to make it. The variety of processes available in manu-facturing result in wide variations in surface characteristics, and it is important for engineers to understand the technology of surfaces. \rSurfaces are commercially and technologically important for a number of reasons, different reasons for different applications: (1) Aesthetic reasons\u2014surfaces that are smooth and free of scratches and blemishes are more likely to give a favorable impression to the customer.

The first three topics are covered in this section, and the final topic is presented in Section 5.5. \r5.3.1 CHARACTERISTICS OF SURFACES \rA microscopic view of a part\u2019s surface reveals its irregularities and imperfections. The features of a typical surface are illustrated in the highly magnified cross section of the surface of a metal part in Figure 5.12. Although the discussion here is focused on metallic surfaces, these comments apply to ceramics and polymers, with modifications owing to differences in structure of these materials. The bulk of the part, referred to as the substrate, has a grain structure that depends on previous processing of the metal; for example, the metal\u2019s substrate structure is affected by its chemical composition, the casting process originally used on the metal, and any deformation operations and heat treatments performed on the casting. \rThe exterior of the part is a surface whose topography is anything but straight and smooth. In this highly magnified cross section, the surface has roughness, waviness, and flaws. Although not shown here, it also possesses a pattern and/or direction resulting from the mechanical process that produced it. All of these geometric features are included in the term surface texture. \rJust below the surface is a layer of metal whose structure differs from that of the substrate. This is called the altered layer, and it is a manifestation of the actions that have been visited upon the surface during its creation and after-ward. Manufacturing processes involve energy, usually in large amounts, which operates on the part against its surface. The altered layer may result from work hardening (mechanical energy), heating (thermal energy), chemical treatment, or even electrical energy. The metal in this layer is affected by the application \r\rof energy, and its microstructure is altered accordingly. This altered layer falls within the scope of surface integrity, which is concerned with the definition, specification, and control of the surface layers of a material (most commonly metals) in manufacturing and subsequent performance in service. The scope of surface integrity is usually interpreted to include surface texture as well as the altered layer beneath. \rIn addition, most metal surfaces are coated with an oxide film, given sufficient time after processing for the film to form. Aluminum forms a hard, dense, thin film of Al2O3 on its surface (which serves to protect the substrate from corrosion), and iron forms oxides of several chemistries on its surface (rust, which provides virtually no protection at all). There is also likely to be moisture, dirt, oil, adsorbed gases, and other contaminants on the part\u2019s surface. \r5.3.2 SURFACE TEXTURE \rSurface texture consists of the repetitive and/or random deviations from the nomi-nal surface of an object; it is defined by four features: roughness, waviness, lay, and flaws, shown in Figure 5.13. Roughness refers to the small, finely spaced deviations from the nominal surface that are determined by the material characteristics and the process that formed the surface. Waviness is defined as the deviations of much larger spacing; they occur because of work deflection, vibration, heat treatment, and similar factors. Roughness is superimposed on waviness. Lay is the predominant direction or pattern of the surface texture. It is determined by the manufacturing method used to create the surface, usually from the action of a cutting tool.

Finally, flaws are irregularities that occur occasionally on the sur-face; these include cracks, scratches, inclusions, and similar defects in the surface. Although some of the flaws relate to surface texture, they also affect surface integrity (Section 5.3.3). \r\r\rSurface Roughness and Surface Finish Surface roughness is a measurable characteristic based on the roughness deviations as defined above. Surface finish is a more subjective term denoting smoothness and general quality of a surface. In popular usage, surface finish is often used as a synonym for surface roughness. \rThe most commonly used measure of surface texture is surface roughness. With respect to Figure 5.15, surface roughness can be defined as the average of the vertical deviations from the nominal surface over a specified surface length. An arithmetic average (AA) is generally used, based on the absolute values of the deviations, and this roughness value is referred to by the name average roughness. In equation form, \rLm |y|\rRa =J dx (5.1) 0 Lm \rwhere Ra = arithmetic mean value of roughness, m (in); y = the vertical deviation from nominal surface (converted to absolute value), m (in); and Lm = the specified distance over which the surface deviations are measured. An approximation of Equation (5.1), perhaps easier to comprehend, is given by \rn \r|yi|Ra = (5.2) \rz \ri=1 n \rFIGURE 5.15 \rDeviations from nominal surface used in the two definitions of surface roughness. \r\rwhere Ra has the same meaning as above; yi = vertical deviations converted to absolute value and identified by the subscript i, m (in); and n = the number of deviations included in Lm. The units in these equations are meters and inches. In fact, the scale of the deviations is very small, so more appropriate units are mm(mm = m X 10-6 = mm X 10-3) or m-in (m-in = inch X 10-6). These are the units commonly used to express surface roughness. \rThe AA method is the most widely used averaging method for surface roughness today. An alternative, sometimes used in the United States, is the root-mean-square (RMS) average, which is the square root of the mean of the squared deviations over the measuring length. RMS surface roughness values will almost always be greater than the AA values because the larger deviations will figure more prominently in the calculation of the RMS value. \rSurface roughness suffers the same kinds of deficiencies of any single measure used to assess a complex physical attribute. For example, it fails to account for the lay of the surface pattern; thus, surface roughness may vary significantly, depending on the direction in which it is measured. \rAnother deficiency is that waviness can be included in the Ra computation. To deal with this problem, a parameter called the cutoff length is used as a filter that separates the waviness in a measured surface from the roughness deviations. In effect, the cutoff length is a sampling distance along the surface. A sampling distance shorter than the waviness width will eliminate the vertical deviations associated with waviness and only include those associated with roughness.

To deal with this problem, a parameter called the cutoff length is used as a filter that separates the waviness in a measured surface from the roughness deviations. In effect, the cutoff length is a sampling distance along the surface. A sampling distance shorter than the waviness width will eliminate the vertical deviations associated with waviness and only include those associated with roughness. The most common cutoff length used in practice is 0.8 mm (0.030 in). The measuring length Lm is normally set at about five times the cutoff length. \rThe limitations of surface roughness have motivated the development of additional measures that more completely describe the topography of a given surface. These measures include three-dimensional graphical renderings of the surface, as described in [17]. \rSymbols for Surface Texture Designers specify surface texture on an engineering drawing by means of symbols as in Figure 5.16. The symbol designating surface texture parameters is a check mark (looks like a square root sign), with entries as indicated for average roughness, waviness, cutoff, lay, and maximum roughness spacing. The symbols for lay are from Figure 5.14. \r\r5.3.3 SURFACE INTEGRITY \rSurface texture alone does not completely describe a surface. There may be metallurgical or other changes in the material immediately beneath the surface that can have a significant effect on its mechanical properties. Surface integrity is the study and control of this subsurface layer and any changes in it as a result of processing that may influence the performance of the finished part or product. This subsurface layer was previously referred to as the altered layer when its structure differs from the substrate, as in Figure 5.12. \rThe possible alterations and injuries to the subsurface layer that can occur in manufacturing are listed in Table 5.2. The surface changes are caused by the application of various forms of energy during processing\u2014mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electrical. Mechanical energy is the most common form used in manufacturing; it is applied against the work material in operations such as metal forming (e.g., forging, extrusion), pressworking, and machining. Although its primary function in these processes is to change the geometry of the work part, mechanical energy can also cause residual stresses, work hardening, and cracks in the surface layers. Table 5.3 indicates \rTABLE \u2022 5.2 Surface and subsurface alterations that define surface integrity.a \rAbsorption are impurities that are absorbed and retained in surface layers of the base material,possibly leading to embrittlement or other property changes. \rAlloy depletion occurs when critical alloyingelements are lost from the surface layers, withpossible loss of properties in the metal. \rCracks are narrow ruptures or separations either at or below the surface that alter the continuityof the material. Cracks are characterized by sharpedges and length-to-width ratios of 4:1 or more.They are classified as macroscopic (can be observed with magnification of 10X or less) and microscopic (requires magnification of more than 10X). \rCraters are rough surface depressions left in the surface by short circuit discharges; associated withelectrical processing methods such as electric discharge machining and electrochemical machining(Chapter 25). \rHardness changes refer to hardness differences at \ror near the surface.

Most of the alterations in the table refer to metals, for which surface integrity has been most intensively studied. \rMeasurement of Surfaces \r5.4 \rSurfaces are described as consisting of two parameters: (1) surface texture and \r(2) surface integrity. This section is concerned with the measurement of these two parameters. \r5.4.1 MEASUREMENT OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS \rVarious methods are used to assess surface roughness. They can be divided into three categories: (1) subjective comparison with standard test surfaces, (2) stylus electronic instruments, and (3) optical techniques. \rStandard Test Surfaces Sets of standard surface finish blocks are available, produced to specified roughness values. To estimate the roughness of a given test specimen, the surface is compared with the standard both visually and by the \u201cfingernail test.\u201d In this test, the user gently scratches the surfaces of the specimen and the stand-ards, judging which standard is closest to the specimen. Standard test surfaces are a convenient way for a machine operator to obtain an estimate of surface roughness. They are also useful for design engineers in judging what value of surface roughness to specify on a part drawing. \rStylus Instruments The disadvantage of the fingernail test is its subjectivity. Several stylus-type instruments are commercially available to measure surface roughness\u2014similar to the fingernail test, but more scientific. An example is the instrument shown in Figure 5.17 tracing a standard test surface. In these elec-tronic devices, a cone-shaped diamond stylus with point radius of about 0.005 mm (0.0002 in) and 90\u00b0 tip angle is traversed across the test surface at a constant slow speed. The operation is depicted in Figure 5.18. As the stylus head is traversed horizontally, it also moves vertically to follow the surface deviations. The vertical movement is converted into an electronic signal that represents the topography \r\rFIGURE 5.17 Stylus-typeinstrument for measuringsurface roughness traversing a standard test surface.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 185440, "end_char_idx": 189972, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a838e038-f701-429f-99db-b014e9d8708e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a838e038-f701-429f-99db-b014e9d8708e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13591c5b-ad4d-448c-8f97-c17f32572240", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "44ec8f31cc4dc602b93b255af38b02fa5182304b41a8db86e47e56d46d9cb0e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b3e429b8-8255-4e6a-923d-13f0af65b83e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "0628360b0ea41b8c7ed1d59b5d8b016363b6f0e1b06aba7e9330a2a38c0faffd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b7d06d4a-c7a5-44f5-8939-c0bbeee1461f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "16aa9c0776e512a03e29dca3552d3c88153fa111976c908c3e3806f954992cfc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Stylus Instruments The disadvantage of the fingernail test is its subjectivity.

This can be displayed as either a profile of the actual surface or an average roughness value. Profiling devices use a separate flat plane as the nominal reference against which deviations are measured. The output is a plot of the surface contour along the line traversed by the stylus. This type of system can identify both roughness and waviness in the test surface. Averaging devices reduce the roughness deviations to a single value Ra . They use skids riding on the actual sur-face to establish the nominal reference plane. The skids act as a mechanical filter to reduce the effect of waviness in the surface; in effect, these averaging devices electronically perform the computations in Equation (5.1). \rOptical Techniques Most other surface-measuring instruments employ optical techniques to assess roughness. These techniques are based on light reflectance from the surface, light scatter or diffusion, and laser technology. They are useful in applications where stylus contact with the surface is undesirable. Some of the techniques permit very-high-speed operation, thus making 100% inspection feasible. However, the optical techniques yield values that do not always correlate well with roughness measurements made by stylus-type instruments. \r5.4.2 EVALUATION OF SURFACE INTEGRITY \rFIGURE 5.18 Sketch illustrating the operation of stylus-type instrument. Stylus head traverseshorizontally across surface, while stylus moves vertically to followsurface profile. Verticalmovement is converted into either (1) a profileof the surface or (2) theaverage roughness value. \rSurface integrity is more difficult to assess than surface roughness. Some of the techniques to inspect for subsurface changes are destructive to the material specimen. Evaluation techniques for surface integrity include the following: \r\r\r\rProcess Typical Tolerance, mm (in) \r\u27a2 \rSurface texture. Surface roughness, designation of lay, and other measures pro-vide superficial data on surface integrity. This type of testing is relatively simple to perform and is always included in the evaluation of surface integrity. \r\r\u27a2 \rVisual examination. Visual examination can reveal various surface flaws such as cracks, craters, laps, and seams. This type of assessment is often augmented by fluorescent and photographic techniques. \r\r\u27a2 \rMicrostructural examination. This involves standard metallographic techniques for preparing cross sections and obtaining photomicrographs for examination of microstructure in the surface layers compared with the substrate. \r\r\u27a2 \rMicrohardness profile. Hardness differences near the surface can be detected using microhardness measurement techniques such as Knoop and Vickers (Section 3.2.1). The part is sectioned, and hardness is plotted against distance below the surface to obtain a hardness profile of the cross section. \r\r\u27a2 \rResidual stress profile.

Metals are the most important engineering materials and the topic of this chapter. A metal is a category of materials generally characterized by properties of ductility, malleability, luster, and high electrical and thermal conductivity. The category includes both metallic elements and their alloys. Metals have properties that satisfy a wide variety of design requirements. The manufacturing processes by which they are shaped into products have been developed and refined over many years; indeed, some of the processes date from ancient times (Historical Note 1.2). In addition, the properties of metals can be enhanced through heat treatment, covered in Chapter 26. \rThe technological and commercial importance of metals derives from the following general properties possessed by virtually all of the common metals: \r\u27a2 \rHigh stiffness and strength. Metals can be alloyed for high rigidity, strength, and hardness; thus, they are used to provide the structural framework for most engineered products. \r\r\u27a2 \rToughness. Metals have the capacity to absorb energy better than other classes of materials. \r\r\u27a2 \rGood electrical conductivity. Metals are conductors because of their metallic bonding that permits the free movement of electrons as charge carriers. \r\r\u27a2 \rGood thermal conductivity. Metallic bonding also explains why metals generally conduct heat better than ceramics or polymers. \r\r\r\rIn addition, certain metals have specific properties that make them attractive for specialized applications. Many common metals are available at relatively low cost per unit weight and are often the material of choice simply because of their low cost. \rMetals are converted into parts and products using a variety of manufacturing processes. The starting form of the metal differs, depending on the process. The major categories are (1) cast metal, in which the initial form is a casting; (2) wrought metal, in which the metal has been worked or can be worked (e.g., rolled or otherwise formed) after casting; better mechanical properties are generally associated with wrought metals compared with cast metals; and (3) powdered metal, in which the metal is purchased in the form of very small powders for conversion into parts using powder metallurgy techniques. Most metals are available in all three forms. The discussion in this chapter focuses on categories (1) and (2), which are of greatest commercial and engineering interest. Powder metallurgy techniques are examined in Chapter 15. \rMetals are classified into two major groups: (1) ferrous\u2014those based on iron; and (2) nonferrous\u2014all other metals. The ferrous group can be further subdivided into steels and cast irons.

The ferrous group can be further subdivided into steels and cast irons. Most of the discussion in the present chapter is organized around this classification, but first the general topic of alloys and phase diagrams is introduced. \r\rAlloys and Phase Diagrams \rAlthough some metals are important as pure elements (e.g., gold, silver, copper), most engineering applications require the improved properties obtained by alloying. Through alloying, it is possible to enhance strength, hardness, and other properties compared with pure metals. This section defines and classifies alloys; it then discusses phase diagrams which indicate the phases of an alloy system as a function of compo-sition and temperature. \r6.1.1 ALLOYS \rAn alloy is a metal composed of two or more elements, at least one of which is metal-lic. The two main categories of alloys are (1) solid solutions and (2) intermediate phases. \rSolid Solutions A solid solution is an alloy in which one element is dissolved in another to form a single-phase structure. The term phase describes any homogeneous mass of material, such as a metal in which the grains all have the same crystal lattice structure. In a solid solution, the solvent or base element is metallic, and the dissolved element can be either metallic or nonmetallic. Solid solutions come in two forms, shown in Figure 6.1. The first is a substitutional solid solution, in which atoms of the solvent element are replaced in its unit cell by the dissolved element. Brass is an example, in which zinc is dissolved in copper. To make the substitution, several rules must be satisfied ([3], [6], [7]): (1) the atomic radii of the two elements must be simi-lar, usually within 15%; (2) their lattice types must be the same; (3) if the elements have different valences, the lower valence metal is more likely to be the solvent; and \r(4) if the elements have high chemical affinity for each other, they are less likely to form a solid solution and more likely to form a compound. \r\r(a) \rsubstitutional solid solution, and \r\r(b) \rinterstitial solid solution. (a) (b) \r\r\rThe second type of solid solution is an interstitial solid solution, in which atoms of the dissolving element fit into the vacant spaces between base metal atoms in the lattice structure. It follows that the atoms fitting into these interstices must be small compared with those of the solvent metal. The most important example of this second type is carbon dissolved in iron to form steel. \rIn both forms of solid solution, the alloy structure is generally stronger and harder than either of the component elements. \rIntermediate Phases There are usually limits to the solubility of one element in another. When the amount of the dissolving element in the alloy exceeds the solid solubility limit of the base metal, a second phase forms in the alloy. The term intermediate phase is used to describe it because its chemical composition is intermediate between the two pure elements. Its crystalline structure is also different from those of the pure metals. Depending on composition, and recognizing that many alloys consist of more than two elements, these intermediate phases can be of several types, including (1) metallic compounds consisting of a metal and nonmetal such as Fe3C; and (2) intermetallic compounds\u2014two metals that form a compound, such as Mg2Pb. The composition of the alloy is often such that the intermediate phase is mixed with the primary solid solution to form a two-phase structure, one phase dispersed throughout the second. These two-phase alloys are important because they can be formulated and heat-treated for significantly higher strength than solid solutions. \r6.1.2 PHASE DIAGRAMS \rAs the term is used in this text, a phase diagram is a graphical means of representing the phases of a metal alloy system as a function of composition and temperature. Discussion of the diagram will be limited to alloy systems consisting of two elements at atmospheric pressures. This type of diagram is called a binary phase diagram. Other forms of phase diagrams are discussed in texts on materials science, such as [6]. \rThe Copper\u2013Nickel Alloy System The best way to introduce the phase diagram is by example.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 199187, "end_char_idx": 203744, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce13d2f6-5b12-416d-916a-fa5ef7ce6221": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce13d2f6-5b12-416d-916a-fa5ef7ce6221", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13591c5b-ad4d-448c-8f97-c17f32572240", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "44ec8f31cc4dc602b93b255af38b02fa5182304b41a8db86e47e56d46d9cb0e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3fdbe5d3-3539-42d8-a690-abdeb99f91a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec12456.txt", "file_name": "Sec12456.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 221266, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "e31b281d34f99064399c54b98ccfa7db97eef4615010a02e6162d81cbb0bf02b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "291f778e-1a76-4345-858b-feaff5578fa8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5de4d65b603596f189f788f25495de7c78cbae7e9130a58dddf99a13d42c93a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The composition of the alloy is often such that the intermediate phase is mixed with the primary solid solution to form a two-phase structure, one phase dispersed throughout the second.

Discussion of the diagram will be limited to alloy systems consisting of two elements at atmospheric pressures. This type of diagram is called a binary phase diagram. Other forms of phase diagrams are discussed in texts on materials science, such as [6]. \rThe Copper\u2013Nickel Alloy System The best way to introduce the phase diagram is by example. Figure 6.2 presents one of the simplest cases, the Cu\u2013Ni alloy system. Composition is plotted on the horizontal axis and temperature on the vertical axis. Thus, any point in the diagram indicates the overall composition and the phase or phases present at the given temperature. Pure copper melts at 1083\u00b0C (1981\u00b0F), and pure nickel at 1455\u00b0C (2651\u00b0F). Alloy compositions between these extremes exhibit gradual melting that commences at the solidus and concludes at the liquidus as temperature is increased. \rThe copper\u2013nickel system is a solid solution alloy throughout its entire range of compositions. Anywhere in the region below the solidus line, the alloy is a solid \r\r0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90100 Cu Ni\r% Nickel (Ni) \rsolution; there are no intermediate solid phases in this system. However, there is a mixture of phases in the region bounded by the solidus and liquidus. Recall from Section 4.1.3 that the solidus is the temperature at which the solid metal begins to melt as temperature is increased, and the liquidus is the temperature at which melting is completed. It can now be seen in the phase diagram that these temperatures vary with composition. Between the solidus and liquidus, the metal is a solid\u2013liquid mix. \rDetermining Chemical Compositions of Phases Although the overall composition of the alloy is given by its position along the horizontal axis, the compositions of the liquid and solid phases are not the same. It is possible to determine these compositions from the phase diagram by drawing a horizontal line at the temperature of interest. The points of intersection between the horizontal line and the solidus and liquidus indicate the compositions of the solid and liquid phases present, respectively. Simply construct the vertical projections from the intersection points to the x-axis and read the corresponding compositions. \rExample 6.1 Determining compositions from the phase diagram \rAnalyze the compositions of the liquid and solid phases present in the copper-nickel system at an aggregate composition of 50% nickel and a temperature of 1260\u00b0C (2300\u00b0F). \rSolution: A horizontal line is drawn at the given temperature level as shown in Figure 6.2.The line intersects the solidus at a composition of 62% nickel, thus indicating the composition of the solid phase.The intersection with the liquidus occurs at a composition of 36% Ni, corresponding to the analysis of the liquid phase. \rAs the temperature of the 50\u201350 Cu\u2013Ni alloy is reduced, the solidus line is reached at about 1221\u00b0C (2230\u00b0F). Applying the same procedure used in the example, the composition of the solid metal is 50% nickel, and the composition of the last remaining liquid to freeze is about 26% nickel. How is it, the reader might ask, that the last ounce of molten metal has a composition so different from the solid metal into which it freezes? The answer is that the phase diagram assumes equilibrium conditions are allowed to prevail. In fact, the binary phase diagram is sometimes called an equilibrium diagram because of this assumption. What it means is that enough time is permitted for the solid metal to gradually change its composition by diffusion to achieve the composition indicated by the intersection point along the liquidus. In practice, when an alloy freezes (e.g., a casting), segregation occurs in the solid mass because of nonequilibrium conditions.

In fact, the binary phase diagram is sometimes called an equilibrium diagram because of this assumption. What it means is that enough time is permitted for the solid metal to gradually change its composition by diffusion to achieve the composition indicated by the intersection point along the liquidus. In practice, when an alloy freezes (e.g., a casting), segregation occurs in the solid mass because of nonequilibrium conditions. The first liquid to solidify has a composition that is rich in the metal element with the higher melting point. Then as additional metal solidifies, its composition is different from that of the first metal to freeze. As the nucleation sites grow into a solid mass, compositions are distributed within the mass, depending on the temperature and time in the process at which freezing occurred. The overall composition is the average of the distribution. \rDetermining Amounts of Each Phase The amounts of each phase present at a given temperature can also be determined from the phase diagram. This is done by the inverse lever rule: (1) using the same horizontal line as before that indicates the overall composition at a given temperature, measure the distances between the aggregate composition and the intersection points with the liquidus and solidus, identifying the distances as CL and CS, respectively (refer back to Figure 6.2); \r(2) the proportion of liquid phase present is given by  \rCSL phase proportion = (CS + CL)  (6.1)  \r(3) the proportion of solid phase present is given by  \rCLS phase proportion = (CS + CL)  (6.2)  \r\rExample 6.2 Determining proportions of each phase \rDetermine the proportions of liquid and solid phases for the 50% nickel composition of the copper\u2013nickel system at the temperature of 1260\u00b0C (2300\u00b0F). \rSolution: Using the same horizontal line in Figure 6.2 as in previous Example 6.1, the distances CS and CL are measured as 10 mm and 12 mm, respectively. Thus the proportion of the liquid phase is 10/22 = 0.45 (45%), and the proportion of solid phase is 12/22 = 0.55 (55%). \rThe proportions given by Eqs. (6.1) and (6.2) are by weight, same as the phase diagram percentages. Note that the proportions are based on the distance on the opposite side of the phase of interest; hence the name inverse lever rule. One can see the logic in this by taking the extreme case when, say, CS = 0; at that point, the proportion of the liquid phase is zero because the solidus has been reached and the alloy is therefore completely solidified. \rThe methods for determining chemical compositions of phases and the amounts of each phase are applicable to the solid region of the phase diagram as well as the liquidus\u2013solidus region. Wherever there are regions in the phase diagram in which two phases are present, these methods can be used. When only one phase is present (in Figure 6.2, this is the entire solid region), the composition of the phase is its aggregate composition under equilibrium conditions; and the inverse lever rule does not apply because there is only one phase. \rThe Tin\u2013Lead Alloy System A more complicated phase diagram is the Sn\u2013Pb system, shown in Figure 6.3. Tin\u2013lead alloys have traditionally been used as solders for making electrical and mechanical connections (Section 30.2).1 The phase diagram exhibits several features not included in the previous Cu\u2013Ni system. One feature is the presence of two solid phases, alpha (a) and beta (b). The a phase is a solid solution of tin in lead at the left side of the diagram, and the b phase is a solid solution of lead in tin that occurs only at elevated temperatures around 200\u00b0C (375\u00b0F) at the right side of the diagram. Between these solid solutions lies a mixture of the two solid phases, a + b. \rAnother feature of interest in the tin\u2013lead system is how melting differs for different compositions. Pure tin melts at 232\u00b0C (449\u00b0F), and pure lead melts at 327\u00b0C (621\u00b0F). Alloys of these elements melt at lower temperatures. The diagram shows two liquidus lines that begin at the melting points of the pure metals and meet at a composition of 61.9% Sn. This is the eutectic composition for the tin\u2013lead system.

Typical applications: Construction, machinery, automotive, railway tracks and equipment. \rCompiled from [6], [11], [12], and other references. \rMethods for determining the chemical analysis of the phases and the proportions of phases present can be readily applied to the Sn\u2013Pb system just as it was used in the Cu\u2013Ni system. In fact, these methods are applicable in any region containing two phases, including two solid phases. Most alloy systems are characterized by the existence of multiple solid phases and eutectic compositions, and so the phase diagrams of these systems are often similar to the tin\u2013lead diagram. Of course, many alloy systems are considerably more complex, for example, the iron-carbon system, considered next. \r\rFerrous Metals \rThe ferrous metals are based on iron, one of the oldest metals known to humans (Historical Note 6.1). The properties and other data relating to iron are listed in Table 6.1(a). The ferrous metals of engineering importance are alloys of iron and carbon. These alloys divide into two major groups: steel and cast iron. Together, they constitute approximately 85% of the metal tonnage in the United States [6]. The discussion of ferrous metals begins with the iron\u2013carbon phase diagram. \r\r\r6.2.1 THE IRON\u2013CARBON PHASE DIAGRAM \rThe iron\u2013carbon phase diagram is shown in Figure 6.4. Pure iron melts at 1539\u00b0C (2802\u00b0F). During the rise in temperature from ambient, it undergoes several solid phase transformations as indicated in the diagram. Starting at room temperature the phase is alpha (a), also called ferrite. At 912\u00b0C (1674\u00b0F), ferrite transforms to gamma (g), called austenite. This, in turn, transforms at 1394\u00b0C (2541\u00b0F) to delta (d), which remains until melting occurs. The three phases are distinct; alpha and delta have BCC lattice structures (Section 2.3.1), and between them, gamma is FCC. \r\r\r6 system, up to about 6% Fe C carbon. % Carbon (C) \rIron as a commercial product is available at various levels of purity.

Electrolytic iron is the most pure, at about 99.99%, for research and other purposes where the pure metal is required. Ingot iron, containing about 0.1% impurities (including about 0.01% carbon), is used in applications in which high ductility or corrosion resistance are needed. Wrought iron contains about 3% slag but very little carbon, and is easily shaped in hot forming operations such as forging. \rSolubility limits of carbon in iron are low in the ferrite phase\u2014only about 0.022% at 723\u00b0C (1333\u00b0F). Austenite can dissolve up to about 2.1% carbon at a temperature of 1130\u00b0C (2066\u00b0F). This difference in solubility between alpha and gamma leads to opportunities for strengthening by heat treatment, but leave that for Chapter 26. Even without heat treatment, the strength of iron increases dramatically as carbon content increases, and the metal is called steel. More precisely, steel is defined as an iron\u2013carbon alloy containing from 0.02% to 2.11% carbon.2 Of course, steels can also contain other alloying elements as well. \rThe diagram indicates a eutectic composition at 4.3% carbon. There is a similar feature in the solid region of the diagram at 0.77% carbon and 723\u00b0C (1333\u00b0F). This is called the eutectoid composition. Steels below this carbon level are known as hypoeutectoid steels, and above this carbon level, from 0.77% to 2.1%, they are called hypereutectoid steels. \rIn addition to the phases mentioned, one other phase is prominent in the iron\u2013 carbon alloy system. This is Fe3C, also known as cementite, an intermediate phase. It is a metallic compound of iron and carbon that is hard and brittle. At room temperature under equilibrium conditions, iron\u2013carbon alloys form a two-phase system at carbon levels even slightly above zero. The carbon content in steel ranges between these very low levels and about 2.1% C. Above 2.1% C, up to about 4% or 5%, the alloy is defined as cast iron. \r6.2.2 IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTION \rCoverage of iron and steel production begins with the iron ores and other raw materials required. Iron-making is then discussed, in which iron is reduced from the ores, and steelmaking, in which the iron is refined to obtain the desired purity and composition (alloying) of steel. The casting processes accomplished at the steel mill are then considered. \rIron Ores and Other Raw Materials The principal ore used in the production of iron and steel is hematite (Fe2O3). Other iron ores include magnetite (Fe3O4), siderite (FeCO3), and limonite (Fe2O3-xH2O, in which x is typically around 1.5). Iron ores contain from 50% to around 70% iron, depending on grade (hematite is almost 70% iron). In addition, scrap iron and steel are widely used today as raw materials in iron-and steelmaking. \rOther raw materials needed to reduce iron from the ores are coke and limestone. Coke is a high carbon fuel produced by heating bituminous coal in a limited oxygen atmosphere for several hours, followed by water spraying in special quenching towers. Coke serves two functions in the reduction process: (1) it is a fuel that \r2 This is the conventional definition of steel, but exceptions exist.

Limestone is a rock containing high proportions of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The limestone is used in the process as a flux to react with and remove impurities in the molten iron as slag. \rIron-making To produce iron, a charge of ore, coke, and limestone are dropped into the top of a blast furnace. A blast furnace is a refractory-lined chamber with a diameter of about 9 to 11 m (30\u201335 ft) at its widest and a height of 40 m (125 ft), in which hot gases are forced into the lower part of the chamber at high rates to accom-plish combustion and reduction of the iron. A typical blast furnace and some of its technical details are illustrated in Figures 6.5 and 6.6. The charge slowly descends from the top of the furnace toward the base and is heated to temperatures around 1650\u00b0C (3000\u00b0F). Burning of the coke is accomplished by the hot gases (CO, H2, CO2, H2O, N2, O2, and fuels) as they pass upward through the layers of charge material.

However, it is of interest to note that ceramic materials are actually more abundant and widely used. Included in this category are clay products (e.g., bricks and pottery), glass, cement, and more modern ceramic materials such as tungsten carbide and cubic boron nitride. This is the class of materials discussed in this chapter. Several elements related to ceramics are also covered because they are sometimes used in similar applications. These elements are carbon, silicon, and boron. \rThe importance of ceramics as engineering materi-als derives from their abundance in nature and their mechanical and physical properties, which are quite different from those of metals. A ceramic material is an inorganic compound consisting of a metal (or semi-metal) and one or more nonmetals. The word ceramic traces from the Greek keramos meaning potter\u2019s clay or wares made from fired clay. Important examples of ceramic materials are silica, or silicon dioxide (SiO2), the main ingredient in most glass products; alumina, or aluminum oxide (Al2O3), used in applications rang-ing from abrasives to artificial bones; and more com-plex compounds such as hydrous aluminum silicate (Al2Si2O5(OH)4), known as kaolinite, the principal ingredient in most clay products. The elements in these compounds are the most common in Earth\u2019s crust; see Table 7.1.

In addition to the three basic types, there are glass ceramics\u2014glasses that have been transformed into a largely crystalline structure by heat treatment. \r\r\rStructure and Properties of Ceramics \rCeramic compounds are characterized by covalent and ionic bonding. These bonds are stronger than metallic bonding in metals, which accounts for the high hardness and stiffness but low ductility of ceramic materials. Just as the presence of free electrons in the metallic bond explains why metals are good conductors of heat and electricity, the presence of tightly held electrons in ceramic molecules explains why these materials are poor conductors. The strong bonding also provides these materials with high melting temperatures, although some ceramics decompose, rather than melt, at elevated temperatures. \r\rMost ceramics take a crystalline structure. The structures are generally more complex than those of most metals. There are several reasons for this. First, ceramic molecules usually consist of atoms that are significantly different in size. Second, the ion charges are often different, as in many of the common ceramics such as SiO2 and Al2O3. Both of these factors tend to force a more complicated physical arrangement of the atoms in the molecule and in the resulting crystal structure. In addition, many ceramic materials consist of more than two elements, such as (Al2Si2O5(OH)4), also leading to further complexity in the molecular structure. Crystalline ceramics can be single crystals or polycrystalline substances. In the more common second form, mechanical and physical properties are affected by grain size; higher strength and toughness are achieved in the finer-grained materials. \rSome ceramic materials tend to assume an amorphous structure or glassy phase, rather than a crystalline form.

Instead, it gradually exhibits fluid properties with increasing temperature. It becomes liquid at around 1400\u00b0C (2500\u00b0F). \r\rfor many of the new ceramics are greater than those of metals (see Tables 3.1, 3.6, and 3.7).

The covalent and ionic bonding types are stronger than metallic bonding. However, metallic bonding has the advantage that it allows for slip, the basic mechanism by which metals deform plastically when subjected to high stresses. Bonding in ceramics is more rigid and does not permit slip under stress. The inability to slip makes it much more difficult for ceramics to absorb stresses. Yet ceramics contain the same imperfections in their crystal structure as metals\u2014vacancies, interstitialcies, displaced atoms, and microscopic cracks. These internal flaws tend to concentrate the stresses, especially when a tensile, bending, or impact loading is involved.

Bonding in ceramics is more rigid and does not permit slip under stress. The inability to slip makes it much more difficult for ceramics to absorb stresses. Yet ceramics contain the same imperfections in their crystal structure as metals\u2014vacancies, interstitialcies, displaced atoms, and microscopic cracks. These internal flaws tend to concentrate the stresses, especially when a tensile, bending, or impact loading is involved. As a result of these factors, ceramics fail by brittle fracture under ap-plied stress much more readily than metals. Their tensile strength and toughness are relatively low. Also, their performance is much less predictable due to the random nature of the imperfections and the influence of processing variations, especially in products made of traditional ceramics. \rThe frailties that limit the tensile strength of ceramic materials are not nearly so operative when compressive stresses are applied. Ceramics are substantially strong-er in compression than in tension. For engineering and structural applications, designers have learned to use ceramic components so that they are loaded in compression rather than tension or bending. \rVarious methods have been developed to strengthen ceramics, nearly all of which have as their fundamental approach the minimization of surface and internal flaws and their effects. These methods include [7]: (1) making the starting materials more uniform; (2) decreasing grain size in polycrystalline ceramic products; (3) minimizing porosity; (4) introducing compressive surface stresses; for example, through application of glazes with low thermal expansions, so that the body of the product contracts after firing more than the glaze, thus putting the glaze in compression; (5) using fiber reinforcement; and (6) heat treatments, such as quenching alumina from temperatures in the slightly plastic region to strengthen it. \r\r7.1.2 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES \rSeveral of the physical properties of ceramics are presented in Table 7.2. Most ceramic materials are lighter than metals and heavier than polymers (see Table 4.1). Melting temperatures are higher than for most metals, some ceramics preferring to decompose rather than melt. \rElectrical and thermal conductivities of most ceramics are lower than for metals; but the range of values is greater, permitting some ceramics to be used as insulators while others are electrical conductors. Thermal expansion coefficients are somewhat less than for the metals, but the effects are more damaging in ceramics because of their brittleness. Ceramic materials with relatively high thermal expansions and low thermal conductivities are especially susceptible to failures of this type, which result from significant temperature gradients and associated volumetric changes in differ-ent regions of the same part. The terms thermal shock and thermal cracking are used in connection with such failures. Certain glasses (for example, those containing high proportions of SiO2) and glass ceramics are noted for their low thermal expansion and are particularly resistant to these thermal failures (Pyrex is a familiar example). \r\r\r\r\rTraditional Ceramics \rThese materials are based on mineral silicates, silica, and mineral oxides. The pri-mary products are fired clay (pottery, tableware, brick, and tile), cement, and natural abrasives such as alumina. These products, and the processes used to make them, date back thousands of years (Historical Note 7.1). Glass is also a silicate ceramic material and is often included within the traditional ceramics group [5], [6] Glass is covered in a later section because it is distinguished from the above crystalline materials by its amorphous or vitreous structure (the term vitreous means glassy, or possessing the characteristics of glass). \rHistorical Note 7.1 Ancient pottery ceramics \rMaking pottery has been an art since the earliest civi-The greatest advances in pottery making were lizations.

These solid crystalline compounds have been formed and mixed in the Earth\u2019s crust over billions of years by complex geological processes. The clays are the raw materials used most widely in ceramics. They consist of fine particles of hydrous aluminum silicate that become a plastic substance that is formable and moldable when mixed with water. The most common clays are based on the mineral kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4). Other clay minerals vary in composition, \rboth in terms of proportions of the basic ingredients and through additions of other elements such as magnesium, sodium, and potassium. \rBesides its plasticity when mixed with water, a second characteristic of clay that makes it so useful is that it fuses into a dense, strong material when heated to a sufficiently elevated temperature. The heat treatment is known as firing. Suitable firing temperatures depend on clay composition. Thus, clay can be shaped while wet and soft, and then fired to obtain the final hard ceramic product. \rSilica (SiO2) is another major raw material for the traditional ceramics. It is the principal component in glass, and an important ingredient in other ceramic products including whiteware, refractories, and abrasives. Silica is available naturally in various forms, the most important of which is quartz. The main source of quartz is sandstone. The abundance of sandstone and its relative ease of processing means \r\rthat silica is low in cost; it is also hard and chemically stable. These features account for its widespread use in ceramic products. It is generally mixed in various proportions with clay and other minerals to achieve the appropriate characteristics in the final product. Feldspar is one of the other minerals often used. Feldspar refers to any of several crystalline minerals that consist of aluminum silicate combined with either potassium, sodium, calcium, or barium. The potassium blend, for example, has the chemical composition KAlSi3O8. Mixtures of clay, silica, and feldspar are used to make stoneware, china, and other tableware. \rStill another important raw material for traditional ceramics is alumina. Most alumina is processed from the mineral bauxite, which is an impure mixture of hydrous aluminum oxide and aluminum hydroxide plus similar compounds of iron or manganese. Bauxite is also the principal ore in the production of aluminum metal. A purer but less common form of Al2O3 is the mineral corundum, which contains alumina in massive amounts. Slightly impure forms of corundum crystals are the colored gemstones sapphire and ruby. Alumina ceramic is used as an abrasive in grinding wheels and as a refractory brick in furnaces. \rSilicon carbide, also used as an abrasive, does not occur as a mineral.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 11707, "end_char_idx": 16225, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97dda1f6-5187-4b72-9fb9-abcf531e9655": {"__data__": {"id_": "97dda1f6-5187-4b72-9fb9-abcf531e9655", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec7.txt", "file_name": "Sec7.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47921, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0428f31f-7c60-4660-b08e-bc015d831e14", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec7.txt", "file_name": "Sec7.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47921, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "665d5b04699012d955288fffc4668da3f5ad329c62d06b99d8647fe665ee3ac3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7abfcb98-7f80-4e1c-9219-99c172a7231e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec7.txt", "file_name": "Sec7.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47921, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "b9407e1bda064e3eff84535e39c62ebf98ff79faf0e253c27f3ed77e20cc23b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "189f1a25-8ae2-485c-820d-96e93045dfc7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0e28d3bc0d88338838ae181ad2ae66621ab3a469d09469e5e4337e3208653ed7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Mixtures of clay, silica, and feldspar are used to make stoneware, china, and other tableware. \rStill another important raw material for traditional ceramics is alumina.

The coverage is organized by major categories of traditional ceramic products. A summary of these products, and the raw materials and ceramics out of which they are made, is presented in Table 7.3. The coverage is limited to materials commonly used in manufactured products, thus omitting certain commercially important ceramics such as cement. \rPottery and Tableware This category is one of the oldest, dating back thousands of years; yet it is still one of the most important. It includes tableware products that we all use: earthenware, stoneware, and china. The raw materials for these products are clay usually combined with other minerals such as silica and feldspar. The wetted mixture is shaped and then fired to produce the finished piece. \rEarthenware is the least refined of the group; it includes pottery and similar ar\rticles made in ancient times.

Stoneware has lower porosity than earthenware, resulting from closer control of ingredients and higher firing temperatures. China is fired at even higher temperatures, which produces the translucence in the finished pieces that characterize their fine quality. The reason for this is that much of the ceramic material has been converted to the glassy (vitrified) phase, which is relatively transparent compared to the polycrystalline form. Modern porcelain is nearly the same as china and is produced by firing the components, mainly clay, silica, and feldspar, at still higher temperatures to achieve a very hard, dense, glassy material. Porcelain is used in a variety of products ranging from electrical insulation to bathtub coatings. \rBrick and Tile Building brick, clay pipe, unglazed roof tile, and drain tile are made from various low-cost clays containing silica and gritty matter widely available in natural deposits. These products are shaped by pressing (molding) and firing at rela-tively low temperatures. \rRefractories Refractory ceramics, often in the form of bricks, are critical in many industrial processes that require furnaces and crucibles to heat and/or melt materials. The useful properties of refractory materials are high temperature resistance, thermal insulation, and resistance to chemical reaction with the materials (usually molten metals) being heated.

As mentioned, alumina is often used as a refractory ceramic, together with silica. Other refractory materials include magnesium oxide (MgO) and calcium oxide (CaO). The refractory lining often contains two layers, the outside layer being more porous because this increases the insulation properties. \rAbrasives Traditional ceramics used for abrasive products, such as grinding wheels and sandpaper, are alumina and silicon carbide. Although SiC is the harder mate-rial (hardness of SiC is 2600 HV vs. 2200 HV for alumina), the majority of grinding wheels are based on Al2O3 because it gives better results when grinding steel, the most widely used metal. The abrasive particles (grains of ceramic) are distributed throughout the wheel using a bonding material such as shellac, polymer resin, or rubber. The use of abrasives in industry involves material removal, and the technology of grinding wheels and other abrasive methods to remove material is presented in Chapter 24. \r\r\r\rNew Ceramics \rThe term new ceramics refers to ceramic materials that have been developed synthetically over the last several decades and to improvements in processing techniques that have provided greater control over the structures and properties of ceramic materials. In general, new ceramics are based on compounds other than variations of aluminum silicate (which form the bulk of the traditional ceramic materials). New ceramics are usually simpler chemically than traditional ceramics; for example, oxides, carbides, nitrides, and borides. The dividing line between traditional and new ceramics is sometimes fuzzy, because aluminum oxide and silicon carbide are included among the traditional ceramics. The distinction in these cases is based more on methods of processing than chemical composition. \rThe new ceramics are organized into chemical compound categories: oxides, car\rbides, and nitrides, discussed in the following sections. More complete coverage of \rnew ceramics is presented in references [3], [5], and [8]. \r\r7.3.1 OXIDE CERAMICS \rThe most important oxide new ceramic is alumina. Although also discussed in the context of traditional ceramics, alumina is today produced synthetically from bauxite, using an electric furnace method. Through control of particle size and impurities, refinements in processing methods, and blending with small amounts of other ceramic ingredients, strength and toughness of alumina have been improved substantially compared to its natural counterpart. Alumina also has good hot hardness, low thermal conductivity, and good corrosion resistance. This is a combination of properties that promote a wide variety of applications, including [13]: abrasives (grinding wheel grit), bioceramics (artificial bones and teeth), electrical insulators, electronic components, alloying ingredients in glass, refractory brick, cutting tool inserts (Section 22.3.1), spark plug barrels, and engineering components. Figure 7.1 shows a collection of new ceramic parts, most of which are made of alumina. \r\r7.3.2 CARBIDES \rThe carbide ceramics include silicon carbide (SiC), tungsten carbide (WC), titanium carbide (TiC), tantalum carbide (TaC), and chromium carbide (Cr3C2). Silicon carbide was discussed previously. A part made of SiC is also shown in Figure 7.1. Although it is a man-made ceramic, the methods for its production were developed a century ago, and therefore it is generally included in the traditional ceramics group. In addition to its use as an abrasive, other SiC applications include resistance heating elements and additives in steelmaking. \rFIGURE 7.1 \rA collection of ceramic components.

Tungsten carbide was the first to be developed (Historical Note 7.2) and is the most important and widely used material in the group. WC is typically produced by carburizing tungsten powders that have been reduced from tungsten ores such as wolframite (FeMnWO4) and scheelite (CaWO4). Titanium carbide is produced by carburizing the minerals rutile (TiO2) or ilmenite (FeTiO3). And tantalum carbide is made by carburizing either pure tantalum powders or tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) [11]. Chromium carbide is more suited to applications where chemical stability and oxidation resistance are important. Cr3C2 is prepared by carburizing chromium oxide (Cr2O3) as the starting compound. Carbon black is the usual source of carbon in all of these reactions. \r\rHistorical Note 7.2 Tungsten carbide \rThe compound WC does not occur in nature.

Cemented carbides and other cermets are discussed in Section 9.2. The carbides have little engineering value except as constituents in a composite system. \r\r\r7.3.3 NITRIDES \rThe important nitride ceramics are silicon nitride (Si3N4), boron nitride (BN), and titanium nitride (TiN). As a group, the nitride ceramics are hard and brittle, and they melt at high temperatures (but not generally as high as the carbides). They are usually electrically insulating, except for TiN. \rSilicon nitride shows promise in high temperature structural applications. Si3N4 oxidizes at about 1200\u00b0C (2200\u00b0F) and chemically decomposes at around 1900\u00b0C \r\r\r(3400\u00b0F). It has low thermal expansion, good resistance to thermal shock and creep, and resists corrosion by molten nonferrous metals. These properties have provided applications for this ceramic in gas turbines, rocket engines, and melting crucibles. \rBoron nitride exists in several structures, similar to carbon. The important forms of BN are (1) hexagonal, similar to graphite; and (2) cubic, same as diamond; in fact, its hardness is comparable to that of diamond. This latter structure goes by the names cubic boron nitride and borazon, symbolized cBN, and is produced by heating hexagonal BN under very high pressures. Owing to its extreme hardness, the principal applications of cBN are in cutting tools (Section 22.2.5) and abrasive wheels (Section 24.1.1). Interestingly, it does not compete with diamond cutting tools and grinding wheels. Diamond is suited to nonsteel machining and grinding, while cBN is appropriate for steel. \rTitanium nitride has properties similar to those of other nitrides in this group, ex-cept for its electrical conductivity; it is a conductor. TiN has high hardness, good wear resistance, and a low coefficient of friction with the ferrous metals. This combination of properties makes TiN an ideal material as a surface coating on cutting tools. The coating is only around 0.006 mm (0.0003 in) thick, so the amounts of material used in this application are low. The gold color of titanium nitride makes it suitable for decorative coatings. Finally, its non-toxic properties allow its use in medical applica-tions as a coating material for implants. \rA new ceramic material related to the nitride group, and also to the oxides, is the oxynitride ceramic called sialon. It consists of the elements silicon, aluminum, oxygen, and nitrogen; and its name derives from these ingredients: Si-Al-O-N. Its chemical composition is variable, a typical composition being Si4Al2O2N6. Properties of sialon are similar to those of silicon nitride, but it has better resistance to oxidation at high temperatures than Si3N4. Its principal application is for cutting tools, but its properties may make it suitable for other high temperature applications in the future. \r\r\rGlass \rThe term glass is somewhat confusing because it describes a state of matter as well as a type of ceramic. As a state of matter, the term refers to an amorphous, or noncrystalline, structure of a solid material.

It was performed and the rest of Europe. The art of glassblowing is using an iron tube several feet long, with a mouthpiece still practiced today for certain consumer glassware; on one end and a fixture for holding the molten glass and automated versions of glassblowing are used for on the other. A blob of hot glass in the required initial mass-produced glass products such as bottles and \rshape and viscosity was attached to the end of the iron light bulbs (Chapter 12). \r7.4.1 CHEMISTRY AND PROPERTIES OF GLASS \rThe principal ingredient in virtually all glasses is silica (SiO2), most commonly found as the mineral quartz in sandstone and silica sand. Quartz occurs naturally as a crystalline substance; but when melted and then cooled, it forms vitreous silica. Silica glass has a very low thermal expansion coefficient and is therefore quite resistant to thermal shock. These properties are ideal for elevated temperature applications; accordingly, Pyrex and chemical glassware designed for heating are made with high proportions of silica glass. \rIn order to reduce the melting point of glass for easier processing, and to control properties, the composition of most commercial glasses includes other oxides as well as silica. Silica remains as the main component in these glass products, usually comprising 50% to 75% of total chemistry. The reason SiO2 is used so widely in these compositions is because it is the best glass former. It naturally transforms into a glassy state upon cooling from the liquid, whereas most ceramics crystallize upon solidification. Table 7.4 lists typical chemistries for some common glasses. The additional ingredients are contained in a solid solution with SiO2, and each has a function: (1) acting as flux (promoting fusion) during heating; (2) increasing fluidity in the molten glass for processing; (3) retarding devitrification\u2014the tendency to crystallize from the glassy state; (4) reducing thermal expansion in the final product; \r(5) improving the chemical resistance against attack by acids, basic substances, or water; (6) adding color to the glass; and (7) altering the index of refraction for optical applications (e.g., lenses). \r\r7.4.2 GLASS PRODUCTS \rFollowing is a list of the major categories of glass products.

The roles played by the different ingredients are examined in Table 7.4 as these products are discussed. \rWindow Glass This glass is represented by two chemistries in Table 7.4: (1) soda-lime glass and (2) window glass. The soda-lime formula dates back to the glass-blowing industry of the 1800s and earlier. It was (and is) made by mixing soda (Na2O) and lime (CaO) with silica (SiO2) as the major ingredient.

Modern window glass and the techniques for making it have required slight adjustments in composition and closer control over its variation. Magnesia (MgO) has been added to help re-duce devitrification. \rContainers In previous times, the same basic soda-lime composition was used for manual glass-blowing to make bottles and other containers. Modern processes for shaping glass containers cool the glass more rapidly than older methods. Also, the importance of chemical stability in container glass is better understood today. Resulting changes in composition have attempted to optimize the proportions of lime (CaO) and soda (Na2O3). Lime promotes fluidity. It also increases devitrification, but since cooling is more rapid, this effect is not as important as in prior processing techniques with slower cooling rates. Soda reduces chemical instability and solubil-ity of the container glass. \rLight Bulb Glass Glass used in light bulbs and other thin glass items (e.g., drinking glasses, Christmas ornaments) is high in soda and low in lime; it also contains small amounts of magnesia and alumina. The chemistry is dictated largely by the economics of large volumes involved in light bulb manufacture. The raw materials are inexpensive and suited to the continuous melting furnaces used today. \rLaboratory Glassware These products include containers for chemicals (e.g., flasks, beakers, glass tubing). The glass must be resistant to chemical attack and thermal shock. Glass that is high in silica is suitable because of its low thermal expansion. The trade name \u201cVicor\u201d is used for this high-silica glass. This product is very insoluble in water and acids. Additions of boric oxide also produce a glass with low coefficient of thermal expansion, so some glass for laboratory ware contains B2O3 in amounts of around 13%. The trade name \u201cPyrex\u201d is used for the borosilicate glass developed by the Corning Glass Works. Both Vicor and Pyrex are included in the listing as examples of this product category. \r\rGlass Fibers Glass fibers are manufactured for a number of important applica-tions, including fiberglass reinforced plastics, insulation wool, and fiber optics. The compositions vary according to function. The most commonly used glass reinforcing fibers in plastics are E-glass.

Compositions are indicated in the table. \rInsulating fiberglass wool can be manufactured from regular soda-lime-silica glasses. The glass product for fiber optics consists of a long, continuous core of glass with high refractive index surrounded by a sheath of lower refractive glass. The inside glass must have a very high transmittance for light in order to accomplish long distance communication. \rOptical Glasses Applications for these glasses include lenses for eyeglasses and optical instruments such as cameras, microscopes, and telescopes. To achieve their function, the glasses must have different refractive indices, but each lens must be homogenous in composition. Optical glasses are generally divided into: crowns and flints. Crown glass has a low index of refraction, while flint glass contains lead oxide (PbO) that gives it a high index of refraction. \r\r7.4.3 GLASS-CERAMICS \rGlass-ceramics are a class of ceramic material produced by conversion of glass into a polycrystalline structure through heat treatment. The proportion of crystalline phase in the final product typically ranges between 90% and 98%, with the remain-der being unconverted vitreous material. Grain size is usually between 0.1 and 1.0 mm (4 and 40 m-in), significantly smaller than the grain size of conventional ceramics. This fine crystal microstructure makes glass-ceramics much stronger than the glasses from which they are derived. Also, due to their crystal structure, glass-ceramics are opaque (usually gray or white) rather than clear. \rThe processing sequence for glass-ceramics is as follows: (1) The first step involves heating and forming operations used in glassworking (Section 12.2) to create the desired product geometry. Glass shaping methods are generally more economi-cal than pressing and sintering to shape traditional and new ceramics made from powders. \r(2) The product is cooled. (3) The glass is reheated to a temperature suf-ficient to cause a dense network of crystal nuclei to form throughout the material. It is the high density of nucleation sites that inhibits grain growth of individual crystals, thus leading ultimately to the fine grain size in the glass-ceramic material. The key to the propensity for nucleation is the presence of small amounts of nucleating agents in the glass composition. Common nucleating agents are TiO2, P2O5, and ZrO2. (4) Once nucleation is initiated, the heat treatment is continued at a higher temperature to cause growth of the crystalline phases. \rSeveral examples of glass-ceramic systems and typical compositions are listed in Table 7.5.

These materials are encountered occasionally in subsequent chapters. Although they are not ceramic materials according to the definition, they sometimes compete for applications with ceramics. And they have important applications of their own. Basic data on these elements are presented in Table 7.6. \r7.5.1 CARBON \rCarbon occurs in two alternative forms of engineering and commercial importance: graphite and diamond. They compete with ceramics in various applications: graphite in situations where its refractory properties are important, and diamond \r\rTABLE \u2022 7.6 Some basic data and properties of carbon, silicon, and boron. \r\rCarbon Silicon Boron \rSymbol C Si B Atomic number 6 14 5 Specific gravity 2.25 2.42 2.34 Melting temperature 3727\u00b0Ca (6740\u00b0F) 1410\u00b0C (2570\u00b0F) 2030\u00b0C (3686\u00b0F) Elastic modulus, GPa (lb/in2) 240b (35 X 106)c 10357c (150 X 106)c N.A. 393 (57 X 106) Hardness (Mohs scale) 1b, 10c 7 9.3 aCarbon sublimes (vaporizes) rather than melt. bCarbon in the form of graphite (typical value given). cCarbon in the form of diamond. \rN.A. = not available. \r\rin industrial applications where hardness is the critical factor (such as cutting and grinding tools). \rGraphite Graphite has a high content of crystalline carbon in the form of layers. Bonding between atoms in the layers is covalent and therefore strong, but the parallel layers are bonded to each other by weak van der Waals forces. This structure makes graphite quite anisotropic; strength and other properties vary significantly with direction. It explains why graphite can be used both as a lubricant and as a fiber in advanced composite materials. In powder form, graphite possesses low frictional characteristics due to the ease with which it shears between the layers; in this form, graphite is valued as a lubricant. In fiber form, graphite is oriented in the hexagonal planar direction to produce a filament material of very high strength and elastic modulus. These graphite fibers are used in structural composites ranging from tennis rackets to fighter aircraft components. \rGraphite exhibits certain high temperature properties that are both useful and unusual. It is resistant to thermal shock, and its strength actually increases with temperature. Tensile strength at room temperature is about 100 MPa (15,000 lb/in2), but increases to about twice thisvalue at2500\u00b0C (4500\u00b0F)[5].Theoreticaldensity ofcarbon is 2.22 gm/cm3, but apparent density of bulk graphite is lower due to porosity (around \r1.7 gm/cm3).This is increased through compacting and heating.Itis electrically conductive,butitsconductivity isnotashighasmostmetals.A disadvantageofgraphiteisthat it oxidizes in air above around 500\u00b0C (900\u00b0F). In a reducing atmosphere it can be used up to around 3000\u00b0C (5400\u00b0F), not far below its sublimation point of 3727\u00b0C (6740\u00b0F). The traditional form of graphite is polycrystalline with a certain amount of amor\rphous carbon in the mixture. Graphite crystals are often oriented (to a limited de\rgree) in the commercial production process to enhance properties in a preferred \rdirection for the application. Also, strength is improved by reducing grain size (simi\rlar to ceramics).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 40043, "end_char_idx": 44064, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab66b856-876d-427c-8df1-f156161dd2b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab66b856-876d-427c-8df1-f156161dd2b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec7.txt", "file_name": "Sec7.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47921, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0428f31f-7c60-4660-b08e-bc015d831e14", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec7.txt", "file_name": "Sec7.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47921, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "665d5b04699012d955288fffc4668da3f5ad329c62d06b99d8647fe665ee3ac3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a300a21-9045-4202-b31e-9decc9760ea6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/Sec7.txt", "file_name": "Sec7.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 47921, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "1560553f1a1ca5f1e191bc407a7d3f470d350252e9e28c8a20cee227cae9006c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "af0b093e-f5e3-4d70-a0e2-db8e113e506f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5c59274798f8836d4273e2a80c21192f026b4bd16e10db45e54e53ab4db101ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In a reducing atmosphere it can be used up to around 3000\u00b0C (5400\u00b0F), not far below its sublimation point of 3727\u00b0C (6740\u00b0F).

Graphite crystals are often oriented (to a limited de\rgree) in the commercial production process to enhance properties in a preferred \rdirection for the application. Also, strength is improved by reducing grain size (simi\rlar to ceramics). Graphite in this form is used for crucibles and other refractory ap\rplications, electrodes, resistance heating elements, antifriction materials, and fibers \rin composite materials. Thus, graphite is a very versatile material. As a powder it is a \rlubricant. In traditional solid form it is a refractory. And when formed into graphite \rfibers, it is a high-strength structural material. \rDiamond Diamond is carbon that possesses a cubic crystalline structure with covalent bonding between atoms, as shown in Figure 2.5(b). This structure is three-dimensional, rather than layered as in graphite carbon, and this accounts for the very high hardness of diamond. Single crystal natural diamonds (mined in South Africa) have a hardness of 10,000 HV, while the hardness of an industrial diamond (polycrystalline) is around 7000 HV. The high hardness accounts for most of the ap-plications of industrial diamond. It is used in cutting tools and grinding wheels for machining hard, brittle materials, or materials that are very abrasive. For example, diamond tools and wheels are used to cut ceramics, fiberglass, and hardened metals other than steels. Diamond is also used in dressing tools to sharpen grinding wheels that consist of other abrasives such as alumina and silicon carbide. Similar to graph-ite, diamond has a propensity to oxidize (decompose) in air at temperatures above about 650\u00b0C (1200\u00b0F). \rIndustrial or synthetic diamonds date back to the 1950s and are fabricated by heating graphite to around 3000\u00b0C (5400\u00b0F) under very high pressures (Figure 7.2). This process approximates the geological conditions by which natural diamonds were formed millions of years ago. \r\r\rti \rca \rll \rypr \ro \rduce \rd \ro \rnd p \ro \rwd er s \r. \r(P h\rdia m \ro \rt \ro \ro \r\ru \rrt \resy \ro \rfGE \r.) \r\r7.5.2 SILICON \rSilicon is a semimetallic element in the same group in the periodic table as carbon (Figure 2.1). Silicon is one of the most abundant elements in the Earth\u2019s crust, com-prising about 26% by weight (Table 7.1). It occurs naturally only as a chemical com-pound\u2014in rocks, sand, clay, and soil\u2014either as silicon dioxide or as more complex silicate compounds. As an element it has the same crystalline structure as diamond, but its hardness is lower. It is hard but brittle, lightweight, chemically inactive at room temperature, and is classified as a semiconductor. \rThe greatest amounts of silicon in manufacturing are in ceramic compounds (SiO2 in glass and silicates in clays) and alloying elements in steel, aluminum, and copper alloys. It is also used as a reducing agent in certain metallurgical processes. Of significant technological importance is pure silicon as the base material in semiconduc-tor manufacturing in electronics. The vast majority of integrated circuits produced today are made from silicon (Chapter 33). \r\r7.5.3 BORON \rBoron is a semimetallic element in the same periodic group as aluminum.

Casting and molding processes dominate this category of shaping operations. With reference to Figure 10.1, the solidi\ufb01cation processes can be classi\ufb01ed according to the engineering material that is processed: (1) metals, \r(2) ceramics, speci\ufb01cally glasses,1 and (3) polymers and polymer matrix composites (PMCs). Casting of metals is covered in this and the following chapter. Glassworking is covered in Chapter 12, and the processing of polymers and PMCs is treated in Chapters 13 and 14. \rCasting is a process in which molten metal \ufb02ows by gravity or other force into a mold where it solidi\ufb01es in the shape of the mold cavity. The term casting is also applied to the part that is made by this process. It is one of the oldest shaping processes, dating back 6000 years (Historical Note 10.1). The principle of casting seems simple: melt the metal, pour it into a mold, and let it cool and solidify; yet there are many factors and variables that must be considered in order to accomplish a successful casting operation. \rCasting includes both the casting of ingots and the casting of shapes. The term ingot is usually associated with the primary metals industries; it describes a large casting that is simple in shape and intended for \r1Among the ceramics, only glass is processed by solidi\ufb01cation; traditional and new ceramics are shaped using particulate processes (Chapter 16). \r\rSand casting \r\r\rCasting of metals can be traced back to around 4000 \rB.C.E. Gold was the \ufb01rst metal to be discovered and used by the early civilizations; it was malleable and could be readily hammered into shape at room temperature. There seemed to be no need for other ways to shape gold. It was the subsequent discovery of copper that gave rise to the need for casting. Although copper could be forged to shape, the process was more dif\ufb01cult (due to strain hardening) and limited to relatively simple forms. Historians believe that hundreds of years elapsed before the process of casting copper was \ufb01rst performed, probably by accident during the reduction of copper ore in preparation for hammering the metal into some useful form. Thus, through serendipity, the art of casting was born. It is likely that the discovery occurred in Mesopotamia, and the \u201ctechnology\u201d quickly spread throughout the rest of the ancient world. \rIt was an innovation of signi\ufb01 cant importance in the history of mankind. Shapes much more intricate could be formed by casting than by hammering. More sophisticated tools and weapons could be fabricated. More detailed implements and ornaments could be fashioned. Fine gold jewelry could be made more beautiful and valuable than by previous methods. Alloys were \ufb01 rst used for casting when it was \rOther casting processes \rdiscovered that mixtures of copper and tin (the alloy thus formed was bronze) yielded much better castings than copper alone.

Construction of cathedrals and churches required the casting of bells that were used in these structures. Indeed, the time and effort needed to cast the large bronze bells of the period helped to move the casting process from the realm of art toward the regimen of technology. Advances in melting and mold-making techniques were made. Pit molding, in which the molds were formed in a deep pit located in front of the furnace to simplify the pouring process, was improved as a casting procedure. In addition, the bell founder learned the relationships between the tone of the bell, which was the important measure of product quality, and its size, shape, thickness, and metal composition. \rAnother important product associated with the development of casting was the cannon. Chronologically, it followed the bell, and therefore many of the casting techniques developed for bell founding were applied to cannon making. The \ufb01 rst cast cannon was made in Ghent, Belgium, in the year 1313\u2014by a religious monk, of all people. It was made of bronze, and the bore was formed by means of a core during casting. Because of the rough bore surface created by the casting process, these early guns were not accurate and had to be \ufb01 red at relatively close range to be effective. It was soon realized that accuracy and range could be improved if the bore were made smooth by machining the surface. Quite appropriately, this machining process was called boring (Section 21.2.5). \r\r\rsubsequent reshaping by processes such as rolling or forging. Ingot casting is discussed in Chapter 6.

In the following chapter, the individual casting processes are described, along with some of the product design issues that must be considered when making parts out of castings. \r\r\r\rSection 10.1/Overview of Casting Technology  233  \rOverview of Casting Technology As a production process, casting is usually carried out in a foundry. A foundry is a factory equipped for making molds, melting and handling metal in molten form, performing the casting process, and cleaning the \ufb01nished casting. The workers who perform the casting operations in these factories are called foundrymen.  \r10.1.1  CASTING PROCESSES  \r\rDiscussion of casting logically begins with the mold. The mold contains a cavity whose geometry determines the shape of the cast part. The actual size and shape of the cavity must be slightly oversized to allow for shrinkage that occurs in the metal during solidi\ufb01cation and cooling. Different metals undergo different amounts of shrinkage, so the mold cavity must be designed for the particular metal to be cast if dimensional accuracy is critical. Molds are made of a variety of materials, including sand, plaster, ceramic, and metal. The various casting processes are often classi\ufb01ed according to these different types of molds. \rTo accomplish a casting operation, the metal is \ufb01rst heated to a temperature high enough to completely transform it into a liquid state. It is then poured, or otherwise directed, into the cavity of the mold. In an open mold, Figure 10.2(a), the liquid metal is simply poured until it \ufb01lls the open cavity. In a closed mold, Figure 10.2(b), a passageway, called the gating system, is provided to permit the molten metal to \ufb02ow from outside the mold into the cavity. The closed mold is by far the more important category in production casting operations. \rAs soon as the molten metal is in the mold, it begins to cool. When the temperature drops suf\ufb01ciently (e.g., to the freezing point for a pure metal), solidi\ufb01cation begins. Solidi\ufb01cation involves a change of phase of the metal. Time is required to complete the phase change, and considerable heat is given up in the process. It is during this step in the process that the metal assumes the solid shape of the mold cavity and many of the properties and characteristics of the casting are established. \rOnce the casting has cooled suf\ufb01 ciently, it is removed from the mold. Depending on the casting method and metal used, further processing may be required. This \r\r\rFIGURE 10.2 Two forms of mold: (a) open mold, simply a container in the shape of the desired part; and (b) closedmold, in which the mold geometry is more complex and requires a gating system (passageway) leading into the cavity. \rmay include trimming any excess metal from the actual cast part, cleaning the surface, inspecting the product, and heat treatment to enhance properties. In addition, machining may be required to achieve closer tolerances on certain part features and to remove the cast surface. \rCasting processes divide into two broad categories, according to type of mold used: expendable mold casting and permanent mold casting. An expendable mold means that the mold in which the molten metal solidi\ufb01es must be destroyed in order to remove the casting. These molds are made out of sand, plaster, or similar materials, whose form is maintained by using binders of various kinds. Sand casting is the most prominent example of the expendable mold processes. In sand casting, the liquid metal is poured into a mold made of sand. After the metal hardens, the mold must be sacri\ufb01ced in order to recover the casting. \rA permanent mold is one that can be used over and over to produce many castings.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6951, "end_char_idx": 11386, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f23253b-3558-424b-8b8e-6bb48c4fda89": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f23253b-3558-424b-8b8e-6bb48c4fda89", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec10.txt", "file_name": "sec10.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45400, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b941ba5b-9895-4724-bd90-6cb5bfa4061b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec10.txt", "file_name": "sec10.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45400, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "cdb2a55afd98e35635ffd31007e77bb1d08b99ff171ab1709d0b09544874c980", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a9320fed-d39e-4e44-94a2-9606a0f332ae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec10.txt", "file_name": "sec10.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45400, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4ef0347d5a13473213e991eda8bfd43b55d7ec8f2cd00ea269a2866173e3fb26", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5c67d6be-4a65-44c9-b028-9234845fd20e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dbbe10336ebbd14cb88a4c222c438701f52c0bf855da1fbe1bcf81002aecb6d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In addition, machining may be required to achieve closer tolerances on certain part features and to remove the cast surface. \rCasting processes divide into two broad categories, according to type of mold used: expendable mold casting and permanent mold casting.

After the metal hardens, the mold must be sacri\ufb01ced in order to recover the casting. \rA permanent mold is one that can be used over and over to produce many castings. It is made of metal (or, less commonly, a ceramic refractory material) that can withstand the high temperatures of the casting operation. In permanent mold casting, the mold consists of two (or more) sections that can be opened to permit removal of the \ufb01nished part. Die casting is the most familiar process in this group. \rMore intricate casting geometries are generally possible with the expendable mold processes. Part shapes in the permanent mold processes are limited by the need to open the mold. On the other hand, some of the permanent mold processes have certain economic advantages in high production operations. The expendable mold and permanent mold casting processes are described in Chapter 11. \r\r\r10.1.2 SAND-CASTING MOLDS \rSand casting is by far the most important casting process. A sand-casting mold will be used to describe the basic features of a mold. Many of these features and terms are common to the molds used in other casting processes. Figure 10.2(b) shows the cross-sectional view of a typical sand-casting mold, indicating some of the terminol-ogy.The mold consists of two halves:cope and drag.The cope is the upper half of the mold, and the drag is the bottom half. These two mold parts are contained in a box, called a \ufb02 ask, which is also divided into two halves, one for the cope and the other for the drag. The two halves of the mold separate at the parting line. \rIn sand casting (and other expendable mold processes) the mold cavity is formed by means of a pattern, which is made of wood, metal, plastic, or other material and has the shape of the part to be cast.The cavity is formed by packing sand around the pattern, about half each in the cope and drag, so that when the pattern is removed, the remaining void has the desired shape of the cast part. The pattern is usually made oversized to allow for shrinkage of the metal as it solidi\ufb01es and cools.The sand for the mold is moist and contains a binder to maintain its shape. \rThe cavity in the mold provides the external surfaces of the cast part. In addition, a casting may have internal surfaces. These surfaces are determined by means of a core, a form placed inside the mold cavity to de\ufb01ne the interior geometry of the part. In sand casting, cores are generally made of sand, although other materials can be used, such as metals, plaster, and ceramics. \rThe gating system in a casting mold is the channel, or network of channels, by which molten metal \ufb02ows into the cavity from outside the mold.As shown in the \ufb01gure, the gating system typically consists of a downsprue (also called simply the sprue), through which the metal enters a runner that leads into the main cavity.At the top of the downsprue, a pouring cup is often used to minimize splash and turbulence as the metal \ufb02ows into the downsprue. It is shown in the diagram as a simple cone-shaped funnel. Some pouring cups are designed in the shape of a bowl, with an open channel leading to the downsprue. \rIn addition to the gating system, any casting in which shrinkage is signi\ufb01cant requires a riser connected to the main cavity.The riser is a reservoir in the mold that serves as a source of liquid metal for the casting to compensate for shrinkage during solidi\ufb01cation. The riser must be designed to freeze after the main casting in order to satisfy its function. \rAs the metal \ufb02ows into the mold, the air that previously occupied the cavity, as well as hot gases formed by reactions of the molten metal, must be evacuated so that the metal will completely \ufb01ll the empty space.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 10561, "end_char_idx": 14924, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c67d6be-4a65-44c9-b028-9234845fd20e": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c67d6be-4a65-44c9-b028-9234845fd20e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec10.txt", "file_name": "sec10.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45400, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b941ba5b-9895-4724-bd90-6cb5bfa4061b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec10.txt", "file_name": "sec10.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45400, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "cdb2a55afd98e35635ffd31007e77bb1d08b99ff171ab1709d0b09544874c980", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f23253b-3558-424b-8b8e-6bb48c4fda89", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec10.txt", "file_name": "sec10.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45400, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "f1f942b847e79c69711cb202d3b2c726bb00907f1f0ba0977b639d7a017ae5f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "26ff108e-5df3-4d64-a994-82323771414b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "42d710a050dab599fa7f7b5ae8aea97762b4ddab996b0f190a4cc8b152f7490c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It is shown in the diagram as a simple cone-shaped funnel.

In sand casting, for example, the natural porosity of the sand mold permits the air and gases to escape through the walls of the cavity. In permanent metal molds, small vent holes are drilled into the mold or machined into the parting line to permit removal of air and gases. \r\r\r\r\rHeating and Pouring \rTo perform a casting operation, the metal must be heated to a temperature somewhat above its melting point and then poured into the mold cavity to solidify. Several aspects of these two steps are discussed in this section. \r\r10.2.1 HEATING THE METAL \r\rHeating furnaces of various kinds (Section 11.4.1) are used to heat the metal to a molten temperature suf\ufb01cient for casting.The heat energy required is the sum of (1) the heat to raise the temperature to the melting point, (2) the heat of fusion to convert it from solid to liquid, and (3) the heat to raise the molten metal to the desired temperature for pouring. This can be expressed: \rH ! r V{Cs (Tm \" To) # Hf # Cl (Tp \" Tm)} (10.1) \rwhere H ! total heat required to raise the temperature of the metal to the pouring temperature, J (Btu); r ! density, g/cm3 (lbm/in3); Cs ! weight speci\ufb01c heat for the solid metal, J/g-C (Btu/lbm-F); Tm ! melting temperature of the metal, C (F); To ! starting temperature\u2014usually ambient, C (F); Hf ! heat of fusion, J/g (Btu/ lbm); Cl ! weight speci\ufb01c heat of the liquid metal, J/g-C (Btu/lbm-F); Tp ! pouring temperature, C (F); and V  volume of metal being heated, cm3 (in3). \rOne cubic meter of a certain eutectic alloy is heated in a crucible from room \rtemperature to 100\u00b0C above its melting point for casting. The alloy\u2019s density ! \r7.5 g/cm3, melting point  800\u00b0C, speci\ufb01c heat  0.33 J/g\u00b0C in the solid state and 0.29 J/g\u00b0C in the liquid state; and heat of fusion  160 J/g. How much heat energy must be added to accomplish the heating, assuming no losses? \rSolution: Assume ambient temperature in the foundry  25\u00b0C and that the \rdensity of the liquid and solid states of the metal are the same. Noting that one \rm3  106 cm3, and substituting the property values into Equation (10.1), \rH  (7.5) (106){0.33(800  25)  160  0.29 (100)}  3335(106) J \r\rThe above equation is of conceptual value, but its computational value is limited, notwithstanding the calculation in Example 10.1. Use of Equation (10.1) is complicated by the following factors: (1) Speci\ufb01 c heat and other thermal properties of a solid metal vary with temperature, especially if the metal undergoes a change of phase during heating.

(5) There are signi\ufb01 cant heat losses to the environment during heating. \r\r10.2.2 POURING THE MOLTEN METAL \rAfter heating, the metal is ready for pouring. Introduction of molten metal into the mold, including its \ufb02ow through the gating system and into the cavity, is a critical step in the casting process. For this step to be successful, the metal must \ufb02ow into all regions of the mold before solidifying. Factors affecting the pouring operation include pouring temperature, pouring rate, and turbulence. \rThe pouring temperature is the temperature of the molten metal as it is introduced into the mold. What is important here is the difference between the temperature at pouring and the temperature at which freezing begins (the melting point for a pure metal or the liquidus temperature for an alloy).This temperature difference is sometimes referred to as the superheat.This term is also used for the amount of heat that must be removed from the molten metal between pouring and when solidi\ufb01cation commences [7]. \rPouring rate refers to the volumetric rate at which the molten metal is poured into the mold. If the rate is too slow, the metal will chill and freeze before \ufb01lling the cavity. If the pouring rate is excessive, turbulence can become a serious problem. Turbulence in \ufb02 uid \ufb02ow is characterized by erratic variations in the magnitude and direction of the velocity throughout the \ufb02 uid. The \ufb02ow is agitated and irregular rather than smooth and streamlined, as in laminar \ufb02 ow. Turbulent \ufb02ow should be avoided during pouring for several reasons. It tends to accelerate the formation of metal oxides that can become entrapped during solidi\ufb01cation, thus degrading the quality of the casting. Turbulence also aggravates mold erosion, the gradual wearing away of the mold surfaces due to impact of the \ufb02owing molten metal. The densities of most molten metals are much higher than water and other \ufb02uids normally encountered. These molten metals are also much more chemically reactive than at room temperature. Consequently, the wear caused by the \ufb02ow of these metals in the mold is signi\ufb01cant, especially under turbulent conditions. Erosion is especially serious when it occurs in the main cavity because the geometry of the cast part is affected. \r\r10.2.3 ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF POURING \rThere are several relationships that govern the \ufb02ow of liquid metal through the gating system and into the mold. An important relationship is Bernoulli\u2019s theorem, which states that the sum of the energies (head, pressure, kinetic, and friction) at any two points in a \ufb02owing liquid are equal. This can be written in the following form: \r2 p2 v2\rp1 v12\rh1 # # F1 ! h2 # # F2 (10.2)\rrr\r2g 2g \rwhere h ! head, cm (in), p ! pressure on the liquid, N/cm2 (lb/in2); r ! density, g/cm3 (lbm/in3); v  \ufb02ow velocity, cm/s (in/sec); g ! gravitational acceleration constant, 981 cm/s/s (32.2  12  386 in/sec/sec); and F  head losses due to friction, cm (in). Subscripts 1 and 2 indicate any two locations in the liquid \ufb02ow. \rBernoulli\u2019s equation can be simpli\ufb01ed in several ways. If friction losses are ignored (to be sure, friction will affect the liquid \ufb02ow through a sand mold), and the system is assumed to remain at atmospheric pressure throughout, then the equation can be reduced to \r2 v2\rv1\r___ ___2\rh1 !", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 17205, "end_char_idx": 21137, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bacb5415-a655-4266-808f-0083a2e16019": {"__data__": {"id_": "bacb5415-a655-4266-808f-0083a2e16019", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec10.txt", "file_name": "sec10.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45400, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b941ba5b-9895-4724-bd90-6cb5bfa4061b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec10.txt", "file_name": "sec10.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45400, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "cdb2a55afd98e35635ffd31007e77bb1d08b99ff171ab1709d0b09544874c980", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "26ff108e-5df3-4d64-a994-82323771414b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec10.txt", "file_name": "sec10.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45400, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "26df42faf51a464e50947a3aa395c280bd183d50d3efa041d90f298e575d3cb7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bd86e293-1d0f-4681-8cd4-98169e75e216", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bbfdba16b3a55b3208a0ab64d4d9ae474bb472f2b28316e1ac3c9167ed45de93", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "head, cm (in), p ! pressure on the liquid, N/cm2 (lb/in2); r ! density, g/cm3 (lbm/in3); v  \ufb02ow velocity, cm/s (in/sec); g ! gravitational acceleration constant, 981 cm/s/s (32.2  12  386 in/sec/sec); and F  head losses due to friction, cm (in). Subscripts 1 and 2 indicate any two locations in the liquid \ufb02ow. \rBernoulli\u2019s equation can be simpli\ufb01ed in several ways.

Let point 1 be de\ufb01ned at the top of the sprue and point 2 at its base. If point 2 is used as the reference plane, then the head at that point is zero (h2 ! 0) and h1 is the height (length) of the sprue. When the metal is poured into the pouring cup and over\ufb02ows down the sprue, its initial velocity at the top is zero (v1 ! 0). Hence, Equation (10.3) further simpli\ufb01es to \rv2 \r___2\rh1 ! \r2g which can be solved for the \ufb02ow velocity: \rv ! 2gh (10.4) \rwhere v  the velocity of the liquid metal at the base of the sprue, cm/s (in/sec); g  981 cm/s/s (386 in/sec/sec); and h  the height of the sprue, cm (in). \rAnother relationship of importance during pouring is the continuity law, which states that the volume rate of \ufb02ow remains constant throughout the liquid. The volume \ufb02ow rate is equal to the velocity multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the \ufb02owing liquid. The continuity law can be expressed:\r Q ! v1 A1 ! v2 A2 (10.5) \rwhere Q ! volumetric \ufb02ow rate, cm3/s (in3/sec); v ! velocity as before; A ! cross-sectional area of the liquid, cm2 (in2); and the subscripts refer to any two points in the \ufb02ow system.Thus,an increase in area results in a decrease in velocity,and vice versa. \rEquations (10.4) and (10.5) indicate that the sprue should be tapered. As the metal accelerates during its descent into the sprue opening, the cross-sectional area of the channel must be reduced; otherwise, as the velocity of the \ufb02owing metal increases toward the base of the sprue, air can be aspirated into the liquid and conducted into the mold cavity. To prevent this condition, the sprue is designed with a taper, so that the volume \ufb02 ow rate vA is the same at the top and bottom of the sprue. \rAssuming that the runner from the sprue base to the mold cavity is horizontal (and therefore the head h is the same as at the sprue base), then the volume rate of \ufb02ow through the gate and into the mold cavity remains equal to vA at the base. Accordingly, the time required to \ufb01ll a mold cavity of volume V can be estimated as \r\rTMF ! QV (10.6) \r\rwhere TMF ! mold \ufb01lling time, s (sec); V ! volume of mold cavity, cm3 (in3); and Q ! volume \ufb02ow rate, as before.

Fluidity is the inverse of viscosity (Section 3.4); as viscosity increases, \ufb02uidity decreases. Standard testing methods are available to assess \ufb02uidity, including the spiral mold test shown in Figure 10.3, in which \ufb02uidity is indicated by the length of the solidi\ufb01ed metal in the spiral channel. A longer cast spiral means greater \ufb02uidity of the molten metal. \rFactors affecting \ufb02uidity include pouring temperature relative to melting point, metal composition, viscosity of the liquid metal, and heat transfer to the surroundings. A higher pouring temperature relative to the freezing point of the metal increases the time it remains in the liquid state, allowing it to \ufb02ow further before freezing. \rFIGURE 10.3 Spiralmold test for \ufb02uidity, in which \ufb02uidity is measured as the lengthof the spiral channelthat is \ufb01lled by the molten metal prior tosolidi\ufb01cation. \r\rThis tends to aggravate certain casting problems such as oxide formation, gas porosity, and penetration of liquid metal into the interstitial spaces between the grains of sand forming the mold. This last problem causes the surface of the casting to contain imbedded sand particles, thus making it rougher and more abrasive than normal. \rComposition also affects \ufb02uidity, particularly with respect to the metal\u2019s solidi\ufb01 cation mechanism. The best \ufb02uidity is obtained by metals that freeze at a constant temperature (e.g.,pure metals and eutectic alloys).When solidi\ufb01cation occurs over a temperature range (most alloys are in this category), the partially solidi\ufb01ed portion interferes with the \ufb02ow of the liquid portion, thereby reducing \ufb02uidity. In addition to the freezing mechanism, metal composition also determines heat of fusion\u2014the amount of heat required to solidify the metal from the liquid state. A higher heat of fusion tends to increase the measured \ufb02uidity in casting. \r\r\r\r\rSolidi\ufb01cation and Cooling \rAfter pouring into the mold, the molten metal cools and solidi\ufb01es.

The solidi\ufb01cation process differs depending on whether the metal is a pure element or an alloy. \rPure Metals A pure metal solidi\ufb01es at a constant temperature equal to its freezing point, which is the same as its melting point. The melting points of pure metals are well known and documented (Table 4.1).The process occurs over time as shown in the plot of Figure 10.4, called a cooling curve. The actual freezing takes time, called the local solidi\ufb01 cation time in casting, during which the metal\u2019s latent heat of fusion is released into the surrounding mold. The total solidi\ufb01 cation time is the time taken between pouring and complete solidi\ufb01cation. After the casting has completely solidi\ufb01ed, cooling continues at a rate indicated by the downward slope of the cooling curve. \r\r\rBecause of the chilling action of the mold wall, a thin skin of solid metal is initially formed at the interface immediately after pouring.Thickness of the skin increases to form a shell around the molten metal as solidi\ufb01cation progresses inward toward the center of the cavity. The rate at which freezing proceeds depends on heat transfer into the mold, as well as the thermal properties of the metal. \rIt is of interest to examine the metallic grain formation and growth during this solidi\ufb01cation process.The metal which forms the initial skin has been rapidly cooled by the extraction of heat through the mold wall.This cooling action causes the grains in the skin to be \ufb01ne and randomly oriented. As cooling continues, further grain formation and growth occur in a direction away from the heat transfer. Since the heat transfer is through the skin and mold wall, the grains grow inwardly as needles or spines of solid metal. As these spines enlarge, lateral branches form, and as these branches grow, further branches form at right angles to the \ufb01rst branches. This type of grain growth is referred to as dendritic growth, and it occurs not only in the freezing of pure metals but alloys as well. These treelike structures are gradually \ufb01lled-in during freezing, as additional metal is continually deposited onto the dendrites until complete solidi\ufb01cation has occurred.The grains resulting from this dendritic growth take on a preferred orientation, tending to be coarse, columnar grains aligned toward the center of the casting. The resulting grain formation is illustrated in Figure 10.5. \rMost Alloys Most alloys freeze over a temperature range rather than at a single temperature. The exact range depends on the alloy system and the particular composition. Solidi\ufb01cation of an alloy can be explained with reference to Figure 10.6, which shows the phase diagram for a particular alloy system (Section 6.1.2) and the cooling curve for a given composition. As temperature drops, freezing begins at the temperature indicated by the liquidus and is completed when the solidus is reached. The start of freezing is similar to that of the pure metal.

The latter condition is promoted by factors such as slow heat transfer out of the hot metal and a wide difference between liquidus and solidus temperatures. Gradually, the liquid islands in the dendrite matrix solidify as the temperature of the casting drops to the solidus for the given alloy composition. \rAnother factor complicating solidi\ufb01cation of alloys is that the composition of the dendrites as they start to form favors the metal with the higher melting point. As freezing continues and the dendrites grow, there develops an imbalance in composition between the metal that has solidi\ufb01ed and the remaining molten metal. This composition imbalance is \ufb01nally manifested in the completed casting in the form of segregation of the elements. The segregation is of two types, microscopic and macroscopic.At the microscopic level,the chemical composition varies throughout each individual grain. This is due to the fact that the beginning spine of each dendrite has a higher proportion of one of the elements in the alloy. As the dendrite grows in its local vicinity, it must expand using the remaining liquid metal that has been partially depleted of the \ufb01rst component. Finally, the last metal to freeze in each grain is that which has been trapped by the branches of the dendrite, and its composition is even further out of balance. Thus, there is a variation in chemical composition within single grains of the casting. \rAt the macroscopic level, the chemical composition varies throughout the entire casting. Since the regions of the casting that freeze \ufb01rst (at the outside near the mold walls) are richer in one component than the other, the remaining molten alloy is deprived of that component by the time freezing occurs at the interior. Thus, there is a general segregation through the cross section of the casting, sometimes called ingot segregation, as illustrated in Figure 10.7. \rEutectic Alloys Eutectic alloys constitute an exception to the general process by which alloys solidify. A eutectic alloy is a particular composition in an alloy system for which the solidus and liquidus are at the same temperature. Hence, solidi\ufb01cation occurs at a constant temperature rather than over a temperature range, as described above. The effect can be seen in the phase diagram of the lead\u2013tin system shown in \r\r\r\rFIGURE 10.7 Characteristic grain structure in an alloycasting, showing segregation of alloying components in thecenter of casting. \rFigure 6.3. Pure lead has a melting point of 327\u00b0C (621\u00b0F), while pure tin melts at 232\u00b0C (450\u00b0F). Although most lead\u2013tin alloys exhibit the typical solidus\u2013liquidus temperature range, the particular composition of 61.9% tin and 38.1% lead has a melting (freezing) point of 183\u00b0C (362\u00b0F).

The total solidi\ufb01cation time is the time required for the casting to solidify after pouring.This time is dependent on the size and shape of the casting by an empirical relationship known as Chvorinov\u2019s rule, which states: \r__V\rTTS  Cm ()n (10.7)\rA \r\rwhere TTS  total solidi\ufb01cation time, min; V  volume of the casting, cm3 (in3); A  surface area of the casting, cm2 (in2); n is an exponent usually taken to have a value  2; and Cm is the mold constant. Given that n  2, the units of Cm are min/cm2 (min/in2), and its value depends on the particular conditions of the casting operation, including mold material (e.g., speci\ufb01c heat, thermal conductivity), thermal properties of the cast metal (e.g., heat of fusion, speci\ufb01c heat, thermal conductivity), and pouring temperature relative to the melting point of the metal. The value of Cm for a given casting operation can be based on experimental data from previous operations carried out using the same mold material, metal, and pouring temperature, even though the shape of the part may be quite different. \rChvorinov\u2019s rule indicates that a casting with a higher volume-to-surface area ratio will cool and solidify more slowly than one with a lower ratio. This principle is put to good use in designing the riser in a mold. To perform its function of feeding molten metal to the main cavity, the metal in the riser must remain in the liquid phase longer than the casting. In other words, the TTS for the riser must exceed the TTS for the main casting. Since the mold conditions for both riser and casting are the same, their mold constants will be equal. By designing the riser to have a larger volume-to-area ratio, the main casting will most likely solidify \ufb01rst and the effects of shrinkage will be minimized. Before discussing how the riser might be designed based on Chvorinov\u2019s rule, consider the topic of shrinkage, which is the reason why risers are needed. \r\r10.3.3 SHRINKAGE \rThe discussion of solidi\ufb01cation has neglected the impact of shrinkage that occurs during cooling and freezing. Shrinkage occurs in three steps: (1) liquid contraction during cooling prior to solidi\ufb01 cation; (2) contraction during the phase change from liquid to solid, called solidi\ufb01 cation shrinkage; and (3) thermal contraction of the solidi\ufb01 ed casting during cooling to room temperature. The three steps can be explained with reference to a cylindrical casting made in an open mold, as shown in Figure 10.8. The molten metal immediately after pouring is shown in part (0) of the series. Contraction of the liquid metal during cooling from pouring temperature to freezing temperature causes the height of the liquid to be reduced from its starting level as in (1) of the \ufb01 gure. The amount of this liquid contraction is usually around 0.5%. Solidi\ufb01 cation shrinkage, seen in part (2), has two effects. First, contraction causes a further reduction in the height of the casting. Second, the amount of liquid metal available to feed the top center portion of the casting becomes restricted.This is usually the last region to freeze, and the absence of metal creates a void in the casting at this location. This shrinkage cavity is called a pipe by foundrymen. Once solidi\ufb01ed, the casting experiences further contraction in height and diameter while cooling, as in (3).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 33118, "end_char_idx": 37108, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4881439c-d37f-4091-b0db-ecf2d854cdb5": {"__data__": {"id_": "4881439c-d37f-4091-b0db-ecf2d854cdb5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec10.txt", "file_name": "sec10.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45400, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b941ba5b-9895-4724-bd90-6cb5bfa4061b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec10.txt", "file_name": "sec10.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45400, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "cdb2a55afd98e35635ffd31007e77bb1d08b99ff171ab1709d0b09544874c980", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "60c0436e-edb0-4bd5-9b49-a451c310157f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec10.txt", "file_name": "sec10.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 45400, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "3e16e84bbda9eef4624c95207f3b4f12cea5e285f02fcea23a6a0ac537f4f797", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0ba29a67-8a88-4297-a187-747f7122327b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2c4cd99d31ed336b95907742155672a8a5993eb8a4df0425183ae15bf48f6c18", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The molten metal immediately after pouring is shown in part (0) of the series.

For clarity, dimensional reductions are exaggerated in our sketches. \r\r\rTABLE \u2022 10.1 Typical linear shrinkage values for different casting metals due to solid thermal contraction. \r\rCompiled from [10]. \rSolidi\ufb01cation shrinkage occurs in nearly all metals because the solid phase has a higher density than the liquid phase. The phase transformation that accompanies solidi\ufb01cation causes a reduction in the volume per unit weight of metal. The exception is cast iron containing high carbon content, whose solidi\ufb01cation during the \ufb01nal stages of freezing is complicated by a period of graphitization, which results in expansion that tends to counteract the volumetric decrease associated with the phase change [7]. Compensation for solidi\ufb01cation shrinkage is achieved in several ways depending on the casting operation. In sand casting, liquid metal is supplied to the cavity by means of risers (Section 10.3.5). In die casting (Section 11.3.3), the molten metal is applied under pressure. \rPattern-makers account for thermal contraction by making the mold cavities oversized. The amount by which the mold must be made larger relative to the \ufb01nal casting size is called the pattern shrinkage allowance. Although the shrinkage is volumetric, the dimensions of the casting are expressed linearly, so the allowances must be applied accordingly. Special \u201cshrink rules\u201d with slightly elongated scales are used to make the patterns and molds larger than the desired casting by the appropriate amount. Table 10.1 lists typical values of linear shrinkage for various cast metals; these values can be used to determine shrink rule scales. \r\r10.3.4 DIRECTIONAL SOLIDIFICATION \rIn order to minimize the damaging effects of shrinkage, it is desirable for the regions of the casting most distant from the liquid metal supply to freeze \ufb01rst and for solidi\ufb01cation to progress from these remote regions toward the riser(s). In this way, molten metal will continually be available from the risers to prevent shrinkage voids during freezing. The term directional solidi\ufb01 cation is used to describe this aspect of the freezing process and the methods by which it is controlled. The desired directional solidi\ufb01cation is achieved by observing Chvorinov\u2019s rule in the design of the casting itself,its orientation within the mold, and the design of the riser system that feeds it. For example, by locating sections of the casting with lower V/A ratios away from the riser, freezing will occur \ufb01rst in these regions and the supply of liquid metal for the rest of the casting will remain open until these bulkier sections solidify. \rAnother way to encourage directional solidi\ufb01cation is to use chills\u2014internal or external heat sinks that cause rapid freezing in certain regions of the casting. Internal chills are small metal parts placed inside the cavity before pouring so that the molten metal will solidify \ufb01rst around these parts.

They are often used effectively in sections of the casting that are dif\ufb01 cult to feed with liquid metal, thus encouraging rapid freezing in these sections while the connection to liquid metal is still open. Figure 10.9 illustrates a possible application of external chills and the likely result in the casting if the chill were not used. \rAs important as it is to initiate freezing in the appropriate regions of the cavity, it is also important to avoid premature solidi\ufb01cation in sections of the mold nearest the riser. Of particular concern is the passageway between the riser and the main cavity. This connection must be designed in such a way that it does not freeze before the casting,which would isolate the casting from the molten metal in the riser.Although it is generally desirable to minimize the volume in the connection (to reduce wasted metal),the cross-sectional area must be suf\ufb01cient to delay the onset of freezing.This goal is usually aided by making the passageway short in length, so that it absorbs heat from the molten metal in the riser and the casting. \r\r\r10.3.5 RISER DESIGN \r\r\r\rAs described earlier, a riser, Figure 10.2(b), is used in a sand-casting mold to feed liquid metal to the casting during freezing in order to compensate for solidi\ufb01cation shrinkage. To function, the riser must remain molten until after the casting solidi\ufb01es. Chvorinov\u2019s rule can be used to compute the size of a riser that will satisfy this requirement. The following example illustrates the calculation. \rA cylindrical riser must be designed for a sand-casting mold.

In expendable mold casting operations, the mold is sacri\ufb01 ced in order to remove the cast part. Since a new mold is required for each new casting, production rates in expendable-mold processes are often limited by the time required to make the mold rather than the time to make the casting itself. However, for certain part geometries, sand molds can be produced and castings made at rates of 400 parts per hour and higher. In permanent mold casting processes, the mold is fabricated out of metal (or other durable material) and can be used many times to make many castings. Accordingly, these processes possess a natural advantage in terms of higher production rates. \rThe discussion of casting processes in this chapter is organized as follows: (1) sand casting, (2) other expendable mold casting processes, and (3) permanent mold casting processes. The chapter also includes casting equipment and practices used in foundries.Another section deals with inspection and quality issues. Product design guidelines are presented in the \ufb01nal section. \r\r\r\r\rSand Casting \rSand casting is the most widely used casting process, accounting for a signi\ufb01 cant majority of the total tonnage cast. Nearly all casting alloys can be sand cast; indeed, it is one of the few processes that can be used for metals with high melting temperatures, such as steels, nickels, and titaniums. Its versatility permits the casting of parts ranging in size from small to very large and in production quantities from one to millions. Figure 11.1 shows a cast iron sand casting of a pump housing that has been partially machined to create accurate holes and surfaces. \rSand casting, also known as sand-mold casting, consists of pouring molten metal into a sand mold, allowing the metal to solidify, and then breaking up the mold to remove the casting. The casting must then be cleaned and inspected, and heat treatment is sometimes required \r\rFIGURE 11.1 A sand casting for anindustrial pump. Holesand surfaces have been machined. (Courtesy of George E.Kane ManufacturingTechnology Laboratory,Lehigh University.) \r\rto improve metallurgical properties. The cavity in the sand mold is formed by packing sand around a pattern (an approximate duplicate of the part to be cast), and then removing the pattern by separating the mold into two halves. The mold also contains the gating and riser system. In addition, if the casting is to have internal surfaces (e.g., hollow parts or parts with holes), a core must be included in the mold. Since the mold is sacri\ufb01ced to remove the casting, a new sand mold must be made for each part that is produced. From this brief description, sand casting is seen to include not only the casting operation itself, but also the fabrication of the pattern and the making of the mold.

From this brief description, sand casting is seen to include not only the casting operation itself, but also the fabrication of the pattern and the making of the mold. The production sequence is outlined in Figure 11.2. \r11.1.1 PATTERNS AND CORES \rSand casting requires a pattern\u2014a full-sized model of the part, enlarged to account for shrinkage and machining allowances in the \ufb01 nal casting. Materials used to make patterns include wood, plastics, and metals. Wood is a common pattern material because it is easily shaped. Its disadvantages are that it tends to warp, and it is abraded by the sand being compacted around it, thus limiting the number of times it can be reused. Metal patterns are more expensive to make, but they last much longer. Plastics represent a compromise between wood and metal. Selection of the appropriate pattern material depends to a large extent on the total quantity of castings to be made. \r\rThere are various types of patterns, as illustrated in Figure 11.3. The simplest is made of one piece, called a solid pattern\u2014same geometry as the casting, adjusted in size for shrinkage and machining. Although it is the easiest pattern to fabricate, it is not the easiest to use in making the sand mold. Determining the location of the parting line between the two halves of the mold for a solid pattern can be a problem, and incorporating the gating system and sprue into the mold is left to the judgment and skill of the foundry worker. Consequently, solid patterns are generally limited to very low production quantities. \rSplit patterns consist of two pieces, dividing the part along a plane coinciding with the parting line of the mold. Split patterns are appropriate for complex part geometries and moderate production quantities. The parting line of the mold is predetermined by the two pattern halves, rather than by operator judgment. \rFor higher production quantities, match-plate patterns or cope-and-drag patterns are used. In match-plate patterns, the two pieces of the split pattern are attached to opposite sides of a wood or metal plate. Holes in the plate allow the top and bottom (cope and drag) sections of the mold to be aligned accurately. Cope-anddrag patterns are similar to match-plate patterns except that split pattern halves are \r\r\r(d) cope and drag pattern. \r\r(c) casting with internal cavity. \rattached to separate plates, so that the cope and drag sections of the mold can be fabricated independently, instead of using the same tooling for both. Part (d) of the \ufb01 gure includes the gating and riser system in the cope-and-drag patterns. \rPatterns de\ufb01ne the external shape of the cast part. If the casting is to have internal surfaces, a core is required. A core is a full-scale model of the interior surfaces of the part. It is inserted into the mold cavity prior to pouring, so that the molten metal will \ufb02ow and solidify between the mold cavity and the core to form the casting\u2019s external and internal surfaces. The core is usually made of sand, compacted into the desired shape. As with the pattern, the actual size of the core must include allowances for shrinkage and machining. Depending on the geometry of the part, the core may or may not require supports to hold it in position in the mold cavity during pouring. These supports, called chaplets, are made of a metal with a higher melting temperature than the casting metal. For example, steel chaplets would be used for cast iron castings. On pouring and solidi\ufb01cation, the chaplets become bonded into the casting. A possible arrangement of a core in a mold using chaplets is sketched in Figure 11.4. The portion of the chaplet protruding from the casting is subsequently cut off. \r\r11.1.2 MOLDS AND MOLD MAKING \rFoundry sands are silica (SiO2) or silica mixed with other minerals.

The sand should possess good refractory properties\u2014capacity to stand up under high temperatures without melting or otherwise degrading. Other important features of the sand include grain size, distribution of grain size in the mixture, and shape of the individual grains (Section 15.1). Small grain size provides a better surface \ufb01nish on the cast part, but large grain size is more permeable (to allow escape of gases during pouring). Molds made from grains of irregular shape tend to be stronger than molds of round grains because of interlocking, yet interlocking tends to restrict permeability. \rIn making the mold, the grains of sand are held together by a mixture of water and bonding clay. A typical mixture (by volume) is 90% sand, 3% water, and 7% clay. Other bonding agents can be used in place of clay, including organic resins (e.g., phenolic resins) and inorganic binders (e.g., sodium silicate and phosphate). \rBesides sand and binder, additives are sometimes combined with the mixture to enhance properties such as strength and/or permeability of the mold. \rTo form the mold cavity, the traditional method is to compact the molding sand around the pattern for both cope and drag in a container called a \ufb02 ask. The packing process is performed by various methods. The simplest is hand ramming, accomplished manually by a foundry worker. In addition, various machines have been developed to mechanize the packing procedure. These machines operate by any of several mechanisms, including (1) squeezing the sand around the pattern by pneumatic pressure; (2) a jolting action in which the sand, contained in the \ufb02ask with the pattern, is dropped repeatedly in order to pack it into place; and \r(3) a slinging action, in which the sand grains are impacted against the pattern at high speed. \rAn alternative to traditional \ufb02asks for each sand mold is \ufb02 askless molding, which refers to the use of one master \ufb02ask in a mechanized system of mold production. Each sand mold is produced using the same master \ufb02ask. Mold production rates up to 600 per hour are claimed for this more automated method [8]. \rSeveral indicators are used to determine the quality of the sand mold [7]: \r(1) strength\u2014the mold\u2019s ability to maintain its shape and resist erosion caused by the \ufb02ow of molten metal; it depends on grain shape, adhesive qualities of the binder, and other factors; (2) permeability\u2014capacity of the mold to allow hot air and gases from the casting operation to pass through the voids in the sand; (3) thermal stability\u2014ability of the sand at the surface of the mold cavity to resist cracking and buckling upon contact with the molten metal; (4) collapsibility\u2014ability of the mold to give way and allow the casting to shrink without cracking the casting; it also refers to the ability to remove the sand from the casting during cleaning; and (5) reusability\u2014can the sand from the broken mold be reused to make other molds? These measures are sometimes incompatible; for example, a mold with greater strength is less collapsible. \rSand molds are often classi\ufb01ed as green-sand, dry-sand, or skin-dried molds.

Green-sand molds are made of a mixture of sand, clay, and water, the word green referring to the fact that the mold contains moisture at the time of pouring. Green-sand molds possess suf\ufb01cient strength for most applications, good collapsibility, good permeability, good reusability, and are the least expensive of the molds. They are the most widely used mold type, but they are not without problems. Moisture in the sand can cause defects in some castings, depending on the metal and geometry of the part.A dry-sand mold is made using organic binders rather than clay, and the mold is baked in a large oven at temperatures ranging from 200\u00b0C to 320\u00b0C (400\u00b0F\u2013 600\u00b0F) [8]. Oven baking strengthens the mold and hardens the cavity surface. A dry-sand mold provides better dimensional control in the cast product, compared to green-sand molding. However, dry-sand molding is more expensive, and production rate is reduced because of drying time. Applications are generally limited to medium and large castings in low to medium production rates. In a skin-dried mold, the advantages of a dry-sand mold is partially achieved by drying the surface of a green-sand mold to a depth of 10 to 25 mm (0.4\u20131 in) at the mold cavity surface, using torches, heating lamps, or other means. Special bonding materials must be added to the sand mixture to strengthen the cavity surface. \rThe preceding mold classi\ufb01cations refer to the use of conventional binders consisting of either clay-and-water or ones that require heating to cure. In addition to these classi\ufb01cations, chemically bonded molds have been developed that are not based on either of these traditional binder ingredients.

No-bake molds are growing in popularity due to their good dimensional control in high production applications. \r\r11.1.3 THE CASTING OPERATION \r\rAfter the core is positioned (if one is used) and the two halves of the mold are clamped together, then casting is performed. Casting consists of pouring, solidi\ufb01 cation,and cooling of the cast part (Sections 10.2 and 10.3).The gating and riser system in the mold must be designed to deliver liquid metal into the cavity and provide for a suf\ufb01cient reservoir of molten metal during solidi\ufb01 cation shrinkage. Air and gases must be allowed to escape. \rOne of the hazards during pouring is that the buoyancy of the molten metal will displace the core. Buoyancy results from the weight of molten metal being displaced by the core, according to Archimedes\u2019 principle. The force tending to lift the core is equal to the weight of the displaced liquid less the weight of the core itself. Expressing the situation in equation form, \rFb ! Wm \" Wc (11.1) \r\rwhere Fb  buoyancy force, N (lb); Wm  weight of molten metal displaced, N (lb); and % Wc ! weight of the core, N (lb). Weights are determined as the volume of the core multiplied by the respective densities of the core material (typically sand) and the metal being cast.

The differences between these methods are in the composition of the mold material, or the manner in which the mold is made, or in the way the pattern is made.  \r11.2.1  SHELL MOLDING  \r\r\rShell molding is a casting process in which the mold is a thin shell (typically 9 mm or 3/8 in) made of sand held together by a thermosetting resin binder. Developed in Germany during the early 1940s, the process is described and illustrated in Figure 11.5. \rThere are many advantages to the shell-molding process.

This makes shell molding dif\ufb01cult to justify for small quantities of parts. Shell molding can be mechanized for mass production and is very economical for large quantities. It seems particularly suited to steel castings of less than 20 lb. Examples of parts made using shell molding include gears, valve bodies, bushings, and camshafts. \r\r11.2.2 VACUUM MOLDING \rVacuum molding, also called the V-process, was developed in Japan around 1970. It uses a sand mold held together by vacuum pressure rather than by a chemical binder. Accordingly, the term vacuum in this process refers to the making of the mold rather than the casting operation itself.The steps of the process are explained in Figure 11.6. \r\r(3) another thin plastic sheet is placed over the \ufb02 ask, and a vacuum is drawn that causes the sand grains to be heldtogether, forming a rigid mold; (4) the vacuum on the mold pattern is released to permit the pattern to be stripped from the mold; (5) this mold is assembled with its matching half to form the cope and drag, and with vacuum maintained onboth halves, pouring is accomplished. The plastic sheet quickly burns away on contacting the molten metal.After solidi\ufb01cation, nearly all of the sand can be recovered for reuse. \rBecause no binders are used, the sand is readily recovered in vacuum molding. Also, the sand does not require extensive mechanical reconditioning normally done when binders are used in the molding sand. Since no water is mixed with the sand, moisture-related defects are absent from the product. Disadvantages of the V-process are that it is relatively slow and not readily adaptable to mechanization. \r\r\r11.2.3 EXPANDED POLYSTYRENE PROCESS \rThe expanded polystyrene casting process uses a mold of sand packed around a polystyrene foam pattern that vaporizes when the molten metal is poured into the mold. The process and variations of it are known by other names, including lost-foam process, lost-pattern process, evaporative-foam process, and full-mold process (the last being a trade name). The foam pattern includes the sprue, risers, and gating system, and it may also contain internal cores (if needed), thus eliminating the need for a separate core in the mold.Also,since the foam pattern itself becomes the cavity in the mold, considerations of draft and parting lines can be ignored. The mold does not have to be opened into cope and drag sections. The sequence in this casting process is illustrated and described in Figure 11.7. Various methods for making the pattern can be used, depending on the quantities of castings to be produced. For one-of-a-kind castings, the foam is manually cut from large strips and assembled to form the pattern. For large production runs, an automated molding operation can be set up to mold the patterns prior to making the molds for casting. The pattern is normally coated with a refractory compound to provide a smoother surface on the pattern and to improve its high temperature resistance. Molding sands usually include bonding agents. However, dry sand is used in certain processes in this group, which aids recovery and reuse. \rA signi\ufb01cant advantage for this process is that the pattern need not be removed from the mold.This simpli\ufb01es and expedites mold making.In a conventional green-sand mold, two halves are required with proper parting lines, draft allowances must be provided in the mold design, cores must be inserted, and the gating and riser system must be added. With the expanded polystyrene process, these steps \r\r\r(2) foam pattern is placed in mold box, and sand is compacted around the pattern; and (3) molten metal is poured intothe portion of the pattern that forms the pouring cup and sprue.

A new pattern is needed for every casting, so the economics of the expanded polystyrene casting process depend largely on the cost of producing the patterns. The process has been applied to mass produce castings for automobiles engines. Automated production systems are installed to mold the polystyrene foam patterns for these applications. Figure 11.8 shows an aluminum engine head that was cast by the expanded polystyrene process (the holes and some surfaces have been machined). \r\r11.2.4 INVESTMENT CASTING \rIn investment casting, a pattern made of wax is coated with a refractory material to make the mold, after which the wax is melted away prior to pouring the molten metal. The term investment comes from one of the less familiar de\ufb01 nitions of the word invest, which is \u201cto cover completely,\u201d this referring to the coating of the refractory material around the wax pattern. It is a precision casting process, because it is capable of making castings of high accuracy and intricate detail. The process dates back to ancient Egypt (Historical Note 11.1) and is also known as the lost-wax process, because the wax pattern is lost from the mold prior to casting. \rHistorical Note 11.1 Investment casting \rThe lost wax casting process was developed by the ancient Egyptians some 3,500 years ago. Although written records do not identify when the invention occurred or the artisan responsible, historians speculate that the process resulted from the close association between pottery and molding in early times. It was the potter who crafted the molds that were used for casting. The idea for the lost wax process must have originated with a potter who was familiar with the casting process. As he was working one day on a ceramic piece\u2014perhaps an ornate vase or bowl\u2014it occurred to him that the article might be more attractive and durable if made of metal. So he fashioned a core in the general shape of the piece, but smaller than the desired \ufb01nal dimensions, and coated it with wax to establish the size. The wax proved to be an easy material to form, and intricate designs and shapes could be created by the craftsman. On the wax surface, he carefully plastered several layers of clay and devised a means of holding the resulting components together. He then baked the mold in a kiln, so that the clay hardened and the wax melted and drained out to form a cavity. At last, he poured molten bronze into the cavity and, after the casting had solidi\ufb01ed and cooled, broke away the mold to recover the part. Considering the education and experience of this early pottery maker and the tools he had to work with, development of the lost wax casting process demonstrated great innovation and insight. \u201cNo other process can be named by archeologists so crowded with deduction, engineering ability and ingenuity\u201d [14]. \rSteps in investment casting are described in Figure 11.9.

Since the wax pattern is melted off after the refractory mold is made, a separate pattern must be made for every casting. Pattern production is usually accomplished by a molding operation\u2014 pouring or injecting the hot wax into a master die that has been designed with proper allowances for shrinkage of both wax and subsequent metal casting. In cases where the part geometry is complicated, several separate wax pieces must be joined to make the pattern. In high-production operations, several patterns are attached to a sprue, also made of wax, to form a pattern tree; this is the geometry that will be cast out of metal. \r\rFIGURE 11.9 Steps in investment casting: (1) wax patterns are produced; (2) severalpatterns are attached to a sprue to form a pattern tree; (3) the pattern tree is coatedwith a thin layer of refractory material; (4) the full mold is formed by covering the coatedtree with suf\ufb01cient refractory material to make it rigid; (5) the mold is held in an inverted position and heated to melt the wax and permit it to drip out of the cavity; (6) the moldis preheated to a high temperature, which ensures that all contaminants are eliminatedfrom the mold; it also permits the liquid metal to \ufb02ow more easily into the detailed cavity; the molten metal is poured; it solidi\ufb01es; and (7) the mold is broken away from the \ufb01nished casting. Parts are separated from the sprue. \r\r\rCoating with refractory (step 3) is usually accomplished by dipping the pattern tree into a slurry of very \ufb01ne grained silica or other refractory (almost in powder form) mixed with plaster to bond the mold into shape. The small grain size of the refractory material provides a smooth surface and captures the intricate details of the wax pattern. The \ufb01nal mold (step 4) is accomplished by repeatedly dipping the tree into the refractory slurry or by gently packing the refractory around the tree in a container. The mold is allowed to air dry for about 8 hours to harden the binder. \rAdvantages of investment casting include: (1) parts of great complexity and intricacy can be cast; (2) close dimensional control\u2014tolerances of 0.075 mm (0.003 in) are possible; (3) good surface \ufb01nish is possible; (4) the wax can usually be recovered for reuse; and (5) additional machining is not normally required\u2014 this is a net shape process. Because many steps are involved in this casting operation, it is a relatively expensive process. Investment castings are normally small in size, although parts with complex geometries weighing up to 75 lb have been successfully cast. All types of metals, including steels, stainless steels, and other high temperature alloys, can be investment cast. Examples of parts include complex machinery parts, blades, and other components for turbine engines, jewelry, and dental \ufb01xtures.

The \ufb02uid consistency permits the plaster mixture to readily \ufb02ow around the pattern,capturing its details and surface \ufb01nish.Thus,the cast product in plaster molding is noted for these attributes. \rCuring of the plaster mold is one of the disadvantages of this process, at least in high production. The mold must set for about 20 minutes before the pattern is stripped. The mold is then baked for several hours to remove moisture. Even with the baking,not all of the moisture content is removed from the plaster.The dilemma faced by foundrymen is that mold strength is lost when the plaster becomes too dehydrated, and yet moisture content can cause casting defects in the product. A balance must be achieved between these undesirable alternatives. Another disadvantage with the plaster mold is that it is not permeable, thus limiting escape of gases from the mold cavity. This problem can be solved in a number of ways: \r(1) evacuating air from the mold cavity before pouring; (2) aerating the plaster slurry prior to mold making so that the resulting hard plaster contains \ufb01 nely dispersed voids; and (3) using a special mold composition and treatment known as the Antioch process. This process involves using about 50% sand mixed with the plaster, heating the mold in an autoclave (an oven that uses superheated steam under pressure), and then drying. The resulting mold has considerably greater permeability than a conventional plaster mold. \rPlaster molds cannot withstand the same high temperatures as sand molds. They are therefore limited to the casting of lower-melting-point alloys, such as aluminum, magnesium, and some copper-base alloys. Applications include metal molds for plastic and rubber molding, pump and turbine impellers, and other parts of relatively intricate geometry. Casting sizes range from about 20 g (less than 1 oz) to more than 100 kg (more than 200 lb). Parts weighing less than about 10 kg (20 lb) are most common. Advantages of plaster molding for these applications are good surface \ufb01nish and dimensional accuracy and the capability to make thin cross sections in the casting. \rCeramic-mold casting is similar to plaster-mold casting, except that the mold is made of refractory ceramic materials that can withstand higher temperatures than plaster. Thus, ceramic molding can be used to cast steels, cast irons, and other high-temperature alloys. Its applications (relatively intricate parts) are similar to those of plaster mold casting except for the metals cast. Its advantages (good accuracy and \ufb01nish) are also similar. \r\r\r\rPermanent-Mold Casting Processes \rThe economic disadvantage of any of the expendable mold processes is that a new mold is required for every casting. In permanent-mold casting, the mold is reused many times. In this section, permanent-mold casting is treated as the basic process in the group of casting processes that all use reusable metal molds. Other members of the group include die casting and centrifugal casting. \r\r11.3.1 THE BASIC PERMANENT-MOLD PROCESS \rPermanent-mold casting uses a metal mold constructed of two sections that are designed for easy, precise opening and closing. These molds are commonly made of steel or cast iron. The cavity, with gating system included, is machined into the two halves to provide accurate dimensions and good surface \ufb01 nish. Metals commonly cast in permanent molds include aluminum, magnesium, copper-base alloys, and cast iron. However, cast iron requires a high pouring temperature, 1250\u00b0C to 1500\u00b0C (2300\u00b0F\u20132700\u00b0F), which takes a heavy toll on mold life. The very high pouring temperatures of steel make permanent molds unsuitable for this metal, unless the mold is made of refractory material. \rCores can be used in permanent molds to form interior surfaces in the cast product. The cores can be made of metal, but either their shape must allow for removal from the casting or they must be mechanically collapsible to permit removal. If withdrawal of a metal core would be dif\ufb01cult or impossible, sand cores can be used, in which case the casting process is often referred to as semipermanent-mold casting. \rSteps in the basic permanent mold casting process are described in Figure 11.11.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 26852, "end_char_idx": 31425, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "724dc64c-c600-45af-8da1-36fe02fd8bce": {"__data__": {"id_": "724dc64c-c600-45af-8da1-36fe02fd8bce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec11.txt", "file_name": "sec11.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76556, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66d3b2df-88c2-4aab-956d-aae525f69c8a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec11.txt", "file_name": "sec11.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76556, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "c5a63969e09d5d8ced98b3a0e13843a65602888baf1df780149a36f6187069e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8663203b-ffdf-42d3-a616-103d8585ccdf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec11.txt", "file_name": "sec11.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76556, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "8621a3c8cf4c93d7859b2e18cd330bcd5629a0467de7add2dcdfcea5e4bd031c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "48a3da1c-24ae-453e-84be-133d1888c8bd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c1fb59ea44541fdd9fb1255303e0cc3292cb5d3255809c229b34ca40aedb83c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Metals commonly cast in permanent molds include aluminum, magnesium, copper-base alloys, and cast iron.

If withdrawal of a metal core would be dif\ufb01cult or impossible, sand cores can be used, in which case the casting process is often referred to as semipermanent-mold casting. \rSteps in the basic permanent mold casting process are described in Figure 11.11. In preparation for casting, the mold is \ufb01rst preheated and one or more coatings are sprayed on the cavity. Preheating facilitates metal \ufb02ow through the gating system and into the cavity. The coatings aid heat dissipation and lubricate the mold surfaces for easier separation of the cast product. After pouring, as soon as the metal solidi\ufb01es, the mold is opened and the casting is removed. Unlike expendable molds, permanent molds do not collapse, so the mold must be opened before appreciable cooling contraction occurs in order to prevent cracks from developing in the casting. \r\rAdvantages of permanent-mold casting include good surface \ufb01 nish and close dimensional control, as previously indicated. In addition, more rapid solidi\ufb01 cation caused by the metal mold results in a \ufb01ner grain structure, so stronger castings are produced. The process is generally limited to metals of lower melting points. Other limitations include simple part geometries compared to sand casting (because of the need to open the mold), and the expense of the mold. Because mold cost is substantial, the process is best suited to high-volume production and can be automated accordingly.Typical parts include automotive pistons,pump bodies,and certain castings for aircraft and missiles. \r\r\r11.3.2 VARIATIONS OF PERMANENT-MOLD CASTING \rSeveral casting processes are quite similar to the basic permanent-mold method.These include slush casting, low-pressure casting, and vacuum permanent-mold casting. \rSlush Casting Slush casting is a permanent mold process in which a hollow casting is formed by inverting the mold after partial freezing at the surface to drain out the liquid metal in the center. Solidi\ufb01cation begins at the mold walls because they are relatively cool, and it progresses over time toward the middle of the casting (Section 10.3.1). Thickness of the shell is controlled by the length of time allowed before draining. Slush casting is used to make statues, lamp pedestals, and toys out of low-melting-point metals such as zinc and tin. In these items, the exterior appearance is important, but the strength and interior geometry of the casting are minor considerations. \rLow-Pressure Casting In the basic permanent mold casting process and in slush casting, the \ufb02ow of metal into the mold cavity is caused by gravity. In low-pressure casting,the liquid metal is forced into the cavity under low pressure\u2014approximately \r0.1 MPa (15 lb/in2)\u2014from beneath so that the \ufb02ow is upward, as illustrated in Figure 11.12. The advantage of this approach over traditional pouring is that clean molten metal from the center of the ladle is introduced into the mold, rather than metal that has been exposed to air. Gas porosity and oxidation defects are thereby minimized, and mechanical properties are improved. \rVacuum Permanent-Mold Casting Not to be confused with vacuum molding (Section 11.2.2), this process is a variation of low-pressure casting in which a vacuum is used to draw the molten metal into the mold cavity. The general con\ufb01guration of the vacuum permanent-mold casting process is similar to the low-pressure casting operation. The difference is that reduced air pressure from the vacuum in the mold is used to draw the liquid metal into the cavity, rather than forcing it by positive air pressure from below. There are several bene\ufb01ts of the vacuum technique relative to low-pressure casting: air porosity and related defects are reduced, and greater strength is given to the cast product. \r\r\rFIGURE 11.12 Low-pressure casting.

Typical pressures are 7 to 350 MPa (1000\u201350,000 lb/in2).The pressure is maintained during solidi\ufb01cation,after which the mold is opened and the part is removed. Molds in this casting operation are called dies;hence the name die casting.The use of high pressure to force the metal into the die cavity is the most notable feature that distinguishes this process from others in the permanent mold category. \rDie-casting operations are carried out in special die-casting machines (Historical Note 11.2), which are designed to hold and accurately close the two halves of the mold,and keep them closed while the liquid metal is forced into the cavity.The general con\ufb01guration is shown in Figure 11.13. There are two main types of die-casting machines: (1) hot-chamber and (2) cold-chamber, differentiated by how the molten metal is injected into the cavity. \rHistorical Note 11.2 Die-casting machines \rThe modern die-casting machine has its origins in the printing industry and the need in the mid- to late 1800s to satisfy an increasingly literate population with a growing appetite for reading. The linotype, invented and developed by O. Mergenthaler in the late 1800s, is a machine that produces printing type. It is a casting machine because it casts a line of type characters out of lead to be used in preparing printing plates. The name linotype derives from the fact that the machine produces a line of type characters during each cycle of operation. The machine was \ufb01rst used successfully on a commercial basis in New York City by The Tribune in 1886. \rThe linotype proved the feasibility of mechanized casting machines. The \ufb01rst die-casting machine was patented by H. Doehler in 1905 (this machine is displayed in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C.). In 1907, \rE. Wagner developed the \ufb01rst die-casting machine to utilize the hot-chamber design. It was \ufb01rst used during World War I to cast parts for binoculars and gas masks. \r\r\r(1)\r with die closed and plunger withdrawn,molten metal \ufb02ows into the chamber; \r\r(2)\r plunger forces metalin chamber to \ufb02ow into die, maintainingpressure during coolingand solidi\ufb01cation; and (3) plunger iswithdrawn, die is opened, and solidi\ufb01ed part is ejected.

(Gating system is simpli\ufb01 ed.) \r\rIn cold-chamber die-casting machines, molten metal is poured into an unheated chamber from an external melting container, and a piston is used to inject the metal under high pressure into the die cavity. Injection pressures used in these machines are typically 14 to 140 MPa (2000\u201320,000 lb/in2). The production cycle is explained in Figure 11.15. Compared to hot-chamber machines, cycle rates are not usually as fast because of the need to ladle the liquid metal into the chamber from an external source. Nevertheless,this casting process is a high production operation. Cold-chamber machines are typically used for casting aluminum, brass, and magnesium alloys. Low-melting-point alloys (zinc, tin, lead) can also be cast on cold-chamber machines, but the advantages of the hot-chamber process usually favor its use on these metals. A large die casting produced by a cold-chamber machine is shown in Figure 11.16. \rMolds used in die-casting operations are usually made of tool steel, mold steel, or maraging steel.Tungsten and molybdenum with good refractory qualities are also being used, especially in attempts to die cast steel and cast iron. Dies can be single-cavity or multiple-cavity. Single-cavity dies are shown in Figures 11.14 and 11.15. Ejector pins are required to remove the part from the die when it opens, as shown in the diagrams. These pins push the part away from the mold surface so that it can be removed. Lubricants must also be sprayed into the cavities to prevent sticking. \rBecause the die materials have no natural porosity and the molten metal rapidly \ufb02ows into the die during injection, venting holes and passageways must be built into the dies at the parting line to evacuate the air and gases in the cavity. The vents are quite small; yet they \ufb01ll with metal during injection. This metal must later be trimmed from the part. Also, formation of \ufb02 ash is common in die casting, in which the liquid metal under high pressure squeezes into the small space between the die halves at the parting line or into the clearances around the cores and ejector pins. This \ufb02ash must be trimmed from the casting, along with the sprue and gating system. \rAdvantages of die casting include (1) high production rates possible; (2) economical for large production quantities; (3) close tolerances possible, on the order \rFIGURE 11.16 A large die casting measuring about 400 mm diagonally for a truck cab \ufb02oor.

Squeeze casting is a combination of casting and forging (Section 18.3) in which a molten metal is poured into a preheated lower die, and the upper die is closed to create the mold cavity after solidi\ufb01cation begins. This differs from the usual permanent-mold casting process in which the die halves are closed prior to pouring or injection. Owing to the hybrid nature of the process, it is also known as liquid\u2013metal forging. The pressure applied by the upper die in squeeze casting causes the metal to completely \ufb01ll the cavity, resulting in good surface \ufb01nish and low shrinkage. The required pressures are signi\ufb01cantly less than in forging of a solid metal billet and much \ufb01ner surface detail can be imparted by the die than in forging. Squeeze casting can be used for both ferrous and non-ferrous alloys, but aluminum and magnesium alloys are the most common due to their lower melting temperatures. Automotive parts are a common application. \r\rSemi-solid metal casting is a family of net-shape and near net-shape processes performed on metal alloys at temperatures between the liquidus and solidus (Section 10.3.1). Thus the alloy is a mixture of solid and molten metals during casting, like a slurry; it is in the mushy state. In order to \ufb02ow properly, the mixture must consist of solid metal globules in a liquid rather than the more typical dendritic solid shapes that form during freezing of a molten metal. This is achieved by forcefully stirring the slurry to prevent dendrite formation and instead encourage the spherical shapes, which in turn reduces the viscosity of the work metal. Advantages of semi-solid metal casting include the following [16]: (1) complex part geometries, \r(2) thin walls in parts, (3) close tolerances, (4) zero or low porosity, resulting in high strength of the casting. \rThere are several forms of semi-solid metal casting. When applied to aluminum, the terms thixocasting and rheocasting are used.The pre\ufb01x in thixocasting is derived from the word thixotropy, which refers to the decrease in viscosity of some \ufb02uid-like materials when agitated. The pre\ufb01x in rheocasting comes from rheology, the science that relates deformation and \ufb02ow of materials. In thixocasting, the starting work material is a pre-cast billet that has a non-dendritic microstructure; this is heated into the semi-solid temperature range and injected into a mold cavity using die casting equipment. In rheocasting, a semi-solid slurry is injected into the mold cavity by a die casting machine,very much like conventional die casting.The difference is that the starting metal in rheocasting is at a temperature between the solidus and liquidus rather than above the liquidus. And the mushy mixture is agitated to prevent dendrite formation. \rWhen applied to magnesium, the term is thixomolding, which utilizes equipment similar to an injection-molding machine (Section 13.6.3). Magnesium alloy granules are fed into a barrel and propelled forward by a rotating screw as they are heated into the semi-solid temperature range.The required globular form of the solid phase is accomplished by the mixing action of the rotating screw.The slurry is then injected into the mold cavity by a linear forward movement of the screw. \r\r11.3.5 CENTRIFUGAL CASTING \rCentrifugal casting refers to several casting methods in which the mold is rotated at high speed so that centrifugal force distributes the molten metal to the outer regions of the die cavity.

The group includes (1) true centrifugal casting, (2) semicentrifugal casting, and (3) centrifuge casting. \rTrue Centrifugal Casting In true centrifugal casting, molten metal is poured into a rotating mold to produce a tubular part. Examples of parts made by this process include pipes, tubes, bushings, and rings. One possible setup is illustrated in Figure 11.17. Molten metal is poured into a horizontal rotating mold at one end. In some operations, mold rotation commences after pouring has occurred rather than beforehand. The high-speed rotation results in centrifugal forces that cause the metal to take the shape of the mold cavity. Thus, the outside shape of the casting can be round, octagonal, hexagonal, and so on. However, the inside shape of the casting is (theoretically) perfectly round, due to the radially symmetric forces at work. \rOrientation of the axis of mold rotation can be either horizontal or vertical, the former being more common. The question is, how fast must the mold be rotated for the process to work successfully? Consider horizontal centrifugal casting \ufb01rst. Centrifugal force is de\ufb01ned by this physics equation: \r\r\rF ! mv2 \r(11.2)\rR \rwhere F ! force, N (lb); m ! mass, kg (lbm); v ! velocity, m/s (ft/sec); and R ! inside radius of the mold, m (ft). The force of gravity is its weight W ! mg, where W is given in kg (lb), and g ! acceleration of gravity, 9.8 m/s2 (32.2 ft/sec2). The so-called G-factor GF is the ratio of centrifugal force divided by weight: \rF mv2 v2 \rGF ! ! (11.3)\rW Rmg Rg Velocity v can be expressed as 2pRN/60 ! pRN/30, where the constant 60 converts seconds to minutes; so that N ! rotational speed, rev/min. Substituting this expression into Equation (11.3), \rpRN 2 pN 2\r\r\r\r() R()\r30 30\rGF ! (11.4)\rg\rRg Rearranging this to solve for rotational speed N, and using diameter D rather than radius in the resulting equation, 30 gGF 30 2gGF\r\rN ! (11.5)\rp ! R p ! D where D ! inside diameter of the mold, m (ft). If the G-factor is too low in centrifugal casting, the liquid metal will not remain forced against the mold wall during the upper half of the circular path but will \u201crain\u201d inside the cavity. Slipping occurs between the molten metal and the mold wall, which means that the rotational speed of the metal is less than that of the mold. On an empirical basis, values of GF ! 60 to 80 are found to be appropriate for horizontal centrifugal casting [2], although this depends to some extent on the metal being cast. \rA true centrifugal casting operation is to be performed horizontally to make copper tube sections with OD  25 cm and ID  22.5 cm.

Equation (11.6) can be used to determine the required rotational speed for vertical centrifugal casting, given speci\ufb01 cations on the inside radii at top and bottom. One can see from the formula that for Rt to equal Rb, the speed of rotation N would have to be in\ufb01nite, which is impossible of course. As a practical matter, part lengths made by vertical centrifugal casting are usually no more than about twice their diameters. This is quite satisfactory for bushings and other parts that have large diameters relatively to their lengths, especially if machining will be used to accurately size the inside diameter. \rCastings made by true centrifugal casting are characterized by high density, especially in the outer regions of the part where F is greatest. Solidi\ufb01 cation shrinkage at the exterior of the cast tube is not a factor, because the centrifugal force continually reallocates molten metal toward the mold wall during freezing.Any impurities in the casting tend to be on the inner wall and can be removed by machining if necessary. \rSemicentrifugal Casting In this method, centrifugal force is used to produce solid castings, as in Figure 11.18, rather than tubular parts. The rotation speed in semicentrifugal casting is usually set so that G-factors of around 15 are obtained [2], and the molds are designed with risers at the center to supply feed metal. Density of metal in the \ufb01nal casting is greater in the outer sections than at the center of rota-tion.The process is often used on parts in which the center of the casting is machined away, thus eliminating the portion of the casting where the quality is lowest. Wheels and pulleys are examples of castings that can be made by this process.

Heating and melting are accomplished in a furnace. This section covers the various types of furnaces used in foundries and the pouring practices for delivering the molten metal from furnace to mold. \r\r11.4.1 FURNACES \rThe types of furnaces most commonly used in foundries are (1) cupolas, (2) direct fuel-\ufb01red furnaces, (3) crucible furnaces, (4) electric-arc furnaces, and (5) induction furnaces. Selection of the most appropriate furnace type depends on factors such as the casting alloy; its melting and pouring temperatures; capacity requirements of the furnace; costs of investment, operation, and maintenance; and environmental pollution considerations. \rCupolas A cupola is a vertical cylindrical furnace equipped with a tapping spout near its base. Cupolas are used only for melting cast irons, and although other furnaces are also used, the largest tonnage of cast iron is melted in cupolas. General construction and operating features of the cupola are illustrated in Figure 11.20. It consists of a large shell of steel plate lined with refractory. The \u201ccharge,\u201d consisting of iron, coke, \ufb02 ux, and possible alloying elements, is loaded through a charging door located less than halfway up the height of the cupola. The iron is usually a mixture of pig iron and scrap (including risers, runners, and sprues left over from previous castings). Coke is the fuel used to heat the furnace. Forced air is introduced through openings near the bottom of the shell for combustion of the coke. The \ufb02ux is a basic \r\r\rFIGURE 11.20 Cupolaused for melting castiron. Furnace shown is typical for a smallfoundry and omitsdetails of emissions control system requiredin a modern cupola. \rcompound such as limestone that reacts with coke ash and other impurities to form slag. The slag serves to cover the melt, protecting it from reaction with the environment inside the cupola and reducing heat loss. As the mixture is heated and melting of the iron occurs, the furnace is periodically tapped to provide liquid metal for the pour. \rDirect Fuel-Fired Furnaces A direct fuel-\ufb01red furnace contains a small open hearth, in which the metal charge is heated by fuel burners located on the side of the furnace.The roof of the furnace assists the heating action by re\ufb02ecting the \ufb02ame down against the charge. Typical fuel is natural gas, and the combustion products exit the furnace through a stack. At the bottom of the hearth is a tap hole to release the molten metal. Direct fuel-\ufb01red furnaces are generally used in casting for melting nonferrous metals such as copper-base alloys and aluminum. \rCrucible Furnaces These furnaces melt the metal without direct contact with a burning fuel mixture. For this reason, they are sometimes called indirect fuel-\ufb01red furnaces. Three types of crucible furnaces are used in foundries: (a) lift-out type, (b) stationary, and (c) tilting, illustrated in Figure 11.21. They all utilize a container (the crucible) made out of a suitable refractory material (e.g., a clay\u2013graphite mixture) or high-temperature steel alloy to hold the charge. In the lift-out crucible furnace, the crucible is placed in a furnace and heated suf\ufb01ciently to melt the metal charge. Oil, gas, or powdered coal are typical fuels for these furnaces. When the metal is melted, the crucible is lifted out of the furnace and used as a pouring ladle. The other two types, sometimes referred to as pot furnaces, have the heating furnace and container as one integral unit. In the stationary pot furnace, the furnace is stationary and the molten metal is ladled out of the container. In the tilting-pot furnace, the entire assembly can be tilted for pouring. Crucible furnaces are used for nonferrous metals such as bronze, brass, and alloys of zinc and aluminum. Furnace capacities are generally limited to several hundred pounds. \r\rElectric-Arc Furnaces In this furnace type, the charge is melted by heat generated from an electric arc.

Crucible furnaces are used for nonferrous metals such as bronze, brass, and alloys of zinc and aluminum. Furnace capacities are generally limited to several hundred pounds. \r\rElectric-Arc Furnaces In this furnace type, the charge is melted by heat generated from an electric arc. Various con\ufb01gurations are available, with two or three electrodes (Figure 6.9). Power consumption is high, but electric-arc furnaces can be designed for high melting capacity (23,000\u201345,000 kg/hr or 25\u201350 tons/hr), and they are used primarily for casting steel. \rInduction Furnaces An induction furnace uses alternating current passing through a coil to develop a magnetic \ufb01eld in the metal, and the resulting induced current causes rapid heating and melting of the metal. Features of an induction furnace for foundry operations are illustrated in Figure 11.22. The electromagnetic force \ufb01eld causes a mixing action to occur in the liquid metal. Also, since the metal does not come in direct contact with the heating elements, the environment in which melting takes place can be closely controlled. All of this results in molten metals of high quality and purity, and induction furnaces are used for nearly any casting alloy when these requirements are important. Melting steel, cast iron, and aluminum alloys are common applications in foundry work. \r\r\r\r11.4.2 POURING, CLEANING, AND HEAT TREATMENT \rMoving the molten metal from the melting furnace to the mold is sometimes done using crucibles. More often, the transfer is accomplished by ladles of various kinds. These ladles receive the metal from the furnace and allow for convenient pouring into the molds. Two common ladles are illustrated in Figure 11.23, one for handling large volumes of molten metal using an overhead crane, and the other a \u201ctwo-man ladle\u201d for manually moving and pouring smaller amounts. \rOne of the problems in pouring is that oxidized molten metal can be introduced into the mold. Metal oxides reduce product quality, perhaps rendering the casting defective, so measures are taken to minimize the entry of these oxides into the mold during pouring. Filters are sometimes used to catch the oxides and other impurities as the metal is poured from the spout, and \ufb02uxes are used to cover the molten metal to retard oxidation. In addition, ladles have been devised to pour the liquid metal from the bottom, since the top surface is where the oxides accumulate. \rAfter the casting has solidi\ufb01ed and been removed from the mold, a number of additional steps are usually required. These operations include (1) trimming, (2) removing the core, (3) surface cleaning, (4) inspection, (5) repair, if required, and \r(6) heat treatment. Steps (1) through (5) are collectively referred to in foundry work as \u201ccleaning.\u201d The extent to which these additional operations are required varies with casting processes and metals. When required, they are usually labor-intensive and costly. \rTrimming involves removal of sprues, runners, risers, parting-line \ufb02ash, \ufb01ns, chaplets, and any other excess metal from the cast part. In the case of brittle casting alloys and when the cross sections are relatively small, these appendages on the casting can be broken off. Otherwise, hammering, shearing, hack-sawing, band-sawing, abrasive wheel cutting, or various torch cutting methods are used. \r\r\rIf cores have been used to cast the part, they must be removed. Most cores are chemically bonded or oil-bonded sand, and they often fall out of the casting as the binder deteriorates. In some cases, they are removed by shaking the casting, either manually or mechanically. In rare instances, cores are removed by chemically dissolving the bonding agent used in the sand core. Solid cores must be hammered or pressed out. \rSurface cleaning is most important in the case of sand casting. In many of the other casting methods, especially the permanent mold processes, this step can be avoided.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 54052, "end_char_idx": 58441, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a89712e-66bc-4ad2-901d-3fb7c8f8cb71": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a89712e-66bc-4ad2-901d-3fb7c8f8cb71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec11.txt", "file_name": "sec11.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76556, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66d3b2df-88c2-4aab-956d-aae525f69c8a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec11.txt", "file_name": "sec11.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76556, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "c5a63969e09d5d8ced98b3a0e13843a65602888baf1df780149a36f6187069e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "665b3d29-ba69-4738-8ad4-d95bb7597312", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec11.txt", "file_name": "sec11.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76556, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "1bd8ec493db17a8a8f05cea52720bfabd80511b970fe8704f5a3130b6351d526", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cea2a839-2c7c-47ef-aa06-a90e13dad30d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7041922735cb3a4211a5d069578d3357bedfb24a4dc170c79665f05d3dd7b58c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In the case of brittle casting alloys and when the cross sections are relatively small, these appendages on the casting can be broken off.

In many of the other casting methods, especially the permanent mold processes, this step can be avoided. Surface cleaning involves removal of sand from the surface of the casting and otherwise enhancing the appearance of the surface. Methods used to clean the surface include tumbling, air-blasting with coarse sand grit or metal shot, wire brushing, and chemical pickling (Section 27.1). \rDefects are possible in casting, and inspection is needed to detect their presence. These quality issues are considered in the following section. \rCastings are often heat treated to enhance their properties, either for subsequent \rprocessing operations such as machining or to bring out the desired properties for \rapplication of the part. \r\r\r\r\rCasting Quality \rThere are numerous opportunities for things to go wrong in a casting operation, resulting in quality defects in the cast product. In this section, the common defects that occur in casting are listed, and the inspection procedures to detect them are indicated. \rCasting Defects Some defects are common to any and all casting processes. These defects are illustrated in Figure 11.24 and brie\ufb02y described in the following: \r(a) \rMisruns, which are castings that solidify before completely \ufb01lling the mold cavity. Typical causes include (1) \ufb02uidity of the molten metal is insuf\ufb01cient, (2) pouring temperature is too low, (3) pouring is done too slowly, and/or (4) cross section of the mold cavity is too thin. \r\r(b) \rCold Shuts, which occur when two portions of the metal \ufb02ow together but there is a lack of fusion between them due to premature freezing. Its causes are similar to those of a misrun. \r\r(c) \rCold shots, which result from splattering during pouring, causing the formation of solid globules of metal that become entrapped in the casting. Pouring procedures and gating system designs that avoid splattering can prevent this defect. \r\r(d) \rShrinkage cavity is a depression in the surface or an internal void in the casting, caused by solidi\ufb01cation shrinkage that restricts the amount of molten metal available in the last region to freeze. It often occurs near the top of the casting, in which case it is referred to as a \u201cpipe.\u201d See Figure 10.8(3). The problem can often be solved by proper riser design. \r\r(e) \rMicroporosity consists of a network of small voids distributed throughout the casting caused by localized solidi\ufb01cation shrinkage of the \ufb01nal molten metal in the dendritic structure. The defect is usually associated with alloys, because of the protracted manner in which freezing occurs in these metals. \r\r\r\r(b) cold shut, (c) cold shot, (d) shrinkage cavity, (e) microporosity, and (f) hot tearing. \rFIGURE 11.25 \rCommon defects in sand castings: (a) sandblow, (b) pin holes, (c) sand wash, (d) scabs,\r(e)\r penetration, (f) moldshift, (g) core shift, and\r\r(h)\r mold crack. \r\r\r\r(f) Hot tearing, also called hot cracking, occurs when the casting is restrained from contraction by an unyielding mold during the \ufb01nal stages of solidi\ufb01cation or early stages of cooling after solidi\ufb01cation.

The defect is manifested as a separation of the metal (hence, the terms tearing and cracking) at a point of high tensile stress caused by the metal\u2019s inability to shrink naturally. In sand casting and other expendable-mold processes, it is prevented by compounding the mold to be collapsible. In permanent-mold processes, hot tearing is reduced by removing the part from the mold immediately after solidi\ufb01cation. \rSome defects are related to the use of sand molds, and therefore they occur only in sand castings. To a lesser degree, other expendable mold processes are also susceptible to these problems. Defects found primarily in sand castings are shown in Figure 11.25 and described here: \r\r\r(a) \rSand blow is a defect consisting of a balloon-shaped gas cavity caused by release of mold gases during pouring. It occurs at or below the casting surface near the top of the casting. Low permeability, poor venting, and high moisture content of the sand mold are the usual causes. \r\r(b) \rPinholes, also caused by release of gases during pouring, consist of many small gas cavities formed at or slightly below the surface of the casting. \r\r(c) \rSand wash, which is an irregularity in the surface of the casting that results from erosion of the sand mold during pouring, and the contour of the erosion is formed in the surface of the \ufb01nal cast part. \r\r(d) \rScabs are rough areas on the surface of the casting due to encrustations of sand and metal. It is caused by portions of the mold surface \ufb02aking off during solidi\ufb01cation and becoming imbedded in the casting surface. \r\r(e) \rPenetration refers to a surface defect that occurs when the \ufb02uidity of the liquid metal is high, and it penetrates into the sand mold or sand core. Upon freezing, the casting surface consists of a mixture of sand grains and metal. Harder packing of the sand mold helps to alleviate this condition. \r\r(f) \rMold shift refers to a defect caused by a sidewise displacement of the mold cope relative to the drag, the result of which is a step in the cast product at the parting line. \r\r(g) \rCore shift is similar to mold shift, but it is the core that is displaced, and the displacement is usually vertical.

Alloys are generally easier to cast, and properties of the resulting product are better. Casting alloys can be classi\ufb01ed as ferrous or nonferrous. The ferrous category is subdivided into cast iron and cast steel. \rFerrous Casting Alloys: Cast Iron Cast iron is the most important of all casting alloys (Historical Note 11.3). The tonnage of cast iron castings is several times \r\rthat of all other metals combined. There are several types of cast iron: (1) gray cast iron, (2) nodular iron, (3) white cast iron, (4) malleable iron, and (5) alloy cast irons (Section 6.2.4).Typical pouring temperatures for cast iron are around 1400\u00b0C (2500\u00b0F), depending on composition. \rHistorical Note 11.3 Early cast iron products \rIn the early centuries of casting, bronze and brass were preferred over cast iron as foundry metals. Iron was more dif\ufb01cult to cast, due to its higher melting temperatures and lack of knowledge about its metallurgy. Also, there was little demand for cast iron products. This all changed starting in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. \rThe art of sand casting iron entered Europe from China, where iron was cast in sand molds more than 2,500 years ago. In 1550 the \ufb01rst cannons were cast from iron in Europe. Cannon balls for these guns were made of cast iron starting around 1568. Guns and their projectiles created a large demand for cast iron. But these items were for military rather than civilian use. Two cast iron products that became signi\ufb01cant to the general public in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were the cast iron stove and cast iron water pipe. \rAs unspectacular a product as it may seem today, the cast iron stove brought comfort, health, and improved living conditions to many people in Europe and America. During the 1700s, the manufacture of cast iron stoves was one of the largest and most profitable industries on these two continents. The commercial success of stove making was due to the large demand for the product and the art and technology of casting iron that had been developed to produce it. \rCast iron water pipe was another product that spurred the growth of the iron casting industry. Until the advent of cast iron pipes, a variety of methods had been tried to supply water directly to homes and shops, including hollow wooden pipes (which quickly rotted), lead pipes (too expensive), and open trenches (susceptible to pollution). Development of the iron-casting process provided the capability to fabricate water pipe sections at relatively low cost. Cast iron water pipes were used in France starting in 1664, and later in other parts of Europe. By the early 1800s, cast iron pipe lines were being widely installed in England for water and gas delivery. The \ufb01 rst signi\ufb01cant water pipe installation in the United States was in Philadelphia in 1817, using pipe imported from England. \r\rFerrous Casting Alloys: Steel The mechanical properties of steel make it an attractive engineering material, and the capability to create complex geometries makes casting an appealing process. However, great dif\ufb01culties are faced by the foundry specializing in steel. First, the melting point of steel is considerably higher than for most other metals that are commonly cast. The solidi\ufb01cation range for low carbon steels (Figure 6.4) begins at just under 1540\u00b0C (2800\u00b0F). This means that the pouring temperature required for steel is very high\u2014about 1650\u00b0C (3000\u00b0F). At these high temperatures, steel is chemically very reactive. It readily oxidizes, so special procedures must be used during melting and pouring to isolate the molten metal from air. Also, molten steel has relatively poor \ufb02uidity, and this limits the design of thin sections in components cast out of steel.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 64163, "end_char_idx": 68498, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40eef0af-de90-4631-8bb0-ba4cf9139664": {"__data__": {"id_": "40eef0af-de90-4631-8bb0-ba4cf9139664", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec11.txt", "file_name": "sec11.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76556, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66d3b2df-88c2-4aab-956d-aae525f69c8a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec11.txt", "file_name": "sec11.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76556, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "c5a63969e09d5d8ced98b3a0e13843a65602888baf1df780149a36f6187069e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c57911e0-03b5-41d8-83e7-c8b7fba5f9ba", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec11.txt", "file_name": "sec11.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76556, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "842defef19097d6541e78ddeacaa4eea0687a177fbe32146fc0e5395cc59469e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "866da4be-4800-4a16-912e-30303bdad9ce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "332c71bd293a76438beaf4fee6affefb204d694ae36b81508c27cbebc8e98199", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "However, great dif\ufb01culties are faced by the foundry specializing in steel.

It readily oxidizes, so special procedures must be used during melting and pouring to isolate the molten metal from air. Also, molten steel has relatively poor \ufb02uidity, and this limits the design of thin sections in components cast out of steel. \rSeveral characteristics of steel castings make it worth the effort to solve these problems. Tensile strength is higher than for most other casting metals, ranging upward from about 410 MPa (60,000 lb/in2) [9]. Steel castings have better toughness than most other casting alloys.The properties of steel castings are isotropic;strength is virtually the same in all directions. By contrast, mechanically formed parts (e.g., rolling, forging) exhibit directionality in their properties. Depending on the requirements of the product, isotropic behavior of the material may be desirable. Another advantage of steel castings is ease of welding. They can be readily welded without signi\ufb01cant loss of strength, to repair the casting, or to fabricate structures with other steel components. \r\rNonferrous Casting Alloys Nonferrous casting metals include alloys of aluminum, magnesium, copper, tin, zinc, nickel, and titanium (Section 6.3). Aluminum alloys are generally considered to be very castable. The melting point of pure aluminum is 660\u00b0C (1220\u00b0F), so pouring temperatures for aluminum casting alloys are low compared to cast iron and steel. Their properties make them attractive for castings: light weight, wide range of strength properties attainable through heat treatment, and ease of machining. Magnesium alloys are the lightest of all casting metals. Other properties include corrosion resistance, as well as high strength-to-weight and stiffness-toweight ratios. \rCopper alloys include bronze, brass, and aluminum bronze. Properties that make them attractive include corrosion resistance, attractive appearance, and good bearing qualities. The high cost of copper is a limitation on the use of its alloys. Applications include pipe \ufb01 ttings, marine propeller blades, pump components, and ornamental jewelry. \rTin has the lowest melting point of the casting metals. Tin-based alloys are generally easy to cast. They have good corrosion resistant but poor mechanical strength, which limits their applications to pewter mugs and similar products not requiring high strength. Zinc alloys are commonly used in die casting. Zinc has a low melting point and good \ufb02uidity, making it highly castable. Its major weakness is low creep strength, so its castings cannot be subjected to prolonged high stresses. \rNickel alloys have good hot strength and corrosion resistance, which make them suited to high-temperature applications such as jet engine and rocket components, heat shields, and similar components. Nickel alloys also have a high melting point and are not easy to cast. Titanium alloys for casting are corrosion resistant and possess high strength-to-weight ratios. However, titanium has a high melting point, low \ufb02uidity, and a propensity to oxidize at high temperatures. These properties make it and its alloys dif\ufb01cult to cast. \r\r\rProduct Design Considerations \rIf casting is selected by the product designer as the primary manufacturing process for a particular component, then certain guidelines should be followed to facilitate production of the part and avoid many of the defects enumerated in Section 11.5. Some of the important guidelines and considerations for casting are presented here. \r\u27a2 \rGeometric simplicity. Although casting is a process that can be used to produce complex part geometries, simplifying the part design will improve its castability. Avoiding unnecessary complexities simpli\ufb01es mold making, reduces the need for cores, and improves the strength of the casting. \r\r\u27a2 \rCorners. Sharp corners and angles should be avoided, because they are sources of stress concentrations and may cause hot tearing and cracks in the casting. Generous \ufb01llets should be designed on inside corners, and sharp edges should be blended. \r\r\r\r\r\rFIGURE 11.26 (a) Thick section at intersection can result in a shrinkage cavity.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 67815, "end_char_idx": 72331, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "866da4be-4800-4a16-912e-30303bdad9ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "866da4be-4800-4a16-912e-30303bdad9ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec11.txt", "file_name": "sec11.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76556, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66d3b2df-88c2-4aab-956d-aae525f69c8a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec11.txt", "file_name": "sec11.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76556, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "c5a63969e09d5d8ced98b3a0e13843a65602888baf1df780149a36f6187069e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "40eef0af-de90-4631-8bb0-ba4cf9139664", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec11.txt", "file_name": "sec11.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 76556, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "dd1001a3d55bb2b6771ab5810d5476d6e174fee45f047e9931409c3f306ffad0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "449e143a-9e05-4518-a4aa-6eab73bc3c8f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "73ac88e2fdeaca0928c2c4f7245157000f0a406a6341c4955fac4350759e03ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Some of the important guidelines and considerations for casting are presented here. \r\u27a2 \rGeometric simplicity.

Remedies include (b) redesign to reduce thickness and (c) use of a core. \r\u27a2 \rSection thicknesses. Section thicknesses should be uniform in order to avoid shrinkage cavities. Thicker sections create hot spots in the casting, because greater volume requires more time for solidi\ufb01cation and cooling. These are likely locations of shrinkage cavities. Figure 11.26 illustrates the problem and offers some possible solutions. \r\r\u27a2 \rDraft. Part sections that project into the mold should have a draft or taper, as de\ufb01ned in Figure 11.27. In expendable mold casting, the purpose of this draft is to facilitate removal of the pattern from the mold. In permanent mold casting, its purpose is to aid in removal of the part from the mold. Similar tapers should be allowed if solid cores are used in the casting process. The required draft need only be about 1\u00b0 for sand casting and 2\u00b0 to 3\u00b0 for permanent mold processes. \r\r\u27a2 \rUse of cores. Minor changes in part design can reduce the need for coring, as shown in Figure 11.27. \r\r\u27a2 \rDimensional tolerances. There are signi\ufb01cant differences in the dimensional accuracies that can be achieved in castings, depending on which process is used. Table 11.2 provides a compilation of typical part tolerances for various casting processes and metals. \r\r\u27a2 \rSurface \ufb01 nish.

Similarly poor \ufb01nishes are obtained in shell molding, while plaster-mold and investment casting produce much better roughness values: \r\r0.75 mm (30 m-in). Among the permanent mold processes, die casting is noted for good surface \ufb01nishes at around 1 mm (40 m-in). \r\r\u27a2 \rMachining allowances. Tolerances achievable in many casting processes are insuf\ufb01cient to meet functional needs in many applications. Sand casting is the most prominent example of this de\ufb01ciency. In these cases, portions of the casting must be machined to the required dimensions.

Many are produced in very large quantities, such as light bulbs, beverage bottles, and window glass. Others, such as giant telescope lenses, are made individually. \rGlass is one of three basic types of ceramics (Chapter 7). It is distinguished by its noncrystalline (vitreous) structure, whereas the other ceramic materials have a crystalline structure. The methods by which glass is shaped into useful products are quite different from those used for the other types. In glassworking, the principal starting material is silica (SiO2); this is usually combined with other oxide ceramics that form glasses. The starting material is heated to transform it from a hard solid into a viscous liquid; it is then shaped into the desired geometry while in this highly plastic or \ufb02uid condition. When cooled and hard, the material remains in the glassy state rather than crystallizing. \rThe typical manufacturing sequence in glassworking consists of the steps pictured in Figure 12.1. Shaping is accomplished by various processes, including casting, pressing-and-blowing (to produce bottles and other containers), and rolling (to make plate glass). A \ufb01nishing step is required for certain products. \r\r12.1 Raw Materials Preparation and Melting \rThe main component in nearly all glasses is silica, the primary source of which is natural quartz in sand. The sand must be washed and classi\ufb01ed. Washing removes impurities such as clay and certain minerals that would cause undesirable coloring of the glass. Classifying the sand means grouping the grains according to size. The most desirable particle size for glassmaking is in the range of 0.1 to 0.6 mm (0.004\u20130.025 in) [3]. The various other components, such as soda ash (source of Na2O), limestone (source of CaO), aluminum oxide, potash \r(1) preparation ofraw materials and melting, (2) shaping,and (3) heat treatment. \r\r(source of K2O), and other minerals are added in the proper proportions to achieve the desired composition. The mixing is usually done in batches, in amounts that are compatible with the capacities of available melting furnaces. \rRecycled glass is usually added to the mixture in modern practice. In addition to preserving the environment, recycled glass facilitates melting. Depending on the amount of waste glass available and the speci\ufb01cations of the \ufb01nal composition, the proportion of recycled glass may be up to 100%. \rThe batch of starting materials to be melted is referred to as a charge, and the procedure of loading it into the melting furnace is called charging the furnace. Glass-melting furnaces can be divided into the following types [3]: (1) pot furnaces\u2014 ceramic pots of limited capacity in which melting occurs by heating the walls of the pot; (2) day tanks\u2014larger capacity vessels for batch production in which heating is done by burning fuels above the charge; (3) continuous tank furnaces\u2014long tank furnaces in which raw materials are fed in one end, and melted as they move to the other end where molten glass is drawn out for high production; and (4) electric furnaces of various designs for a wide range of production rates. \rGlass melting is generally carried out at temperatures around 1500\u00b0C to 1600\u00b0C (2700\u00b0F\u20132900\u00b0F). The melting cycle for a typical charge takes 24 to 48 hours. This is the time required for all of the sand grains to become a clear liquid and for the molten glass to be re\ufb01ned and cooled to the appropriate temperature for working. Molten glass is a viscous liquid, the viscosity being inversely related to temperature. Because the shaping operation immediately follows the melting cycle, the temperature at which the glass is tapped from the furnace depends on the viscosity required for the subsequent process.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4150, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a45a673-5290-4b33-949b-7eddbe6ab706": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a45a673-5290-4b33-949b-7eddbe6ab706", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec12.txt", "file_name": "sec12.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19920, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "102f3d5b-6040-4b93-825f-dba69154742c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec12.txt", "file_name": "sec12.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19920, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4a2c983ce0b73707fb14f123435391fb507c4f067d5bfed8a2ef166de2335f72", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "afbf6602-ddff-476c-b1fa-866db8699f5a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec12.txt", "file_name": "sec12.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19920, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "02002a9a3bb550fe5ba0d890774914fd5891e69c9190d072555a3ad812a68da7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "41d4506c-5c26-43b2-97d7-49e269e05968", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca0d65e1e16bbc2ff6b2c76030703e049b76268bc85995a1820de6e8392bc498", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Glass melting is generally carried out at temperatures around 1500\u00b0C to 1600\u00b0C (2700\u00b0F\u20132900\u00b0F).

Despite the variety represented by this list, the shaping processes to fabricate these products can be grouped into only three categories: (1) discrete processes for piece ware, which includes bottles, light bulbs, and other individual items; (2) continuous processes for making \ufb02at glass (sheet and plate glass for windows) and tubing (for laboratory ware and \ufb02uorescent lights); and (3) \ufb01ber-making processes to produce \ufb01bers for insulation, \ufb01berglass composite materials, and \ufb01ber optics. \r12.2.1 SHAPING OF PIECE WARE \rThe ancient methods of hand-working glass, such as glass blowing, were brie\ufb02y described in Historical Note 7.3. Handicraft methods are still employed today for making glassware items of high value in small quantities. Most of the processes \r(1) a gob of glass fedinto mold from the furnace; (2) pressinginto shape by plunger;and (3) plunger isretracted and the \ufb01nished product is  removed. Symbols v and F indicate motion (v ! velocity) and appliedforce, respectively. \rFIGURE 12.2 Spinning offunnel-shaped glass parts:\r(1) gob of glass dropped intomold; and (2) rotation of moldto cause spreading of moltenglass on mold surface. \r\r\rdiscussed in this section are highly mechanized technologies for producing discrete pieces such as jars, bottles, and light bulbs in high quantities. \rSpinning Glass spinning is similar to centrifugal casting of metals, and is also known by that name in glassworking. It is used to produce funnel-shaped components such as the back sections of cathode ray tubes for televisions and computer monitors. The setup is pictured in Figure 12.2. A gob of molten glass is dropped into a conical mold made of steel. The mold is rotated so that centrifugal force causes the glass to \ufb02ow upward and spread itself on the mold surface. The faceplate (i.e., the front viewing screen) is later assembled to the funnel using a sealing glass of low melting point. \rPressing This is a widely used process for mass producing glass pieces such as dishes, bake ware, headlight lenses, TV tube faceplates, and similar items that are relatively \ufb02at.The processis illustrated anddescribedin Figure 12.3.The largequantities of most pressed products justify a high level of automation in this production sequence. \rBlowing Several shaping sequences include blowing as one or more of the steps. Instead of a manual operation, blowing is performed on highly automated equipment. The two sequences described here are the press-and-blow and blow-and-blow methods. \rAs the name indicates, the press-and-blow method is a pressing operation followed by a blowing operation, as portrayed in Figure 12.4. The process is suited to the production of wide-mouth containers.A split mold is used in the blowing operation for part removal. \r\r\rThe blow-and-blow method is used to produce smaller-mouthed bottles.

Press-and-blow and blow-and-blow methods are used to make jars, beverage bottles, incandescent light bulb enclosures, and similar geometries. \rCasting If the molten glass is suf\ufb01ciently \ufb02uid, it can be poured into a mold. Relatively massive objects, such as astronomical lenses and mirrors, are made by this method. These pieces must be cooled very slowly to avoid internal stresses and possible cracking owing to temperature gradients that would otherwise be set up in the glass. After cooling and solidifying, the piece must be \ufb01nished by lapping and polishing. Casting is not much used in glassworking except for these kinds of special jobs. Not only is cooling and cracking a problem, but also molten glass is relatively viscous at normal working temperatures, and does not \ufb02ow through small ori\ufb01ces or into small sections as well as molten metals or heated thermoplastics. Smaller lenses are usually made by pressing, discussed above. \r\r12.2.2 SHAPING OF FLAT AND TUBULAR GLASS \rTwo methods for making plate glass and one method for producing tube stock are described here.They are continuous processes,in which long sections of \ufb02at window glass or glass tubing are made and later cut into appropriate sizes and lengths. They are modern technologies in contrast to the ancient method described in Historical Note 12.1. \rHistorical Note 12.1 Ancient methods of making \ufb02at glass [7] \rGlass windows have been used in buildings for many centuries. The oldest process for making \ufb02 at window glass was by manual glass blowing. The procedure consisted of the following: (1) a glass globe was blown on a blowpipe; (2) a portion of the globe was made to stick to the end of a \u201cpunty,\u201d a metal rod used by glassblowers, and then detached from the blowpipe; and (3) after reheating the glass, the punty was rotated with suf\ufb01cient speed for centrifugal force to shape the open globe into a \ufb02at disk. The disk, whose maximum possible size was only about 1 m (3 ft), was later cut into small panes for windows. \rAt the center of the disk, where the glass was attached to the punty during the third step in the process, a lump would tend to form that had the appearance of a crown. The name \u201ccrown glass\u201d was derived from this resemblance. Lenses for spectacles were ground from glass made by this method. Today, the name crown glass is still used for certain types of optical and ophthalmic glass, even though the ancient method has been replaced by modern production technology. \rRolling of Flat Plate Flat plate glass can be produced by rolling, as illustrated in Figure 12.6. The starting glass, in a suitably plastic condition from the furnace, is squeezed through opposing rolls whose separation determines the thickness of the sheet. The rolling operation is usually set up so that the \ufb02at glass is moved directly into an annealing furnace. The rolled glass sheet must later be ground and polished for parallelism and smoothness. \rFIGURE 12.7 The \ufb02oat process for producingsheet glass. \rFIGURE 12.8 Drawingof glass tubes bythe Danner process.Symbols v and F indicate motion (v ! velocity) and appliedforce, respectively. \r\rFloat Process This process was developed in the late 1950s.

Its advantage over other methods such as rolling is that it obtains smooth surfaces that need no subsequent \ufb01nishing. In the \ufb02 oat process, illustrated in Figure 12.7, the glass \ufb02ows directly from its melting furnace onto the surface of a molten tin bath.The highly \ufb02uid glass spreads evenly across the molten tin surface, achieving a uniform thickness and smoothness. After moving into a cooler region of the bath, the glass hardens and travels through an annealing furnace, after which it is cut to size. \rDrawing of Glass Tubes Glass tubing is manufactured by a drawing process known as the Danner process, illustrated in Figure 12.8.

Glass \ufb01ber products can be divided into two categories [6]: (1) \ufb01brous glass for thermal insulation, acoustical insulation, and air \ufb01ltration, in which the \ufb01bers are in a random, wool-like condition; and (2) long, continuous \ufb01laments suitable for \ufb01ber-reinforced plastics, yarns and fabrics, and \ufb01ber optics. Different production methods are used for the two categories. Two methods are described in the following paragraphs, representing each of the product categories, respectively. \rCentrifugal Spraying In a typical process for making glass wool, molten glass \ufb02ows into a rotating bowl with many small ori\ufb01ces around its periphery. Centrifugal force causes the glass to \ufb02ow through the holes to become a \ufb01brous mass suitable for thermal and acoustical insulation. \rDrawing of Continuous Filaments In this process, illustrated in Figure 12.9, continuous glass \ufb01bers of small diameter (lower size limit is around 0.0025 mm or 0.0001 in) are produced by drawing strands of molten glass through small ori\ufb01ces in \r\rFIGURE 12.9 Drawing ofcontinuous glass \ufb01bers. \r\ra heated plate made of a platinum alloy. The plate may have several hundred holes, each making one \ufb01ber. The individual \ufb01bers are collected into a strand by reeling them onto a spool. Before spooling, the \ufb01bers are coated with various chemicals to lubricate and protect them. Drawing speeds of around 50 m/s (10,000 ft/min) or more are not unusual. \r\r\r\rHeat Treatment and Finishing \rHeat treatment of the glass product is the third step in the glassworking sequence.

Before spooling, the \ufb01bers are coated with various chemicals to lubricate and protect them. Drawing speeds of around 50 m/s (10,000 ft/min) or more are not unusual. \r\r\r\rHeat Treatment and Finishing \rHeat treatment of the glass product is the third step in the glassworking sequence. For some products, additional \ufb01nishing operations are performed. \r12.3.1 HEAT TREATMENT \rGlass-ceramics were discussed in Section 7.4.3. This unique material is made by a special heat treatment that transforms most of the vitreous state into a polycrystalline ceramic. Other heat treatments performed on glass cause changes that are less dramatic technologically but perhaps more important commercially; examples include annealing and tempering. \rAnnealing Glass products usually have undesirable internal stresses after forming, which reduce their strength. Annealing is done to relieve these stresses; the treatment therefore has the same function in glassworking as it does in metalworking. Annealing involves heating the glass to an elevated temperature and holding it for a certain period to eliminate stresses and temperature gradients, then slowly cooling the glass to suppress stress formation, followed by more rapid cooling to room temperature.Common annealing temperatures are around 500\u00b0C (900\u00b0F).The length of time the product is held at the temperature, as well as the heating and cooling rates during the cycle, depend on thickness of the glass, the usual rule being that the required annealing time varies with the square of thickness. \rAnnealing in modern glass factories is performed in tunnel-like furnaces, called lehrs, in which the products \ufb02ow slowly through the hot chamber on conveyors. Burners are located only at the front end of the chamber, so that the glass experiences the required heating and cooling cycle. \rTempered Glass and Related Products A bene\ufb01cial internal stress pattern can be developed in glass products by a heat treatment known as tempering, and the resulting material is called tempered glass.As in the treatment of hardened steel, tempering increases the toughness of glass. The process involves heating the glass to a temperature somewhat above its annealing temperature and into the plastic range, followed by quenching of the surfaces, usually with air jets. When the surfaces cool, they contract and harden while the interior is still plastic and compliant.As the internal glass slowly cools, it contracts, thus putting the hard surfaces in compression. Like other ceramics, glass is much stronger when subjected to compressive stresses than tensile stresses.Accordingly, tempered glass is much more resistant to scratching and breaking because of the compressive stresses on its surfaces.Applications include windows for tall buildings, all-glass doors, safety glasses, and other products requiring toughened glass. \rWhen tempered glass fails, it does so by shattering into numerous small fragments that are less likely to cut someone than conventional (annealed) window glass. Interestingly, automobile windshields are not made of tempered glass, because of the danger posed to the driver by this fragmentation. Instead, conventional glass is used; however, it is fabricated by sandwiching two pieces of glass on either side of a tough polymer sheet. Should this laminated glass fracture, the glass splinters are retained by the polymer sheet and the windshield remains relatively transparent. \r\r12.3.2 FINISHING \r\rFinishing operations are sometimes required for glassware products. These secondary operations include grinding, polishing, and cutting. When glass sheets are produced by drawing and rolling, the opposite sides are not necessarily parallel, and the surfaces contain defects and scratch marks caused by the use of hard tooling on soft glass. The glass sheets must be ground and polished for most commercial applications. In pressing and blowing operations when split dies are used, polishing is often required to remove the seam marks from the container product. \rIn continuous glassworking processes, such as plate and tube production, the continuous sections must be cut into smaller pieces.This is accomplished by \ufb01rst scoring the glass with a glass-cutting wheel or cutting diamond and then breaking the section along the score line. Cutting is generally done as the glass exits the annealing lehr. \rDecorative and surface processes are performed on certain glassware products. These processes include mechanical cutting and polishing operations; sandblasting; chemical etching (with hydro\ufb02uoric acid, often in combination with other chemicals); and coating (for example, coating of plate glass with aluminum or silver to produce mirrors). \r\r\rProduct Design Considerations \rGlass possesses special properties that make it desirable in certain applications.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 13409, "end_char_idx": 18299, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9cd45cd9-eb02-4ecd-9590-169e06ab1875": {"__data__": {"id_": "9cd45cd9-eb02-4ecd-9590-169e06ab1875", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec12.txt", "file_name": "sec12.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19920, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "102f3d5b-6040-4b93-825f-dba69154742c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec12.txt", "file_name": "sec12.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19920, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4a2c983ce0b73707fb14f123435391fb507c4f067d5bfed8a2ef166de2335f72", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "76749e09-b96f-4c07-9440-eaa78ef214a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec12.txt", "file_name": "sec12.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19920, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "a2f19f8de9fbe97d2c626795a178b0d08015d8829ee75cccbd580d49c96a13fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The glass sheets must be ground and polished for most commercial applications.

For applications requiring transparency, light transmittance, magni\ufb01cation, and similar optical properties, glass is likely to be the material of choice. Certain polymers are transparent and may be competitive, depending on design requirements. \r\r\u27a2 \rGlass is several times stronger in compression than in tension; components should be designed so that they are subjected to compressive stresses, not tensile stresses. \r\r\u27a2 \rCeramics, including glass, are brittle. Glass parts should not be used in applications that involve impact loading or high stresses which might cause fracture. \r\r\u27a2 \rCertain glass compositions have very low thermal expansion coef\ufb01cients and are therefore tolerant of thermal shock. These glasses can be selected for applications in which this characteristic is important (e.g., cookware). \r\r\u27a2 \rOutside edges and corners on glass parts should have large radii or chamfers; likewise, inside corners should have large radii. Both outside and inside corners are potential points of stress concentration. \r\r\u27a2 \rUnlike parts made of traditional and new ceramics, threads may be included in the design of glass parts; they are technically feasible with the press-and-blow shaping processes.

In addition, plastics are often the principal ingredient in other materials, such as paints and varnishes, adhesives, and various polymer matrix composites. This chapter considers the technologies by which these products are shaped, postponing paints and varnishes, adhesives, and composites until later chapters. Many plastic-shaping processes can be adapted to polymer matrix composites and rubbers (Chapter 14). \rThe commercial and technological importance of these shaping processes derives from the growing importance of the materials being processed.Applications of plastics have increased at a much faster rate than either metals or ceramics during the last 50 years. Indeed, many parts previously made of metals are today being made of plastics and plastic composites. The same is true of glass; plastic containers have been largely substituted for glass bottles and jars in product packaging. The total volume of polymers (plastics and rubbers) now exceeds that of metals. There are several reasons why the plastic-shaping processes are important: \r\u27a2 \rThe variety of shaping processes, and the ease with which polymers can be processed, allows an almost unlimited variety of part geometries to be formed. \r\r\u27a2 \rMany plastic parts are formed by molding, which is a net shape process. Further shaping is generally not needed. \r\r\u27a2 \rAlthough heating is usually required to form plastics, less energy is required than for metals because the processing temperatures are much lower. \r\r\u27a2 \rBecause lower temperatures are used in processing, handling of the product is simpli\ufb01ed during production. Because many plastic processing methods are \r\r\r\rone-step operations (e.g., molding), the amount of product handling required is substantially reduced compared with metals. \r\r\u27a2 Finishing by painting or plating is not required (except in unusual circumstances) for plastics. \rAs discussed in Chapter 8, the two types of plastics are thermoplastics and thermosets. The difference is that thermosets undergo a curing process during heating and shaping, which causes a permanent chemical change (cross-linking) in their molecular structure. Once they have been cured, they cannot be melted through reheating. By contrast, thermoplastics do not cure, and their chemical structure remains basically unchanged upon reheating even though they transform from solid to \ufb02uid. Of the two types, thermoplastics are by far the more important type commercially, comprising more than 80% of the total plastics tonnage. \rPlastic-shaping processes can be classi\ufb01ed as follows according to the resulting product geometry: (1) continuous extruded products with constant cross section other than sheets, \ufb01lms, and \ufb01laments; (2) continuous sheets and \ufb01lms; (3) continuous \ufb01 laments (\ufb01bers); (4) molded parts that are mostly solid; (5) hollow molded parts with relatively thin walls; (6) discrete parts made of formed sheets and \ufb01lms; (7) castings; and (8) foamed products.

This chapter examines each of these categories. The most important processes commercially are those associated with thermoplastics; the two processes of greatest signi\ufb01cance are extrusion and injection molding. A brief history of plastic-shaping processes is presented in Historical Note 13.1. \rCoverage of the plastic-shaping processes begins by examining the properties of polymer melts, because nearly all of the thermoplastic shaping processes share the common step of heating the plastic so that it \ufb02ows. \rHistorical Note 13.1 Plastic shaping processes \rEquipment for shaping plastics evolved largely from rubber processing technology. Noteworthy among the early contributors was Edwin Chaffee, an American who developed a two-roll steam-heated mill for mixing additives into rubber around 1835 (Section 14.5.2). He was also responsible for a similar device called a calender, which consists of a series of heated rolls for coating rubber onto cloth (Section 13.3). Both machines are still used today for plastics as well as rubbers. \rThe \ufb01 rst extruders, dating from around 1845 in England, were ram-driven machines for extruding rubber and coating rubber onto electrical wire. The trouble with ram-type extruders is that they operate in an intermittent fashion. An extruder that could operate continuously, especially for wire and cable coating, was highly desirable. Although several individuals worked with varying degrees of success on a screw-type extruder (Section 13.2.1), Mathew Gray in England is credited with the invention; his patent is dated 1879. As thermoplastics were subsequently developed, these screw extruders, originally designed for rubber, were adapted. An extrusion machine speci\ufb01 cally designed for thermoplastics was introduced in 1935. \rInjection molding machines for plastics were adaptations of equipment designed for metal die casting (Historical Note 11.2). Around 1872, John Hyatt, an important \ufb01gure in the development of plastics (Historical Note 8.1), patented a molding machine speci\ufb01 cally for plastics. It was a plunger-type machine (Section 13.6.3). The injection molding machine in its modern form was introduced in 1921, with semiautomatic controls added in 1937. Ram-type machines were the standard in the plastic molding industry for many decades, until the superiority of the reciprocating screw machine, developed by William Willert in the United States in 1952, became obvious. \r\r\r\r\r\rProperties of Polymer Melts \rTo shape a thermoplastic polymer it must be heated so that it softens to the consistency of a liquid. In this form, it is called a polymer melt. Polymer melts exhibit several unique properties and characteristics, considered in this section. \rViscosity Because of its high molecular weight, a polymer melt is a thick \ufb02uid with high viscosity. As the term is de\ufb01ned in Section 3.4, viscosity is a \ufb02 uid property that relates the shear stress experienced during \ufb02ow of the \ufb02uid to the rate of shear.

Polymer melts exhibit several unique properties and characteristics, considered in this section. \rViscosity Because of its high molecular weight, a polymer melt is a thick \ufb02uid with high viscosity. As the term is de\ufb01ned in Section 3.4, viscosity is a \ufb02 uid property that relates the shear stress experienced during \ufb02ow of the \ufb02uid to the rate of shear. Viscosity is important in polymer processing because most of the shaping methods involve \ufb02ow of the polymer melt through small channels or die openings. The \ufb02ow rates are often large, thus leading to high rates of shear; and the shear stresses increase with shear rate, so that signi\ufb01cant pressures are required to accomplish the processes. \rFigure 13.1 shows viscosity as a function of shear rate for two types of \ufb02uids. For a Newtonian \ufb02 uid (which includes most simple \ufb02uids such as water and oil), viscosity is a constant at a given temperature; it does not change with shear rate. The relationship between shear stress and shear strain is proportional, with viscosity as the constant of proportionality: \rt ! hg? or h ! gt? (13.1) \rwhere t ! shear stress, Pa (lb/in2); h ! coef\ufb01cient of shear viscosity, Ns/m2, or Pa-s (lb-sec/in2); and \u03b3! shear rate, 1/s (1/sec). However, for a polymer melt, viscosity decreases with shear rate, indicating that the \ufb02uid becomes thinner at higher rates of shear. This behavior is called pseudoplasticity and can be modeled to a reasonable approximation by the expression \rt ! k(g?)n (13.2) \rwhere k  a constant corresponding to the viscosity coef\ufb01 cient and n  \ufb02ow behavior index. For n ! 1, the equation reduces to the previous Equation (13.1) for a Newtonian \ufb02 uid, and k becomes h. For a polymer melt, values of n are less than 1. \rIn addition to the effect of shear rate (\ufb02 uid \ufb02 ow rate), viscosity of a poly\rmer melt is also affected by temperature. Like most \ufb02uids, the value decreases \rwith increasing temperature. This is shown in Figure 13.2 for several common \r\r\r\rFIGURE 13.2 Viscosity as a function of temperatures forselected polymers ata shear rate of 103 s1. (Data compiledfrom [12].) \rpolymers at a shear rate of 103 s1, which is approximately the same as the rates encountered in injection molding and high speed extrusion. Thus, the viscosity of a polymer melt decreases with increasing values of shear rate and temperature. Equation (13.2) can be applied, except that k depends on temperature as shown in Figure 13.2. \rViscoelasticity Another property possessed by polymer melts is viscoelasticity, which was discussed in the context of solid polymers in Section 3.5. However, liquid polymers exhibit it also. A good example is die swell in extrusion, in which the hot plastic expands when exiting the die opening. The phenomenon, illustrated in Figure 13.3, can be explained by noting that the polymer was contained in a much larger cross section before entering the narrow die channel. In effect, the extruded material \u201cremembers\u201d its former shape and attempts to return to it after leaving the die ori\ufb01ce. More technically, the compressive stresses acting on the material as it enters the small die opening do not relax immediately. When the material subsequently exits the ori\ufb01ce and the restriction is removed, the unrelaxed stresses cause the cross section to expand. \r\rFIGURE 13.3 Die swell, a manifestation of viscoelasticity in polymer melts, as depicted here on exiting an extrusion die. \rDie swell can be most easily measured for a circular cross section by means of the swell ratio, de\ufb01ned as \rDx\rrs !

The amount of die swell depends on the time the polymer melt spends in the die channel. Increasing the time in the channel, by means of a longer channel, reduces die swell. \r\r\rExtrusion \rExtrusion is one of the fundamental shaping processes, for metals and ceramics as well as polymers. Extrusion is a compression process in which material is forced to \ufb02ow through a die ori\ufb01ce to provide long continuous product whose cross-sectional shape is determined by the shape of the ori\ufb01ce. As a polymer shaping process, it is widely used for thermoplastics and elastomers (but rarely for thermosets) to mass produce items such as tubing, pipes, hose, structural shapes (such as window and door moldings), sheet and \ufb01lm, continuous \ufb01laments, and coated electrical wire and cable. For these types of products, extrusion is carried out as a continuous process; the extrudate (extruded product) is subsequently cut into desired lengths. This section covers the basic extrusion process, and several subsequent sections examine processes based on extrusion. \r\r13.2.1 PROCESS AND EQUIPMENT \rIn polymer extrusion, feedstock in pellet or powder form is fed into an extrusion barrel where it is heated and melted and forced to \ufb02ow through a die opening by means of a rotating screw, as illustrated in Figure 13.4. The two main components of the extruder are the barrel and the screw. The die is not a component of the extruder; it is a special tool that must be fabricated for the particular pro\ufb01le to be produced. \r\r\rThe internal diameter of the extruder barrel typically ranges from 25 to 150 mm (1.0\u20136.0 in). The barrel is long relative to its diameter, with L/D ratios usually between 10 and 30. The L/D ratio is reduced in Figure 13.4 for clarity of drawing. The higher ratios are used for thermoplastic materials, whereas lower L/D values are for elastomers. A hopper containing the feedstock is located at the end of the barrel opposite the die. The pellets are fed by gravity onto the rotating screw whose turning moves the material along the barrel. Electric heaters are used to initially melt the solid pellets; subsequent mixing and mechanical working of the material generate additional heat, which maintains the melt. In some cases, enough heat is supplied through the mixing and shearing action that external heating is not required. Indeed, in some cases the barrel must be externally cooled to prevent overheating of the polymer. \rThe material is conveyed through the barrel toward the die opening by the action of the extruder screw, which rotates at about 60 rev/min. The screw serves several functions and is divided into sections that correspond to these functions. The sections and functions are the (1) feed section, in which the stock is moved from the hopper port and preheated; (2) compression section, where the polymer is transformed into liquid consistency, air entrapped amongst the pellets is extracted from the melt, and the material is compressed; and (3) metering section, in which the melt is homogenized and suf\ufb01 cient pressure is developed to pump it through the die opening. \rThe operation of the screw is determined by its geometry and speed of rotation. Typical extruder screw geometry is depicted in Figure 13.5. The screw consists of spiraled \u201c\ufb02 ights\u201d (threads) with channels between them through which the polymer melt is moved. The channel has a width wc and depth dc. As the screw rotates, the \ufb02 ights push the material forward through the channel from the hopper end of the barrel toward the die. Although not discernible in the diagram, the \ufb02 ight diameter is smaller than the barrel diameter D by a very small clearance\u2014around 0.05 mm \r(0.002 in).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 9732, "end_char_idx": 13922, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c586f013-fb68-4827-b344-4ca405f91a09": {"__data__": {"id_": "c586f013-fb68-4827-b344-4ca405f91a09", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f7c375a7-9619-41c9-99e8-a5a20e19e9b8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4fd7d4c194b6dbc7df7e77c4a1cc0cb2aa758d568ee5a2373b3885724077eee6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "427d5af9-0034-4c21-8107-7f75b3d813ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "66680a9433424bcffb8ec9e4f3b9772a45926253dcf07c0f238da5b7d6d08a98", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "39b1cf2f-22e8-4e53-a5ee-1662eac6c1d1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4d578eb4655d56bcd47d37af180e5a7d724f272d2c3d77356ed4fef4c444319b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The operation of the screw is determined by its geometry and speed of rotation.

The channel has a width wc and depth dc. As the screw rotates, the \ufb02 ights push the material forward through the channel from the hopper end of the barrel toward the die. Although not discernible in the diagram, the \ufb02 ight diameter is smaller than the barrel diameter D by a very small clearance\u2014around 0.05 mm \r(0.002 in). The function of the clearance is to limit leakage of the melt backward to the trailing channel. The \ufb02ight land has a width wf and is made of hardened steel to resist wear as it turns and rubs against the inside of the barrel.The screw has a pitch whose value is usually close to the diameter D. The \ufb02 ight angle A is the helix angle of the screw and can be determined from the relation \r\rp\rtan A ! (13.4)\rpD \rwhere p  pitch of the screw.1 \rThe increase in pressure applied to the polymer melt in the three sections of the barrel is determined largely by the channel depth dc. In Figure 13.4, dc is relatively large in the feed section to allow large amounts of granular polymer to be admitted into the barrel. In the compression section, dc is gradually reduced, thus applying increased pressure on the polymer as it melts. In the metering section, dc is small and pressure reaches a maximum as \ufb02ow is restrained at the die end of the barrel. The three sections of the screw are shown as being about equal in length in Figure 13.4; this is appropriate for a polymer that melts gradually, such as low-density polyethylene. For other polymers, the optimal section lengths are different. For crystalline polymers such as nylon, melting occurs rather abruptly at a speci\ufb01c melting point; therefore, a short compression section is appropriate. Amorphous polymers such as polyvinylchloride melt more slowly than LDPE, and the compression zone for these materials must take almost the entire length of the screw. Although the optimal screw design for each material type is different, it is common practice to use general-purpose screws. These designs represent a compromise among the different materials, and they avoid the need to make frequent screw changes, which result in costly equipment downtime. \rProgress of the polymer along the barrel leads ultimately to the die zone. Before reaching the die, the melt passes through a screen pack\u2014a series of wire meshes supported by a stiff plate (called a breaker plate) containing small axial holes. The screen pack assembly functions to (1) \ufb01lter contaminants and hard lumps from the melt; (2) build pressure in the metering section; and (3) straighten the \ufb02ow of the polymer melt and remove its \u201cmemory\u201d of the circular motion imposed by the screw. This last function is concerned with the polymer\u2019s viscoelastic property; if the \ufb02ow were left unstraightened, the polymer would play back its history of turning inside the extrusion chamber, tending to twist and distort the extrudate. \r\r\r13.2.2 ANALYSIS OF EXTRUSION \rIn this section, mathematical models are developed to describe, in a simpli\ufb01ed way, several aspects of polymer extrusion. \rMelt Flow in the Extruder As the screw rotates inside the barrel, the polymer melt is forced to move forward toward the die; the system operates much like an Archimedean screw.

The operating parameters can be changed during the process to affect output \ufb02ow; they include rotational speed N, head pressure p, and melt viscosity h. Of course, melt viscosity is controllable only to the extent to which temperature and shear rate can be manipulated to affect this property.

The melt then \ufb02ows through the die opening itself. \rWhen the material exits the die, it is still soft. Polymers with high melt viscosities are the best candidates for extrusion, because they hold shape better during cooling. Cooling is accomplished by air blowing, water spray, or passing the extrudate through a water trough. To compensate for die swell, the die opening is made long enough to remove some of the memory in the polymer melt. In addition, the extrudate is often drawn (stretched) to offset expansion from die swell. \rFor shapes other than round, the die opening is designed with a cross section that is slightly different from the desired pro\ufb01 le, so that the effect of die swell is to provide shape correction. This correction is illustrated in Figure 13.9 for a square cross section. Because different polymers exhibit varying degrees of die swell, the shape of the die pro\ufb01le depends on the material to be extruded. Considerable skill and judgment are required by the die designer for complex cross sections. \rHollow Pro\ufb01les Extrusion of hollow pro\ufb01les, such as tubes, pipes, hoses, and other cross sections containing holes, requires a mandrel to form the hollow shape. \r\r\r\r(b) \rFIGURE 13.9 (a) Die cross sectionshowing required ori\ufb01ce pro\ufb01le to obtain (b) a square extruded pro\ufb01le. \rA typical die con\ufb01guration is shown in Figure 13.10. The mandrel is held in place using a spider, seen in Section A-A of the \ufb01gure. The polymer melt \ufb02ows around the legs supporting the mandrel to reunite into a monolithic tube wall. The mandrel often includes an air channel through which air is blown to maintain the hollow form of the extrudate during hardening. Pipes and tubes are cooled using open water troughs or by pulling the soft extrudate through a water-\ufb01lled tank with sizing sleeves that limit the OD of the tube while air pressure is maintained on the inside. \rWire and Cable Coating The coating of wire and cable for insulation is one of the most important polymer extrusion processes. As shown in Figure 13.11 for wire coating, the polymer melt is applied to the bare wire as it is pulled at high speed through a die. A slight vacuum is drawn between the wire and the polymer to promote adhesion of the coating.The taught wire provides rigidity during cooling,which is usually aided by passing the coated wire through a water trough.

One of the worst is melt fracture, in which the stresses acting on the melt immediately before and during its \ufb02 ow through the die are so high as to cause failure, manifested in the form of a highly irregular surface on the extrudate. As suggested by Figure 13.12, melt fracture can be caused by a sharp reduction at the die entrance, causing turbulent \ufb02 ow that breaks up the melt. This contrasts with the streamlined, laminar \ufb02 ow in the gradually converging die in Figure 13.8. \rA more common defect in extrusion is sharkskin, in which the surface of the product becomes roughened upon exiting the die.

The term sheet refers to stock with a thickness ranging from 0.5 mm (0.020 in) to about 12.5 mm (0.5 in) and used for products such as \ufb02at window glazing and stock for thermoforming (Section 13.9). Film refers to thicknesses below 0.5 mm (0.020 in). Thin \ufb01lms are used for packaging (product wrapping material, grocery bags, and garbage bags); thicker \ufb01lm applications include covers and liners (pool covers and liners for irrigation ditches). \rAll of the processes covered in this section are continuous, high-production operations. More than half of the \ufb01lms produced today are polyethylene, mostly low-density PE. The principal other materials are polypropylene, polyvinylchloride, and regenerated cellulose (cellophane). These are all thermoplastic polymers. \rSlit-Die Extrusion of Sheet and Film Sheet and \ufb01lm of various thicknesses are produced by conventional extrusion, using a narrow slit as the die opening. The slit may be up to 3 m (10 ft) wide and as narrow as around 0.4 mm (0.015 in). One possible die con\ufb01guration is illustrated in Figure 13.14. The die includes a manifold that spreads the polymer melt laterally before it \ufb02ows through the slit (die ori\ufb01ce). One of the dif\ufb01culties in this extrusion method is uniformity of thickness throughout the width of the stock. This is caused by the drastic shape change experienced by \r\r\r\rFIGURE 13.15 \rextrusion. \rUse of (a) water quenching bath or (b) chill rolls to achieve fast solidi\ufb01cation of the molten \ufb01lm after \rthe polymer melt during its \ufb02ow through the die and also to temperature and pressure variations in the die. Usually, the edges of the \ufb01lm must be trimmed because of thickening at the edges. \rTo achieve high production rates, an ef\ufb01cient method of cooling and collecting the \ufb01lm must be integrated with the extrusion process.This is usually done by immediately directing the extrudate into a quenching bath of water or onto chill rolls, as shown in Figure 13.15.

Owing to the cooling method used in this process, it is known as chill-roll extrusion. \rBlown-Film Extrusion Process This is the other widely used process for making thin polyethylene \ufb01 lm for packaging. It is a complex process, combining extrusion and blowing to produce a tube of thin \ufb01lm; it is best explained with reference to the diagram in Figure 13.16. The process begins with the extrusion of a tube that is immediately drawn upward while still molten and simultaneously expanded in size by air in\ufb02ated into it through the die mandrel. A \u201cfrost line\u201d marks the position along the upward moving bubble where solidi\ufb01cation of the polymer occurs. Air pressure in the bubble must be kept constant to maintain uniform \ufb01lm thickness and tube diameter. The air is contained in the tube by pinch rolls that squeeze the tube back together after it has cooled. Guide rolls and collapsing rolls are also used to restrain the blown tube and direct it into the pinch rolls. The \ufb02at tube is then collected onto a windup reel. \rThe effect of air in\ufb02ation is to stretch the \ufb01lm in both directions as it cools from the molten state. This results in isotropic strength properties, which is an advantage over other processes in which the material is stretched primarily in one direction. Other advantages include the ease with which extrusion rate and air pressure can be changed to control stock width and gage. Comparing this process with slit-die extrusion, the blown-\ufb01lm method produces stronger \ufb01lm (so that a thinner \ufb01lm can be used to package a product), but thickness control and production rates are lower. \r\rThe \ufb01nal blown \ufb01lm can be left in tubular form (e.g., for garbage bags), or it can be subsequently cut at the edges to provide two parallel thin \ufb01lms. \rCalendering Calendering is a process for producing sheet and \ufb01lm stock out of rubber (Section 14.5.3) or rubbery thermoplastics such as plasticized PVC. In the process, the initial feedstock is passed through a series of rolls to work the material and reduce its thickness to the desired gage.A typical setup is illustrated in Figure 13.17.The equipment is expensive, but production rate is high; speeds approaching 2.5 m/s (500 ft/min) are possible. Close control is required over roll temperatures, pressures, and rotational speed. The process is noted for its good surface \ufb01nish and high gage accuracy in the \ufb01 lm. Plastic products made by the calendering process include PVC \ufb02 oor covering, shower curtains, vinyl table cloths, pool liners, and in\ufb02atable boats and toys. \r\r\r\rFiber and Filament Production (Spinning) \rThe most important application of polymer \ufb01bers and \ufb01laments is in textiles. Their use as reinforcing materials in plastics (composites) is a growing application, but still small compared with textiles.A \ufb01 ber can be de\ufb01ned as a long, thin strand of material whose length is at least 100 times its cross-sectional dimension. A \ufb01 lament is a \ufb01ber of continuous length. \rFibers can be natural or synthetic. Synthetic \ufb01bers constitute about 75% of the total \ufb01ber market today, polyester being the most important, followed by nylon, acrylics, and rayon. Natural \ufb01bers are about 25% of the total produced, with cotton by far the most important staple (wool production is signi\ufb01cantly less than cotton). \rThe term spinning is a holdover from the methods used to draw and twist natural \ufb01 bers into yarn or thread.

In the production of synthetic \ufb01 bers, the term refers to the process of extruding a polymer melt or solution through a spinneret (a die with multiple small holes) to make \ufb01laments that are then drawn and wound onto a bobbin. There are three principal variations in the spinning of synthetic \ufb01 bers, depending on the polymer being processed: (1) melt spinning, (2) dry spinning, and (3) wet spinning. \rMelt spinning is used when the starting polymer can best be processed by heating to the molten state and pumping through the spinneret, much in the manner of conventional extrusion. A typical spinneret is 6 mm (0.25 in) thick and contains approximately 50 holes of diameter 0.25 mm (0.010 in); the holes are countersunk, so that the resulting bore has an L/D ratio of only 5/1 or less. The \ufb01laments that emanate from the die are drawn and simultaneously air cooled before being collected together and spooled onto the bobbin, as shown in Figure 13.18. Signi\ufb01cant extension and thinning of the \ufb01laments occur while the polymer is still molten, so that the \ufb01nal diameter wound onto the bobbin may be only 1/10 of the extruded size. Melt spinning is used for polyesters and nylons; because these are the most important synthetic \ufb01bers, melt spinning is the most important of the three processes for synthetic \ufb01bers. \r\r\rIn dry spinning, the starting polymer is in solution and the solvent can be separated by evaporation. The extrudate is pulled through a heated chamber that removes the solvent; otherwise the sequence is similar to the previous. Fibers of cellulose acetate and acrylic are produced by this process. In wet spinning, the polymer is also in solution\u2014only the solvent is nonvolatile. To separate the polymer, the extrudate must be passed through a liquid chemical that coagulates or precipitates the polymer into coherent strands that are then collected onto bobbins.This method is used to produce rayon (regenerated cellulose \ufb01bers). \rFilaments produced by any of the three processes are usually subjected to further cold drawing to align the crystal structure along the direction of the \ufb01 lament axis. Extensions of 2 to 8 are typical [13]. This has the effect of signi\ufb01cantly increasing the tensile strength of the \ufb01bers. Drawing is accomplished by pulling the thread between two spools,where the winding spool is driven at a faster speed than the unwinding spool. \r\rCoating Processes \rPlastic (or rubber) coating involves application of a layer of the given polymer onto a substrate material. Three categories are distinguished [6]: (1) wire and cable coating; \r(2) planar coating, which involves the coating of a \ufb02 at \ufb01 lm; and (3) contour coating\u2014 the coating of a three-dimensional object. Wire and cable coating has already been covered (Section 13.2.3); it is basically an extrusion process. The other two categories are surveyed in the following paragraphs. In addition, there is the technology of applying paints, varnishes, lacquers, and other similar coatings (Section 27.6). \rPlanar coating is used to coat fabrics, paper, cardboard, and metal foil; these items are major products for some plastics. The important polymers include polyethylene and polypropylene, with lesser applications for nylon, PVC, and polyester. In most cases, the coating is only 0.01 to 0.05 mm (0.0005\u20130.002 in) thick.

Dipping involves submersion of the object into a suitable bath of polymer melt or solution, followed by cooling or drying. Spraying (such as spray-painting) is an alternative method for applying a polymer coating to a solid object. \rInjection Molding \rInjection molding is a process in which a polymer is heated to a highly plastic state and forced to \ufb02ow under high pressure into a mold cavity, where it solidi\ufb01es. The molded part, called a molding, is then removed from the cavity. The process produces discrete components that are almost always net shape. The production cycle time is typically in the range of 10 to 30 sec, although cycles of 1 min or longer are not uncommon for large parts. Also, the mold may contain more than one cavity, so that multiple moldings are produced each cycle. A collection of plastic injection moldings is displayed in Figure 13.20. \rComplex and intricate shapes are possible with injection molding. The challenge in these cases is to fabricate a mold whose cavity is the same geometry as the part and that also allows for part removal. Part size can range from about 50 g (2 oz) up to about 25 kg (more than 50 lb), the upper limit represented by components such as refrigerator doors and automobile bumpers. The mold determines the part shape and size and is the special tooling in injection molding. For large, complex parts, the mold can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. For small parts, the mold can be built to contain multiple cavities, also making the mold expensive. Thus, injection molding is economical only for large production quantities. \rFIGURE 13.20 \rA collection of plasticinjection-molded parts.(Courtesy of George E.Kane ManufacturingTechnology Laboratory, Lehigh University.) \r\r\rInjection molding is the most widely used molding process for thermoplastics. Some thermosets and elastomers are injection molded, with modi\ufb01cations in equipment and operating parameters to allow for cross-linking of these materials. These and other variations of injection molding are discussed in Section 13.6.5. \r\r13.6.1 PROCESS AND EQUIPMENT \rEquipment for injection molding evolved from metal die casting (Historical Note 13.1). A large injection molding machine is shown in Figure 13.21. As illustrated in the schematic in Figure 13.22, an injection molding machine consists of two principal components:(1) the plastic injection unit and (2) the mold clamping unit.The injection unit is much like an extruder. It consists of a barrel that is fed from one end by a hopper containing a supply of plastic pellets. Inside the barrel is a screw whose operation surpasses that of an extruder screw in the following respect: in addition to turning for mixing and heating the polymer, it also acts as a ram that rapidly moves forward to inject molten plastic into the mold. A nonreturn valve mounted near the tip of the screw prevents the melt from \ufb02owing backward along the screw threads. Later in the molding cycle the ram retracts to its former position. Because of its dual action, it is called a reciprocating screw, a name that also identi\ufb01es the machine type. Older injection molding machines used a simple ram (without screw \ufb02ights), but the superiority of the reciprocating screw design has led to its widespread adoption in today\u2019s molding plants.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 39583, "end_char_idx": 43889, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89380f7c-ef69-4886-b61e-3be900c79858": {"__data__": {"id_": "89380f7c-ef69-4886-b61e-3be900c79858", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f7c375a7-9619-41c9-99e8-a5a20e19e9b8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4fd7d4c194b6dbc7df7e77c4a1cc0cb2aa758d568ee5a2373b3885724077eee6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f31b926a-e460-4bb9-98db-db27838bb3a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "2a5fd26e0bf349993249d236f8ad0ff4554599a0ea0570cbd0d3ea49143e896b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c54e0f25-be0b-4a3a-8691-d664e9a0b965", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "60e9ffcebfaffce916fd6df0e5a933bda13e56aca6451bc109fc08c98e06dfd8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It consists of a barrel that is fed from one end by a hopper containing a supply of plastic pellets.

To summarize, the functions of the injection unit are to melt and homogenize the polymer, and then inject it into the mold cavity. \r\r\rThe clamping unit is concerned with the operation of the mold. Its functions are to (1) hold the two halves of the mold in proper alignment with each other; (2) keep the mold closed during injection by applying a clamping force suf\ufb01cient to resist the injection force; and (3) open and close the mold at the appropriate times in the molding cycle. The clamping unit consists of two platens, a \ufb01xed platen and a movable platen,and a mechanism for translating the latter.The mechanism is basically a power press that is operated by hydraulic piston or mechanical toggle devices of various types. Clamping forces of several thousand tons are available on large machines. \rThe cycle for injection molding of a thermoplastic polymer proceeds in the following sequence, illustrated in Figure 13.23. The action begins with the mold open and the machine ready to start a new molding: (1) The mold is closed and clamped. \r(2) A shot of polymer melt, which has been brought to the right temperature and viscosity by heating and the mechanical working of the screw, is injected under high pressure into the mold cavity.The plastic cools and begins to solidify when it encounters the cold surface of the mold. Ram pressure is maintained to pack additional melt into the cavity to compensate for contraction during cooling. (3) The screw is rotated and retracted with the nonreturn valve open to permit fresh polymer to \ufb02ow into the forward portion of the barrel. Meanwhile, the polymer in the mold has completely solidi\ufb01ed. (4) The mold is opened, and the part is ejected and removed. \r\r\r13.6.2 THE MOLD \rThe mold is the special tool in injection molding; it is custom-designed and fabricated for the given part to be produced. When the production run for that part is \ufb01 nished, the mold is replaced with a new mold for the next part.This section examines several types of mold for injection molding. \rTwo-Plate Mold The conventional two-plate mold, illustrated in Figure 13.24, consists of two halves fastened to the two platens of the molding machine\u2019s clamping unit. When the clamping unit is opened, the two mold halves open, as shown in (b). The most obvious feature of the mold is the cavity, which is usually formed by removing metal from the mating surfaces of the two halves. Molds can contain a single cavity or multiple cavities to produce more than one part in a single shot. The \ufb01gure shows a mold with two cavities. The parting surfaces (or parting line in a cross-sectional view of the mold) are where the mold opens to remove the part(s). \r\rIn addition to the cavity, other features of the mold serve indispensable functions during the molding cycle. A mold must have a distribution channel through which the polymer melt \ufb02ows from the nozzle of the injection barrel into the mold cavity. The distribution channel consists of (1) a sprue, which leads from the nozzle into the mold; (2) runners, which lead from the sprue to the cavity (or cavities); and (3) gates that constrict the \ufb02ow of plastic into the cavity. The constriction increases the shear rate,thereby reducing the viscosity of the polymer melt.There are one or more gates for each cavity in the mold. \rAn ejection system is needed to eject the molded part from the cavity at the end of the molding cycle. Ejector pins built into the moving half of the mold usually accomplish this function.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 43050, "end_char_idx": 47382, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c54e0f25-be0b-4a3a-8691-d664e9a0b965": {"__data__": {"id_": "c54e0f25-be0b-4a3a-8691-d664e9a0b965", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f7c375a7-9619-41c9-99e8-a5a20e19e9b8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4fd7d4c194b6dbc7df7e77c4a1cc0cb2aa758d568ee5a2373b3885724077eee6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "89380f7c-ef69-4886-b61e-3be900c79858", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "32e097cdf9692dfea93fad57f64f052cb075bd26ba5202e51bc96e450fe10af7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "32496950-c525-4054-b059-2543126c7f97", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "10add22ed1e89559376cedbcfc71457852edb1274cd92161bf5ae370ce62618c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In addition to the cavity, other features of the mold serve indispensable functions during the molding cycle.

Ejector pins built into the moving half of the mold usually accomplish this function. The cavity is divided between the two mold halves in such a way that the natural shrinkage of the molding causes the part to stick to the moving half. When the mold opens, the ejector pins push the part out of the mold cavity. \r\rA cooling system is required for the mold. This consists of an external pump connected to passageways in the mold, through which water is circulated to remove heat from the hot plastic.Air must be evacuated from the mold cavity as the polymer rushes in. Much of the air passes through the small ejector pin clearances in the mold. In addition, narrow air vents are often machined into the parting surface; only about 0.03 mm \r(0.001 in) deep and 12 to 25 mm (0.5\u20131.0 in) wide, these channels permit air to escape to the outside but are too small for the viscous polymer melt to \ufb02 ow through. \rTo summarize, a mold consists of (1) one or more cavities that determine part geometry, (2) distribution channels through which the polymer melt \ufb02ows to the cavities, (3) an ejection system for part removal, (4) a cooling system, and (5) vents to permit evacuation of air from the cavities. \rOther Mold Types The two-plate mold is the most common mold in injection molding. An alternative is a three-plate mold, shown in Figure 13.25, for the same part geometry as before. There are advantages to this mold design. First, the \ufb02 ow of molten plastic is through a gate located at the base of the cup-shaped part, rather than at the side. This allows more even distribution of melt into the sides of the cup. In the side gate design in the two-plate mold of Figure 13.24, the plastic must \ufb02 ow around the core and join on the opposite side, possibly creating a weakness at the weld line. Second, the three-plate mold allows more automatic operation of the molding machine. As the mold opens, it divides into three plates with two openings between them.This action separates the runner from the parts,which drop by gravity into containers beneath the mold. \rThe sprue and runner in a conventional two- or three-plate mold represent waste material. In many instances they can be ground and reused; however, in some cases the product must be made of \u201cvirgin\u201d plastic (plastic that has not been previously molded). The hot-runner mold eliminates the solidi\ufb01cation of the sprue and runner by locating heaters around the corresponding runner channels. Although the plastic in the mold cavity solidi\ufb01es, the material in the sprue and runner channels remains molten, ready to be injected into the cavity in the next cycle. \r\r13.6.3 INJECTION MOLDING MACHINES \rInjection molding machines differ in both injection unit and clamping unit. This section discusses the important types of machines available today. The name of the injection molding machine is generally based on the type of injection unit used. \rInjection Units Two types of injection units are widely used today.

Older machines used one plunger-driven barrel to melt and inject the plastic. These machines are referred to as plunger-type injection molding machines, Figure 13.26(b). \rClamping Units Clamping designs are of three types [11]: toggle, hydraulic, and hydromechanical. Toggle clamps include various designs, one of which is illustrated in Figure 13.27(a). An actuator moves the crosshead forward, extending the toggle links to push the moving platen toward a closed position. At the beginning of the movement, mechanical advantage is low and speed is high; but near the end of the stroke, the reverse is true. Thus, toggle clamps provide both high speed and high force at different points in the cycle when they are desirable. They are actuated either by hydraulic cylinders or ball screws driven by electric motors. Toggle-clamp units seem most suited to relatively low tonnage machines. Hydraulic clamps, shown in Figure 13.27(b), are used on higher-tonnage injection molding machines, typically in the range 1300 to 8900 kN (150 to 1000 tons). These units are also more \ufb02exible than toggle clamps in terms of setting the tonnage at given positions during the stroke. Hydromechanical clamps are designed for large tonnages, usually above 8900 kN (1000 tons). They operate by (1) using hydraulic cylinders to rapidly move the mold toward closing position, (2) locking the position by mechanical means, and (3) using high-pressure hydraulic cylinders to \ufb01nally close the mold and build tonnage. \r\r\r\r13.6.4 SHRINKAGE AND DEFECTS IN INJECTION MOLDING \rPolymers have high thermal expansion coef\ufb01cients, and signi\ufb01 cant shrinkage can occur during cooling of the plastic in the mold. Contraction of crystalline plastics tends to be greater than for amorphous polymers. Shrinkage is usually expressed as the reduction in linear size that occurs during cooling to room temperature from the molding temperature for the given polymer. Appropriate units are therefore mm/mm (in/in) of the dimension under consideration. Typical values for selected polymers are given in Table 13.1. \rFillers in the plastic tend to reduce shrinkage. In commercial molding practice, shrinkage values for the speci\ufb01c molding compound should be obtained from the producer before making the mold.

The same mold will produce different part sizes for different polymer types. \rValues in Table 13.1 represent a gross simpli\ufb01cation of the shrinkage issue. In reality, shrinkage is affected by a number of factors, any of which can alter the amount of contraction experienced by a given polymer. The most important factors are injection pressure, compaction time, molding temperature, and part thickness. As injection pressure is increased, forcing more material into the mold cavity, shrinkage is reduced. Increasing compaction time has a similar effect, assuming the polymer in the gate does not solidify and seal off the cavity; maintaining pressure forces more material into the cavity while shrinkage is taking place. Net shrinkage is thereby reduced. \rMolding temperature refers to the temperature of the polymer in the cylinder immediately before injection. One might expect that a higher polymer temperature would increase shrinkage, on the reasoning that the difference between molding and room temperatures is greater. However, shrinkage is actually lower at higher molding temperatures.The explanation is that higher temperatures signi\ufb01cantly lower the viscosity of the polymer melt, allowing more material to be packed into the mold; the effect is the same as higher injection pressures.Thus,the effect on viscosity more than compensates for the larger temperature difference. \rFinally, thicker parts show greater shrinkage. A molding solidi\ufb01es from the outside; the polymer in contact with the mold surface forms a skin that grows toward the center of the part.At some point during solidi\ufb01cation,the gate solidi\ufb01es,isolating the material in the cavity from the runner system and compaction pressure. When this happens, the molten polymer inside the skin accounts for most of the remaining shrinkage that occurs in the part.A thicker part section experiences greater shrinkage because it contains more molten material. \r\rIn addition to the shrinkage issue, other things can also go wrong. Here are some of the common defects in injection molded parts: \r\u27a2 \rShort shots. As in casting, a short shot is a molding that has solidi\ufb01ed before completely \ufb01lling the cavity.The defect can be corrected by increasing temperature and/or pressure. The defect may also result from use of a machine with insuf\ufb01cient shot capacity, in which case a larger machine is needed. \r\r\u27a2 \rFlashing. Flashing occurs when the polymer melt is squeezed into the parting surface between mold plates; it can also occur around ejection pins. The defect is usually caused by (1) vents and clearances in the mold that are too large; \r\r(2) injection pressure too high compared with clamping force; (3) melt temperature too high; or (4) excessive shot size. \r\r\r\u27a2 \rSink marks and voids.

Higher melt temperatures, higher injection pressures, alternative gating locations on the part, and better venting are ways of dealing with this defect. \r\r\r13.6.5 OTHER INJECTION MOLDING PROCESSES \rThe vast majority of injection molding applications involve thermoplastics. Several variants of the process are described in this section. \rThermoplastic Foam Injection Molding Plastic foams have a variety of applications, and these materials and their processing are discussed in Section 13.11. One of the processes, sometimes called structural foam molding, is appropriate to discuss here because it is injection molding. It involves the molding of thermoplastic parts that possess a dense outer skin surrounding a lightweight foam center. Such parts have high stiffness-to-weight ratios suitable for structural applications. \rA structural foam part can be produced either by introducing a gas into the molten plastic in the injection unit or by mixing a gas-producing ingredient with the starting pellets. During injection, an insuf\ufb01cient amount of melt is forced into the mold cavity, where it expands (foams) to \ufb01ll the mold. The foam cells in contact with the cold mold surface collapse to form a dense skin, while the material in the core retains its cellular structure. Items made of structural foam include electronic cases, business machine housings, furniture components, and washing machine tanks. Advantages cited for structural foam molding include lower injection pressures and clamping forces, and thus the capability to produce large components, as suggested by the preceding list. A disadvantage of the process is that the resulting part surfaces tend to be rough, with occasional voids. If good surface \ufb01nish is needed for the application, then additional processing is required, such as sanding, painting, and adhesion of a veneer. \rMulti-Injection Molding Processes Unusual effects can be achieved by multiple injection of different polymers to mold a part. The polymers are injected either simultaneously or sequentially, and there may be more than one mold cavity involved. Several processes fall under this heading, all characterized by two or more injection units\u2014thus, the equipment for these processes is expensive. \rSandwich molding involves injection of two separate polymers\u2014one is the outer skin of the part and the other is the inner core, which is typically a polymer foam. A specially designed nozzle controls the \ufb02 ow sequence of the two polymers into the mold. The sequence is designed so that the core polymer is completely surrounded by the skin material inside the mold cavity. The \ufb01 nal structure is similar to that of a structural foam molding. However, the molding possesses a smooth surface, thus overcoming one of the major shortcomings of the previous process. In addition, it consists of two distinct plastics, each with its own characteristics suited to the application. \rAnother multi-injection molding process involves sequential injection of two polymers into a two-position mold. With the mold in the \ufb01rst position, the \ufb01 rst polymer is injected into the cavity.Then the mold opens to the second position,and the second melt is injected into the enlarged cavity. The resulting part consists of two integrally connected plastics. Bi-injection molding is used to combine plastics of two different colors (e.g., automobile tail light covers) or to achieve different properties in different sections of the same part. \rInjection Molding of Thermosets Injection molding is used for thermosetting (TS) plastics, with certain modi\ufb01cations in equipment and operating procedure to allow for cross-linking. The machines for thermoset injection molding are similar to those used for thermoplastics. They use a reciprocating-screw injection unit, but the barrel length is shorter to avoid premature curing and solidi\ufb01cation of the TS polymer.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 57011, "end_char_idx": 61823, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c291b8f8-4f8e-4824-a419-b2eac9ecd49c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c291b8f8-4f8e-4824-a419-b2eac9ecd49c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f7c375a7-9619-41c9-99e8-a5a20e19e9b8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4fd7d4c194b6dbc7df7e77c4a1cc0cb2aa758d568ee5a2373b3885724077eee6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d7e8fde1-cabf-4459-96ca-ae373f55d8ff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "19ab7cdfe896c84e65fb7a9dc69d08590242c1a9e11360297c19ea41b795c265", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2003c935-0764-4431-9c79-0985a7ab2948", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8c4d1ef7d5183aa5ced765e873474d404fbc57a578a11ebb5836e89bf54a651e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "With the mold in the \ufb01rst position, the \ufb01 rst polymer is injected into the cavity.Then the mold opens to the second position,and the second melt is injected into the enlarged cavity.

The machines for thermoset injection molding are similar to those used for thermoplastics. They use a reciprocating-screw injection unit, but the barrel length is shorter to avoid premature curing and solidi\ufb01cation of the TS polymer. For the same reason, temperatures in the barrel are kept at relatively low levels, usually 50\u00b0C to 125\u00b0C (120\u00b0F\u2013260\u00b0F),depending on the polymer.The plastic,usually in the form of pellets or granules, is fed into the barrel through a hopper. Plasticizing occurs by the action of the rotating screw as the material is moved forward toward the nozzle. When suf\ufb01cient melt has accumulated ahead of the screw, it is injected into a mold that is heated to 150\u00b0C to 230\u00b0C (300\u00b0F\u2013450\u00b0F), where cross-linking occurs to harden the plastic. The mold is then opened, and the part is ejected and removed. Molding cycle times typically range from 20 sec to 2 min, depending on polymer type and part size. \rCuring is the most time-consuming step in the cycle. In many cases, the part can be removed from the mold before curing is completed, so that \ufb01nal hardening occurs because of retained heat within a minute or two after removal. An alternative approach is to use a multiple-mold machine, in which two or more molds are attached to an indexing head served by a single injection unit. \rThe principal thermosets for injection molding are phenolics, unsaturated polyesters, melamines, epoxies, and urea-formaldehyde. Elastomers are also injected molded (Section 14.5.3). More than 50% of the phenolic moldings currently produced in the United States are made by this process [11], representing a shift away from compression and transfer molding, the traditional processes used for thermosets (Section 13.7). Most of the TS molding materials contain large proportions of \ufb01llers (up to 70% by weight), including glass \ufb01 bers, clay, wood \ufb01bers, and carbon black. In effect, these are composite materials that are being injected molded. \r\rReaction Injection Molding Reaction injection molding (RIM) involves the mixing of two highly reactive liquid ingredients and immediately injecting the mixture into a mold cavity, where chemical reactions leading to solidi\ufb01 cation occur. The two ingredients form the components used in catalyst-activated or mixing-activated thermoset systems (Section 8.3.1). Urethanes, epoxies, and urea-formaldehyde are examples of these systems. RIM was developed with polyurethane to produce large automotive components such as bumpers, spoilers, and fenders. These kinds of parts still constitute the major application of the process. RIM-molded polyurethane parts typically possess a foam internal structure surrounded by a dense outer skin. \rAs shown in Figure 13.28, liquid ingredients are pumped in precisely measured amounts from separate holding tanks into a mixing head.The ingredients are rapidly mixed and then injected into the mold cavity at relatively low pressure where polymerization and curing occur. A typical cycle time is around 2 min. For relatively large cavities the molds for RIM are much less costly than corresponding molds for conventional injection molding. This is because of the low clamping forces required in RIM and the opportunity to use lightweight components in the molds. Other advantages of RIM include (1) low energy is required in the process; (2) equipment costs are less than injection molding; (3) a variety of chemical systems are available that enable speci\ufb01c properties to be obtained in the molded product; and (4) the production equipment is reliable, and the chemical systems and machine relationships are well understood [17]. \r\rFIGURE 13.28 Reaction injectionmolding (RIM) system,shown immediatelyafter ingredients A andB have been pumpedinto the mixing headprior to injection intothe mold cavity (somedetails of processingequipment omitted).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 60973, "end_char_idx": 65425, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2003c935-0764-4431-9c79-0985a7ab2948": {"__data__": {"id_": "2003c935-0764-4431-9c79-0985a7ab2948", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f7c375a7-9619-41c9-99e8-a5a20e19e9b8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4fd7d4c194b6dbc7df7e77c4a1cc0cb2aa758d568ee5a2373b3885724077eee6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c291b8f8-4f8e-4824-a419-b2eac9ecd49c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "abc7d5d96718c99f056d2a7017c81a47c706122c7c70b54bf016b1e3baf1e08f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0b7b706f-e194-44f0-96ab-ca8d4e0fc504", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "094c6e4db36b973df0f5e4a708cb9200afb9bb80cb721f53c24e1831598f23ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A typical cycle time is around 2 min.

For thermoplastics, these techniques cannot match the ef\ufb01ciency of injection molding, except for very special applications.  \r13.7.1  COMPRESSION MOLDING  \r\rCompression molding is an old and widely used molding process for thermosetting plastics. Its applications also include rubber tires and various polymer matrix composite parts. The process, illustrated in Figure 13.29 for a TS plastic, consists of (1) loading a precise amount of molding compound, called the charge, into the bottom half of a heated mold; (2) bringing the mold halves together to compress the charge, forcing it to \ufb02ow and conform to the shape of the cavity; (3) heating the charge by means of the hot mold to polymerize and cure the material into a solidi\ufb01ed part; and \r(4) opening the mold halves and removing the part from the cavity. \rThe initial charge of molding compound can be any of several forms, including powders or pellets, liquid, or preform. The amount of polymer must be precisely controlled to obtain repeatable consistency in the molded product. It has become common practice to preheat the charge before placing it into the mold; this softens the polymer and shortens the production cycle time. Preheating methods include infrared heaters, convection heating in an oven, and use of a heated rotating screw in a barrel. The latter technique (borrowed from injection molding) is also used to meter the amount of the charge. \rCompression molding presses are oriented vertically and contain two platens to which the mold halves are fastened. The presses involve either of two types of actuation: (1) upstroke of the bottom platen or (2) downstroke of the top platen, the former being the more common machine con\ufb01guration.They are generally powered by a hydraulic cylinder that can be designed to provide clamping capacities up to several hundred tons. \r\r\rMolds for compression molding are generally simpler than their injection mold counterparts. There is no sprue and runner system in a compression mold, and the process itself is generally limited to simpler part geometries because of the lower \ufb02ow capabilities of the starting thermosetting materials. However, provision must be made for heating the mold, usually accomplished by electric resistance heating, steam, or hot oil circulation. Compression molds can be classi\ufb01ed as hand molds, used for trial runs; semiautomatic, in which the press follows a programmed cycle but the operator manually loads and unloads the press; and automatic, which operate under a fully automatic press cycle (including automatic loading and unloading). \rMaterials for compression molding include phenolics, melamine, urea-formaldehyde,epoxies,urethanes,and elastomers.Typical moldings include electric plugs and sockets, pot handles, and dinnerware plates. Advantages of compression molding in these applications include (1) molds that are simpler and less expensive, (2) less scrap, and (3) low residual stresses in the molded parts. A typical disadvantage is longer cycle times and therefore lower production rates than injection molding. \r13.7.2 TRANSFER MOLDING \r\rIn this process, a thermosetting charge is loaded into a chamber immediately ahead of the mold cavity, where it is heated; pressure is then applied to force the softened polymer to \ufb02ow into the heated mold where curing occurs.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 64550, "end_char_idx": 68945, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b7b706f-e194-44f0-96ab-ca8d4e0fc504": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b7b706f-e194-44f0-96ab-ca8d4e0fc504", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f7c375a7-9619-41c9-99e8-a5a20e19e9b8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4fd7d4c194b6dbc7df7e77c4a1cc0cb2aa758d568ee5a2373b3885724077eee6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2003c935-0764-4431-9c79-0985a7ab2948", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "0c13ecb6eaf050314ee95cb6322c3538083486455e46d811a2d84ca6a5e19918", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b473f59b-4b60-4cfa-80ff-c200c0047f73", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "545d6a9fa5833216e53de80d63ff93ca815386dca0a01dcba3d6bd120e05616f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Materials for compression molding include phenolics, melamine, urea-formaldehyde,epoxies,urethanes,and elastomers.Typical moldings include electric plugs and sockets, pot handles, and dinnerware plates.

A typical disadvantage is longer cycle times and therefore lower production rates than injection molding. \r13.7.2 TRANSFER MOLDING \r\rIn this process, a thermosetting charge is loaded into a chamber immediately ahead of the mold cavity, where it is heated; pressure is then applied to force the softened polymer to \ufb02ow into the heated mold where curing occurs. There are two variants of the process, illustrated in Figure 13.30: (a) pot transfer molding, in which the charge is injected from a \u201cpot\u201d through a vertical sprue channel into the cavity; and \r(b) plunger transfer molding, in which the charge is injected by means of a plunger from a heated well through lateral channels into the mold cavity. In both cases, scrap is produced each cycle in the form of the leftover material in the base of the well and lateral channels, called the cull. In addition, the sprue in pot transfer is scrap material. Because the polymers are thermosetting, the scrap cannot be recovered. \rTransfer molding is closely related to compression molding, because it is used on the same polymer types (thermosets and elastomers). One can also see similarities to injection molding, in the way the charge is preheated in a separate chamber and then injected into the mold. Transfer molding is capable of molding part shapes that are more intricate than compression molding but not as intricate as injection molding. Transfer molding also lends itself to molding with inserts, in which a metal or ceramic insert is placed into the cavity before injection, and the heated plastic bonds to the insert during molding. \rBlow Molding and Rotational Molding \rBoth of these processes are used to make hollow, seamless parts out of thermoplastic polymers. Rotational molding can also be used for thermosets. Parts range in size from small plastic bottles of only 5 mL (0.15 oz) to large storage drums of 38,000-L (10,000-gal) capacity. Although the two processes compete in certain cases, generally they have found their own niches. Blow molding is more suited to the mass production of small disposable containers, whereas rotational molding favors large, hollow shapes. \r\r13.8.1 BLOW MOLDING \rBlow molding is a molding process in which air pressure is used to in\ufb02ate soft plastic inside a mold cavity. It is an important industrial process for making one-piece hollow plastic parts with thin walls, such as bottles and similar containers. Because many of these items are used for consumer beverages for mass markets, production is typically organized for very high quantities. The technology is borrowed from the glass industry (Section 12.2.1) with which plastics compete in the disposable and recyclable bottle market. \rBlow molding is accomplished in two steps: (1) fabrication of a starting tube of molten plastic, called a parison (same as in glass-blowing); and (2) in\ufb02ation of the tube to the desired \ufb01nal shape. Forming the parison is accomplished by either extrusion or injection molding. \r\r\rExtrusion Blow Molding This form of blow molding consists of the cycle illustrated in Figure 13.31. In most cases, the process is organized as a very high production operation for making plastic bottles. The sequence is automated and often integrated with downstream operations such as bottle \ufb01lling and labeling. \rIt is usually a requirement that the blown container be rigid, and rigidity depends on wall thickness among other factors. The wall thickness of the blown container can be related to the starting extruded parison [12], assuming a cylindrical shape for the \ufb01nal product. The effect of die swell on the parison is shown in Figure 13.32.

On the other hand, larger containers can be produced with extrusion blow molding because the mold in injection molding is so expensive for large parisons.

The resulting structure is more rigid, with higher transparency and better impact resistance. The most widely used material for stretch blow molding is polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a polyester that has very low permeability and is strengthened by the stretch-blow-molding process.The combination of properties makes it ideal as a container for carbonated beverages (e.g., 2-L soda bottles). \rMaterials and Products Blow molding is limited to thermoplastics.

In the latter case, two boat hulls are made in a single blow molding and subsequently cut into two open hulls. \r\r13.8.2 ROTATIONAL MOLDING \rRotational molding uses gravity inside a rotating mold to achieve a hollow form. Also called rotomolding, it is an alternative to blow molding for making large, hollow shapes. It is used principally for thermoplastic polymers, but applications for thermosets and elastomers are becoming more common. Rotomolding tends to favor more complex external geometries, larger parts, and lower production quantities than blow molding. The process consists of the following steps: (1) A predetermined amount of polymer powder is loaded into the cavity of a split mold. (2) The mold is then heated and simultaneously rotated on two perpendicular axes, so that the powder impinges on all internal surfaces of the mold, gradually forming a fused layer of uniform thickness. (3) While still rotating, the mold is cooled so that the plastic skin solidi\ufb01es. (4) The mold is opened, and the part is unloaded. Rotational speeds used in the process are relatively slow. It is gravity, not centrifugal force, that causes uniform coating of the mold surfaces. \rMolds in rotational molding are simple and inexpensive compared to injection molding or blow molding, but the production cycle is much longer, lasting perhaps 10 min or more.To balance these advantages and disadvantages in production,rotational molding is often performed on a multicavity indexing machine, such as the three-station machine shown in Figure 13.36.The machine is designed so that three molds are indexed in sequence through three workstations. Thus, all three molds are working simultaneously. The \ufb01 rst workstation is an unload\u2013load station in which the \ufb01 nished part is unloaded from the mold, and the powder for the next part is loaded into the cavity. The second station consists of a heating chamber where hot-air convection heats the mold while it is simultaneously rotated. Temperatures inside the chamber are around 375\u00b0C (700\u00b0F), depending on the polymer and the \r\rFIGURE 13.36 \rRotational moldingcycle performed on athree-station indexingmachine: (1) unload\u2013load station; (2) heatand rotate mold; (3) coolthe mold. \r\ritem being molded. The third station cools the mold, using forced cold air or water spray, to cool and solidify the plastic molding inside. \rA fascinating variety of articles are made by rotational molding. The list includes hollow toys such as hobby horses and playing balls; boat and canoe hulls, sandboxes, small swimming pools; buoys and other \ufb02otation devices; truck body parts, automotive dashboards, fuel tanks; luggage pieces, furniture, garbage cans; fashion mannequins; large industrial barrels, containers, and storage tanks; portable outhouses, and septic tanks. The most popular molding material is polyethylene, especially HDPE. Other plastics include polypropylene, ABS, and high-impact polystyrene. \r\rThermoforming \rThermoforming is a process in which a \ufb02at thermoplastic sheet is heated and deformed into the desired shape.

The process is widely used to package consumer products and fabricate large items such as bathtubs, contoured skylights, and internal door liners for refrigerators. \rThermoforming consists of two main steps: heating and forming. Heating is usually accomplished by radiant electric heaters, located on one or both sides of the starting plastic sheet at a distance of roughly 125 mm (5 in). Duration of the heating cycle needed to suf\ufb01ciently soften the sheet depends on the polymer\u2014its thickness and color. Methods by which forming is accomplished can be classi\ufb01ed into three basic categories: (1) vacuum thermoforming, (2) pressure thermoforming, and (3) mechanical thermoforming. In the discussion of these methods, the forming of sheet stock is described, but most thermoforming operations in the packaging industry are performed on thin \ufb01lms. \rVacuum Thermoforming This was the \ufb01 rst thermoforming process (simply called vacuum forming when it was developed in the 1950s). Negative pressure \r\r\rFIGURE 13.37 Vacuum thermoforming: (1) a \ufb02 atplastic sheet is softened by heating; (2) thesoftened sheet is placed over a concave mold cavity;\r(3) a vacuum draws the sheet into the cavity;and (4) the plastichardens on contact with the cold mold surface, and the part is removedand subsequentlytrimmed from the web. \ris used to draw a preheated sheet into a mold cavity. The process is explained in Figure 13.37 in its most basic form. The holes for drawing the vacuum in the mold are on the order of 0.8 mm (0.031 in) in diameter, so their effect on the plastic surface is minor. \rPressure Thermoforming An alternative to vacuum forming involves positive pressure to force the heated plastic into the mold cavity. This is called pressure thermoforming or blow forming; its advantage over vacuum forming is that higher pressures can be developed because the latter is limited to a theoretical maximum of 1 atm. Blow-forming pressures of 3 to 4 atm are common. The process sequence is similar to the previous, the difference being that the sheet is pressurized from above into the mold cavity. Vent holes are provided in the mold to exhaust the trapped air. The forming portion of the sequence (steps 2 and 3) is illustrated in Figure 13.38. \rAt this point it is useful to distinguish between negative and positive molds. The molds shown in Figures 13.35 and 13.36 are negative molds because they have concave cavities. A positive mold has a convex shape. Both types are used in thermoforming. In the case of the positive mold, the heated sheet is draped over the convex form and negative or positive pressure is used to force the plastic against the mold surface. A positive mold is shown in Figure 13.39 for vacuum thermoforming. \rThe difference between positive and negative molds may seem unimportant, because the part shapes are the same in the diagrams. However, if the part is drawn \r\r\r(2) sheet is placed over a mold cavity; and (3) positive pressure forces the sheet into the cavity. \rinto the negative mold, then its exterior surface will have the exact surface contour of the mold cavity. The inside surface will be an approximation of the contour and will possess a \ufb01nish corresponding to that of the starting sheet. By contrast, if the sheet is draped over a positive mold, then its interior surface will be identical to that of the convex mold; and its outside surface will follow approximately. Depending on the requirements of the product, this distinction might be important. \rAnother difference is in the thinning of the plastic sheet, one of the problems in thermoforming. Unless the contour of the mold is very shallow, there will be signi\ufb01 cant thinning of the sheet as it is stretched to conform to the mold contour. Positive and negative molds produce a different pattern of thinning in a given part. Consider the tub-shaped part in the \ufb01gures.

As shown in Figure 13.40, the heated plastic sheet is stretched uniformly by vacuum pressure into a spherical shape before drawing it over the mold. \rThe \ufb01rst step depicted in frame (1) of Figure 13.40 can be used alone as a method to produce globe-shaped parts such as skylight windows and transparent domes. In the process, closely controlled air pressure is applied to in\ufb02ate the soft sheet. The pressure is maintained until the blown shape has solidi\ufb01ed. \rMechanical Thermoforming The third method, called mechanical thermoforming, uses matching positive and negative molds that are brought together against the heated plastic sheet, forcing it to assume their shape. In pure mechanical forming, air pressure is not used at all. The process is illustrated in Figure 13.41. Its advantages are better dimensional control and the opportunity for surface detailing on both sides of the part. The disadvantage is that two mold halves are required; therefore, the molds for the other two methods are less costly. \r\r\r\rApplications Thermoforming is a secondary shaping process, the primary process being that which produces the sheet or \ufb01lm (Section 13.3). Only thermoplastics can be thermoformed, because sheets of thermosetting or elastomeric polymers have already been cross-linked during forming and cannot be softened by reheating. Common thermoforming plastics are polystyrene, cellulose acetate and cellulose acetate butyrate, ABS, PVC, acrylic (polymethylmethacrylate), polyethylene, and polypropylene. \rMass production thermoforming operations are performed in the packaging industry.The starting sheet or \ufb01lm is rapidly fed through a heating chamber and then mechanically formed into the desired shape. The operations are often designed to produce multiple parts with each stroke of the press using molds with multiple cavities. In some cases, the extrusion machine that produces the sheet or \ufb01lm is located directly upstream from the thermoforming process, thereby eliminating the need to reheat the plastic. For best ef\ufb01ciency, the \ufb01lling process to put the consumable food item into the container is placed immediately downstream from thermoforming. \rThin \ufb01lm packaging items that are mass produced by thermoforming include blister packs and skin packs.

Thermoforming applications include large parts that can be produced from thicker sheet stock. Examples include covers for business machines, boat hulls, shower stalls, diffusers for lights, advertising displays and signs, bathtubs, and certain toys. Contoured skylights and internal door liners for refrigerators are made, respectively, out of acrylic (because of its transparency) and ABS (because of its ease in forming and resistance to oils and fats found in refrigerators). \rCasting \rIn polymer shaping, casting involves pouring of a liquid resin into a mold, using gravity to \ufb01ll the cavity, and allowing the polymer to harden. Both thermoplastics and thermosets are cast. Examples of the former include acrylics, polystyrene, polyamides (nylons), and vinyls (PVC). Conversion of the liquid resin into a hardened thermoplastic can be accomplished in several ways, which include (1) heating the thermoplastic resin to a highly \ufb02uid state so that it readily pours and \ufb01lls the mold cavity, and then permitting it to cool and solidify in the mold; (2) using a low-molecular-weight prepolymer (or monomer) and polymerizing it in the mold to form a highmolecular-weight thermoplastic; and (3) pouring a plastisol (a liquid suspension of \ufb01ne particles of a thermoplastic resin such as PVC in a plasticizer) into a heated mold so that it gels and solidi\ufb01es. \rThermosetting polymers shaped by casting include polyurethane, unsaturated polyesters, phenolics, and epoxies. The process involves pouring the liquid ingredients that form the thermoset into a mold so that polymerization and cross-linking occur. Heat and/or catalysts may be required depending on the resin system. The reactions must be suf\ufb01ciently slow to allow mold pouring to be completed. Fast-reacting thermosetting systems, such as certain polyurethane systems, require alternative shaping processes like reaction injection molding (Section 13.6.5). \r\rAdvantages of casting over alternative processes such as injection molding include (1) the mold is simpler and less costly, (2) the cast item is relatively free of residual stresses and viscoelastic memory, and (3) the process is suited to low production quantities. Focusing on advantage (2), acrylic sheets (Plexiglas, Lucite) are generally cast between two pieces of highly polished plate glass. The casting process permits a high degree of \ufb02atness and desirable optical qualities to be achieved in the clear plastic sheets. Such \ufb02atness and clarity cannot be obtained by \ufb02at sheet extrusion. A disadvantage in some applications is signi\ufb01cant shrinkage of the cast part during solidi\ufb01cation. For example, acrylic sheets undergo a volumetric contraction of about 20% when cast. This is much more than in injection molding in which high pressures are used to pack the mold cavity to reduce shrinkage. \rSlush casting is an alternative to conventional casting, borrowed from metal casting technology. In slush casting, a liquid plastisol is poured into the cavity of a heated split mold, so that a skin forms at the surface of the mold.

Other terms used for polymer foams include cellular polymer, blown polymer, and expanded polymer.The most common polymer foams are polystyrene (Styrofoam) and polyurethane. Other polymers used to make foams include natural rubber (\u201cfoamed rubber\u201d) and polyvinylchloride (PVC). \rThe characteristic properties of a foamed polymer include (1) low density, (2) high strength per unit weight, (3) good thermal insulation, and (4) good energy absorbing qualities.The elasticity of the base polymer determines the corresponding property of the foam. Polymer foams can be classi\ufb01ed [6] as (1) elastomeric, in which the matrix polymer is a rubber, capable of large elastic deformation; (2) \ufb02 exible, in which the matrix is a highly plasticized polymer such as soft PVC; and (3) rigid, in which the polymer is a stiff thermoplastic such as polystyrene or a thermosetting plastic such as a phenolic. Depending on chemical formulation and degree of cross-linking, polyurethanes can range over all three categories. \rThe characteristic properties of polymer foams, and the ability to control their elastic behavior through selection of the base polymer, make these materials highly suitable for certain types of applications, including hot beverage cups, heat insulating structural materials and cores for structural panels, packaging materials, cushion materials for furniture and bedding, padding for automobile dashboards, and products requiring buoyancy. \rCommon gases used in polymer foams are air, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. The proportion of gas can range up to 90% or more. The gas is introduced into the polymer by several methods, called foaming processes. These include (1) mixing a liquid resin with air by mechanical agitation, then hardening the polymer by means of heat or chemical reaction; (2) mixing a physical blowing agent with the polymer\u2014a gas such as nitrogen (N2) or pentane (C5H12), which can be dissolved in the polymer melt under pressure, so that the gas comes out of solution and expands when the pressure is subsequently reduced; and (3) mixing the polymer with chemical compounds, called chemical blowing agents, that decompose at elevated temperatures to liberate gases such as CO2 or N2 within the melt. \r\r\rThe way the gas is distributed throughout the polymer matrix distinguishes two basic foam structures, illustrated in Figure 13.42: (a) closed cell, in which the gas pores are roughly spherical and completely separated from each other by the polymer matrix; and (b) open cell, in which the pores are interconnected to some extent, allowing passage of a \ufb02uid through the foam.A closed cell structure makes a satisfactory life jacket; an open cell structure would become waterlogged. Other attributes that characterize the structure include the relative proportions of polymer and gas (already mentioned) and the cell density (number of cells per unit volume) which is inversely related to the size of the individual air cells in the foam. \rThere are many shaping processes for polymer foam products. Because the two most important foams are polystyrene and polyurethane, this discussion is limited to shaping processes for these two materials. Polystyrene is a thermoplastic and polyurethane can be either a thermoset or an elastomer, so the processes covered here for these two materials are representative of those used for other polymer foams. \rPolystyrene foams are shaped by extrusion and molding.

In extrusion, a physical or chemical blowing agent is fed into the polymer melt near the die end of the extruder barrel; thus, the extrudate consists of the expanded polymer. Large sheets and boards are made in this way and are subsequently cut to size for heat insulation panels and sections. \rSeveral molding processes are available for polystyrene foam. Structural foam molding and sandwich molding are discussed in Section 13.6.5. A more widely used process is expandable foam molding, in which the molding material usually consists of prefoamed polystyrene beads. The prefoamed beads are produced from pellets of solid polystyrene that have been impregnated with a physical blowing agent. Prefoaming is performed in a large tank by applying steam heat to partially expand the pellets,simultaneously agitating them to prevent fusion.Then,in the molding process, the prefoamed beads are fed into a mold cavity, where they are further expanded and fused together to form the molded product. Hot beverage cups of polystyrene foam are produced in this way. In some processes, the prefoaming step is omitted, and the impregnated beads are fed directly into the mold cavity where they are heated, expanded, and fused. In other operations, the expandable foam is \ufb01 rst formed into a \ufb02at sheet by the blown-\ufb01 lm extrusion process (Section 13.3) and then shaped by thermoforming (Section 13.9) into packaging containers such as egg cartons. \rPolyurethane foam products are made in a one-step process in which the two liquid ingredients (polyol and isocyanate) are mixed and immediately fed into a mold or other form, so that the polymer is synthesized and the part geometry is created at the same time. Shaping processes for polyurethane foam can be divided into two basic types [11]: spraying and pouring. Spraying involves use of a spray gun into which the two ingredients are continuously fed, mixed, and then sprayed onto a target surface. The reactions leading to polymerization and foaming occur after application on the surface. This method is used to apply rigid insulating foams onto construction panels, railway cars, and similar large items. Pouring involves dispensing the ingredients from a mixing head into an open or closed mold in which the reactions occur.An open mold can be a container with the required contour (e.g.,for an automobile seat cushion) or a long channel that is slowly moved past the pouring spout to make long, continuous sections of foam. The closed mold is a completely enclosed cavity into which a certain amount of the mixture is dispensed. Expansion of the reactants completely \ufb01lls the cavity to shape the part. For fast-reacting polyurethanes, the mixture must be rapidly injected into the mold cavity using reaction injection molding (Section 13.6.5). The degree of cross-linking, controlled by the starting ingredients, determines the relative stiffness of the resulting foam. \r\rProduct Design Considerations \rPlastics are an important design material, but the designer must be aware of their limitations. This section lists design guidelines for plastic components, beginning with those that apply in general, and then ones applicable to extrusion and molding (injection molding, compression molding, and transfer molding). \rSeveral general guidelines apply, irrespective of the shaping process. They are mostly limitations of plastic materials that must be considered by the designer. \r\u27a2 \rStrength and stiffness. Plastics are not as strong or stiff as metals. They should not be used in applications in which high stresses will be encountered. Creep resistance is also a limitation. Strength properties vary signi\ufb01cantly among plastics, and strength-to-weight ratios for some plastics are competitive with metals in certain applications. \r\r\u27a2 \rImpact resistance. The capacity of plastics to absorb impact is generally good; plastics compare favorably with most metals. \r\r\u27a2 \rService temperatures of plastics are limited relative to engineering metals and ceramics. \r\r\u27a2 \rThermal expansion is greater for plastics than for metals, so dimensional changes resulting from temperature variations are much more signi\ufb01 cant than for metals.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 92959, "end_char_idx": 97592, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8962ebef-75fb-4825-bb57-8f687340f944": {"__data__": {"id_": "8962ebef-75fb-4825-bb57-8f687340f944", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f7c375a7-9619-41c9-99e8-a5a20e19e9b8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4fd7d4c194b6dbc7df7e77c4a1cc0cb2aa758d568ee5a2373b3885724077eee6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e9826c89-6069-4e42-835e-db990dd0e584", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec13.txt", "file_name": "sec13.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 102161, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "5bdea8e6b7438bb51a858c7afb8421016dcedcc9af1af0ea43418100e8d7be1d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d89a9c8d-508b-4661-a472-fb884196d97e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cdd1494c0ef09544083dc0f219257c8f50c35e9c6de70f141f40e11a176ac7d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Several general guidelines apply, irrespective of the shaping process.

Also, some plastics degrade in oxygen and ozone atmospheres. Finally, plastics are soluble in many common solvents. On the positive side, plastics are resistant to conventional corrosion mechanisms that af\ufb02ict many metals. The weaknesses of speci\ufb01c plastics must be taken into account by the designer. \r\r\rExtrusion is one of the most widely used plastic shaping processes. Several design \rrecommendations are presented here for conventional extrusion (compiled mostly \rfrom [3]). \r\r\u27a2 \rWall thickness. Uniform wall thickness is desirable in an extruded cross section. Variations in wall thickness result in nonuniform plastic \ufb02ow and uneven cooling that tend to warp the extrudate. \r\r\u27a2 \rHollow sections. Hollow sections complicate die design and plastic \ufb02ow. It is desirable to use extruded cross sections that are not hollow yet satisfy functional requirements. \r\r\u27a2 \rCorners. Sharp corners, inside and outside, should be avoided in the cross section, because they result in uneven \ufb02 ow during processing and stress concentrations in the \ufb01 nal product. \r\r\rThe following guidelines apply to injection molding (the most popular molding \rprocess), compression molding, and transfer molding (compiled from Bralla [3], \rMcCrum [10], and other sources). \r\u27a2 \rEconomic production quantities. Each molded part requires a unique mold, and the mold for any of these processes can be costly, particularly for injection molding. Minimum production quantities for injection molding are usually around 10,000 pieces; for compression molding, minimum quantities are around 1000 parts, because of the simpler mold designs involved. Transfer molding lies between the other two. \r\r\u27a2 \rPart complexity. Although more complex part geometries mean more costly molds, it may nevertheless be economical to design a complex molding if the alternative involves many individual components assembled together. An advantage of plastic molding is that it allows multiple functional features to be combined into one part. \r\r\u27a2 \rWall thickness. Thick cross sections are generally undesirable; they are wasteful of material, more likely to cause warping caused by shrinkage, and take longer to harden. Reinforcing ribs can be used in molded plastic parts to achieve increased stiffness without excessive wall thickness. The ribs should be made thinner than the walls they reinforce, to minimize sink marks on the outside wall. \r\r\u27a2 \rCorner radii and \ufb01 llets. Sharp corners, both external and internal, are undesirable in molded parts; they interrupt smooth \ufb02ow of the melt, tend to create surface defects, and cause stress concentrations in the \ufb01nished part. \r\r\u27a2 \rHoles. Holes are quite feasible in plastic moldings, but they complicate mold design and part removal. They also cause interruptions in melt \ufb02ow. \r\r\u27a2 \rDraft. A molded part should be designed with a draft on its sides to facilitate removal from the mold. This is especially important on the inside wall of a cup-shaped part because the molded plastic contracts against the positive mold shape.

Many of the processes used for these materials are the same as or similar to those used for plastics (Chapter 13). After all, polymer matrix composites and rubbers are polymeric materials.The difference is that they contain some form of reinforcing ingredient.A polymer matrix composite (PMC) is a composite material consisting of a polymer embedded with a reinforcing phase such as \ufb01bers or powders. The technological and commercial importance of PMC processes derives from the growing use of this class of material, especially \ufb01berreinforced polymers (FRPs). In popular usage, PMC generally refers to \ufb01ber-reinforced polymers. FRP composites can be designed with very high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios. These features make them attractive in aircraft, cars, trucks, boats, and sports equipment. \rThe preceding de\ufb01nition of a polymer matrix composite could be applied to nearly all rubber products, except that the polymer is an elastomer whereas the polymer in a PMC is a plastic. Almost all rubber products are reinforced with carbon black, which is what gives pneumatic tires their characteristic black color. Tires are the dominant product in the rubber industry. They are used in large numbers for automobiles, trucks, aircraft, and bicycles. \rThe coverage in this chapter begins with PMCs that are based on plastics. Sections 14.5 and 14.6 cover composites based on elastomers. \r\r\r\r\r\rOverview of PMC Processing \rThe variety of shaping methods for \ufb01ber-reinforced polymers can be bewildering on \ufb01rst reading. A road map will be helpful to the reader entering this new territory. FRP composite shaping processes can be divided into \ufb01ve categories, as organized in Figure 14.1: (1) open mold processes, (2) closed mold processes, (3) \ufb01 lament winding, \r(4) pultrusion processes, and (5) miscellaneous. Open mold processes include some of the original manual procedures for laying resins and \ufb01bers onto forms. Closed mold processes are much the same as those used in plastic molding; the reader will recognize the names\u2014compression molding, transfer molding, and injection molding\u2014although the names are sometimes changed and modi\ufb01cations are sometimes made for PMCs. In \ufb01 lament winding, continuous \ufb01laments that have been dipped in liquid resin are wrapped around a rotating mandrel; when the resin cures, a rigid, hollow, generally cylindrical shape is created. Pultrusion is a shaping process for producing long, straight sections of constant cross section; it is similar to extrusion, but adapted to include continuous \ufb01ber reinforcement.The \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d category includes several operations that do not \ufb01t into the previous categories. To complicate matters, some of the processes in the list are used to shape composites with continuous \ufb01bers, whereas others are used for short \ufb01ber PMCs.

In general, techniques for shaping composites are less ef\ufb01cient than manufacturing processes for other materials.There are two reasons for this:(1) composite materials are more complex than other materials, consisting as they do of two or more phases and the need to orient the reinforcing phase in the case of \ufb01ber-reinforced plastics; and (2) processing technologies for composites have not been the object of improvement and re\ufb01nement over as many years as processes for other materials. \r14.1.1 STARTING MATERIALS FOR PMCs \rIn a PMC, the starting materials are a polymer and a reinforcing phase. They are processed separately before becoming phases in the composite. This section considers how these materials are produced before being combined. Section 14.1.2 describes how they are combined to make the composite part. \rBoth thermoplastics and thermosets are used as matrices in PMCs.Thermosetting (TS) polymers are the most common matrix materials. The principal TS polymers are phenolics, unsaturated polyesters, and epoxies. Phenolics are associated with the use of particulate reinforcing phases, whereas polyesters and epoxies are more closely associated with FRPs. Thermoplastic (TP) polymers are also used in PMCs, in fact, most TP molding compounds are composite materials because they include \ufb01llers and/or reinforcing agents. Many of the polymer shaping processes discussed in Chapter 13 are applicable to polymer matrix composites. However, combining the polymer with the reinforcing agent sometimes complicates the operations. \rThe reinforcing phase can be any of several geometries and materials. The geometries include \ufb01bers, particles, and \ufb02akes, and the materials are ceramics, metals, other polymers, or elements such as carbon or boron. The role of the reinforcing phase and some of its technical features are discussed in Section 9.1.2. \rCommon \ufb01ber materials in FRPs are glass, carbon, and the polymer Kevlar. Fibers of these materials are produced by various techniques, some of which have been covered in other chapters. Glass \ufb01bers are produced by drawing through small ori\ufb01ces (Section 12.2.3). For carbon, a series of heating treatments is performed to convert a precursor \ufb01lament containing a carbon compound into a more pure carbon form. The precursor can be any of several substances, including polyacrylonitrile (PAN), pitch (a black carbon resin formed in the distillation of coal tar, wood tar, petroleum, etc.), or rayon (cellulose). Kevlar \ufb01bers are produced by extrusion combined with drawing through small ori\ufb01ces in a spinneret (Section 13.4). \rStarting as continuous \ufb01laments, the \ufb01bers are combined with the polymer matrix in any of several forms, depending on the properties desired in the material and the processing method to be used to shape the composite. In some fabrication processes, the \ufb01laments are continuous, whereas in others, they are chopped into short lengths. In the continuous form, individual \ufb01laments are usually available as rovings. A roving is a collection of untwisted (parallel) continuous strands; this is a convenient form for handling and processing. Rovings typically contain from 12 to 120 individual strands. By contrast, a yarn is a twisted collection of \ufb01laments. Continuous rovings are used in several PMC processes, including \ufb01lament winding and pultrusion. \rThe most familiar form of continuous \ufb01ber is a cloth\u2014a fabric of woven yarns.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3234, "end_char_idx": 7494, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d82e10ec-cb34-42d9-a7bb-cdd835da1eec": {"__data__": {"id_": "d82e10ec-cb34-42d9-a7bb-cdd835da1eec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec14.txt", "file_name": "sec14.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 69128, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cdcaf3b0-1505-4d46-b397-05f33a78b2ea", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec14.txt", "file_name": "sec14.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 69128, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "46bca86eed209cec15a793acc47778fd76f2b996fd9a0520c452db1f56e99461", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "487668fa-415b-45c0-b3b6-df4c96a58f66", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec14.txt", "file_name": "sec14.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 69128, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "065533ab4a8858e8d7d3c8c4e7c4dda72a6f403c629b9b2a2a9f0683c3eca72b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "614de37e-9901-4eb5-ab56-836a2c24e5f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ea3cacdae33722d59eec7e0915d5c275f60f472b2dc92ae5f049d48c1877c1e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Starting as continuous \ufb01laments, the \ufb01bers are combined with the polymer matrix in any of several forms, depending on the properties desired in the material and the processing method to be used to shape the composite.

Very similar to a cloth, but distinguished here, is a woven roving, a fabric consisting of untwisted \ufb01laments rather than yarns. Woven rovings can be produced with unequal numbers of strands in the two directions so that they possess greater strength in one direction than the other. Such unidirectional woven rovings are often preferred in laminated FRP composites. \rFibers can also be prepared in the form of a mat\u2014a felt consisting of randomly oriented short \ufb01bers held loosely together with a binder, sometimes in a carrier fabric. Mats are commercially available as blankets of various weights, thicknesses, and widths. Mats can be cut and shaped for use as preforms in some of the closed mold processes. During molding, the resin impregnates the preform and then cures, thus yielding a \ufb01ber-reinforced molding. \rParticles and \ufb02akes are really in the same class. Flakes are particles whose length and width are large relative to thickness. These and other issues on characterization of engineering powders are discussed in Section 15.1. Production methods for metal powders are discussed in Section 15.2, and techniques for producing ceramic powders are discussed in Section 16.1.1. \r\r\r14.1.2 COMBINING MATRIX AND REINFORCEMENT \rIncorporation of the reinforcing agent into the polymer matrix either occurs during the shaping process or beforehand. In the \ufb01rst case, the starting materials arrive at the fabricating operation as separate entities and are combined into the composite during shaping. Examples of this case are \ufb01 lament winding and pultrusion. The starting reinforcement in these processes consists of continuous \ufb01bers. In the second case, the two component materials are combined into some preliminary form that is convenient for use in the shaping process. Nearly all of the thermoplastics and thermosets used in plastic shaping processes are really polymers combined with \ufb01llers (Section 8.1.5).The \ufb01llers are either short \ufb01bers or particulate (including \ufb02akes). \rOf greatest interest in this chapter are the starting forms used in processes designed for FRP composites. One might think of the starting forms as prefabricated composites that arrive ready for use at the shaping process.These forms are molding compounds and prepregs. \rMolding Compounds Molding compounds are similar to those used in plastic molding.They are designed for use in molding operations,and so they must be capable of \ufb02owing. Most molding compounds for composite processing are thermosetting polymers. Accordingly, they have not been cured before shape processing. Curing is done during and/or after \ufb01nal shaping. FRP composite molding compounds consist of the resin matrix with short,randomly dispersed \ufb01bers.They come in several forms. \rSheet molding compound (SMC) is a combination of TS polymer resin, \ufb01llers and other additives, and chopped glass \ufb01bers (randomly oriented) all rolled into a sheet of typical thickness 6.5 mm (0.250 in). The most common resin is unsaturated polyester; \ufb01llers are usually mineral powders such as talc, silica, limestone; and the glass \ufb01bers are typically 12 to 75 mm (0.5\u20133.0 in) long and account for about 30% of the SMC by volume. SMCs are very convenient for handling and cutting to proper size as molding charges.

The \ufb01bers in BMC are shorter, typically 2 to 12 mm (0.1\u20130.5 in), because greater \ufb02uidity is required in \r\rFIGURE 14.2 Process for producing sheetmolding compound(SMC). \rthe molding operations for which these materials are designed. Billet diameter is usually 25 to 50 mm (1\u20132 in). The process for producing BMC is similar to that for SMC, except extrusion is used to obtain the \ufb01nal billet form. BMC is also known as dough molding compound (DMC), because of its dough-like consistency. Other FRP molding compounds include thick molding compound (TMC), similar to SMC but thicker\u2014up to 50 mm (2 in); and pelletized molding compounds\u2014basically conventional plastic molding compounds containing short \ufb01bers. \rPrepregs Another prefabricated form for FRP shaping operations is prepreg, which consists of \ufb01bers impregnated with partially cured thermosetting resins to facilitate shape processing. Completion of curing must be accomplished during and/ or after shaping. Prepregs are available in the form of tapes or cross-plied sheets or fabrics. The advantage of prepregs is that they are fabricated with continuous \ufb01laments rather than chopped random \ufb01bers, thus increasing strength and modulus of the \ufb01nal product. Prepreg tapes and sheets are associated with advanced composites (reinforced with boron, carbon/graphite, and Kevlar) as well as \ufb01berglass. \r\r\r14.2 Open Mold Processes \rThe distinguishing feature of this family of FRP shaping processes is its use of a single positive or negative mold surface (Figure 14.3) to produce laminated FRP structures. Other names for open mold processes include contact lamination and contact molding. The starting materials (resins, \ufb01 bers, mats, and woven rovings) are applied to the mold in layers, building up to the desired thickness. This is followed by curing and part removal. Common resins are unsaturated polyesters and epoxies, using \ufb01berglass as the reinforcement.The moldings are usually large (e.g.,boat hulls). The advantage of using an open mold is that the mold costs much less than if two \rFIGURE 14.3 Types of open mold: (a) positive and\r(b) negative. \rmatching molds were used. The disadvantage is that only the part surface in contact with the mold surface is \ufb01 nished; the other side is rough. For the best possible part surface on the \ufb01 nished side, the mold itself must be very smooth. \rThere are several important open mold FRP processes. The differences are in \rthe methods of applying the laminations to the mold, alternative curing techniques, \rand other variations. In this section, three open mold processes for shaping \ufb01 ber\rreinforced plastics are described: (1) hand lay-up, (2) spray-up, and (3) automated \rtape-laying machines.

Hand lay-up is treated as the base process and the others as \rmodi\ufb01 cations and re\ufb01 nements. \r\r14.2.1 HAND LAY-UP \rHand lay-up is the oldest open mold method for FRP laminates, dating to the 1940s when it was \ufb01 rst used to fabricate boat hulls. It is also the most labor-intensive method. As the name suggests, hand lay-up is a shaping method in which successive layers of resin and reinforcement are manually applied to an open mold to build the laminated FRP composite structure. The basic procedure consists of \ufb01 ve steps, illustrated in Figure 14.4. The \ufb01 nished molding must usually be trimmed with a power saw to size the outside edges. In general, these same \ufb01 ve steps are required for all of the open mold processes; the differences between methods occurring in steps 3 and 4. \rIn step 3 of the hand lay-up process, each layer of \ufb01 ber reinforcement is dry when placed onto the mold. The liquid (uncured) resin is then applied by pouring, brushing, or spraying. Impregnation of resin into the \ufb01 ber mat or fabric is accomplished by hand rolling. This approach is referred to as wet lay-up. An alternative approach is to use prepregs, in which the impregnated layers of \ufb01 ber reinforcement are \ufb01 rst prepared outside the mold and then laid onto the mold surface. Advantages cited for the prepregs include closer control over \ufb01 ber-resin mixture and more ef\ufb01 cient methods of adding the laminations [16]. \rFIGURE 14.4 Hand lay-up procedure:\r(1)\r mold is cleaned and treated with a mold  release agent; (2) a thin gel coat (resin, possiblypigmented to color)is applied, which will become the  outside surface of the molding;\r\r(3)\r when the gel coathas partially set, successive layers of resin and \ufb01 ber are  applied, the \ufb01 ber being in the form ofmat or cloth; each layer is rolled to fully impregnate the \ufb01 ber with resin and remove air bubbles; (4) the partis cured; and (5) thefully hardened part isremoved from the mold. \r\r\r\rMolds for open mold contact laminating can be made of plaster, metal, glass \ufb01ber\u2013reinforced plastic, or other materials. Selection of material depends on economics, surface quality, and other technical factors. For prototype fabrication, in which only one part is produced, plaster molds are usually adequate. For medium quantities, the mold can be made of \ufb01berglass-reinforced plastic. High production generally requires metal molds. Aluminum, steel, and nickel are used, sometimes with surface hardening on the mold face to resist wear. An advantage of metal, in addition to durability, is its high thermal conductivity that can be used to implement a heat-curing system, or simply to dissipate heat from the laminate while it cures at room temperature. \rProducts suited to hand lay-up are generally large in size but low in production quantity. In addition to boat hulls, other applications include swimming pools, large container tanks, stage props, radomes, and other formed sheets. Automotive parts have also been made, but the method is not economical for high production. The largest moldings ever made by this process were ship hulls for the British Royal Navy: 85 m (280 ft) long [3]. \r\r14.2.2 SPRAY-UP \rThis represents an attempt to mechanize the application of resin-\ufb01ber layers and to reduce the time for lay-up.

It is an alternative for step 3 in the hand lay-up procedure. In the spray-up method, liquid resin and chopped \ufb01bers are sprayed onto an open mold to build successive FRP laminations, as in Figure 14.5. The spray gun is equipped with a chopper mechanism that feeds in continuous \ufb01lament rovings and cuts them into \ufb01bers of length 25 to 75 mm (1\u20133 in) that are added to the resin stream as it exits the nozzle. The mixing action results in random orientation of the \ufb01bers in the layer\u2014unlike hand lay-up, in which the \ufb01laments can be oriented if desired. Another difference is that the \ufb01ber content in spray-up is limited to about 35%, compared with a maximum of around 65% in hand lay-up. This is a shortcoming of the spraying and mixing process. \rSpraying can be accomplished manually using a portable spray gun or by an automated machine in which the path of the spray gun is preprogrammed and computer controlled. The automated procedure is advantageous for labor ef\ufb01ciency and environmental protection. Some of the volatile emissions from the liquid resins are hazardous, and the path-controlled machines can operate in sealed-off areas without \rFIGURE 14.5 Spray-upmethod. \rhumans present. However, rolling is generally required for each layer, as in hand lay-up. \rProducts made by the spray-up method include boat hulls, bathtubs, shower stalls, automobile and truck body parts, recreational vehicle components, furniture, large structural panels, and containers. Movie and stage props are sometimes made by this method. Because products made by spray-up have randomly oriented short \ufb01bers, they are not as strong as those made by lay-up, in which the \ufb01bers are continuous and directed. \r\r\r14.2.3 AUTOMATED TAPE-LAYING MACHINES \rThis is another attempt to automate and accelerate step 3 in the lay-up procedure. Automated tape-laying machines operate by dispensing a prepreg tape onto an open mold following a programmed path. The typical machine consists of an overhead gantry, to which is attached the dispensing head, as shown in Figure 14.6. The gantry permits x-y-z travel of the head, for positioning and following a de\ufb01 ned continuous path. The head itself has several rotational axes, plus a shearing device to cut the tape at the end of each path. Prepreg tape widths are commonly 75 mm (3 in), although 300 mm (12 in) widths have been reported [15]; thickness is around \r0.13 mm (0.005 in). The tape is stored on the machine in rolls, which are unwound and deposited along the de\ufb01ned path. Each lamination is placed by following a series of back-and-forth passes across the mold surface until the parallel rows of tape complete the layer. \rMuch of the work to develop automated tape-laying machines has been pioneered by the aircraft industry, which is eager to save labor costs and at the same time achieve the highest possible quality and uniformity in its manufactured components.The disadvantage of this and other computer numerically controlled machines is that it must be programmed, and programming takes time. \r\rFIGURE 14.6 \rAutomated tape-layingmachine.

In some cases, days are required before room temperature curing is suf\ufb01ciently complete to remove the part. If feasible, heat is added to speed the curing reaction. \rHeating is accomplished by several means. Oven curing provides heat at closely controlled temperatures; some curing ovens are equipped to draw a partial vacuum. Infrared heating can be used in applications in which it is impractical or inconvenient to place the molding in an oven. \rCuring in an autoclave provides control over both temperature and pressure. An autoclave is an enclosed chamber equipped to apply heat and/or pressure at controlled levels. In FRP composites processing, it is usually a large horizontal cylinder with doors at either end. The term autoclave molding is sometimes used to refer to the curing of a prepreg laminate in an autoclave.This procedure is used extensively in the aerospace industry to produce advanced composite components of very high quality. \r\r\r\rClosed Mold Processes \rThese molding operations are performed in molds consisting of two sections that open and close during each molding cycle. One might think that a closed mold is about twice the cost of a comparable open mold. However, tooling cost is even greater owing to the more complex equipment required in these processes. Despite their higher cost, advantages of a closed mold are (1) good \ufb01nish on all part surfaces, \r(2) higher production rates, (3) closer control over tolerances, and (4) more complex three-dimensional shapes are possible. \rThe closed mold processes are divided into three classes based on their counterparts in conventional plastic molding, even though the terminology is often different when polymer matrix composites are molded: (1) compression molding, (2) transfer molding, and (3) injection molding. \r14.3.1 COMPRESSION MOLDING PMC PROCESSES \rIn compression molding of conventional molding compounds (Section 13.7.1), a charge is placed in the lower mold section, and the sections are brought together under pressure, causing the charge to take the shape of the cavity. The mold halves are heated to cure the thermosetting polymer. When the molding is suf\ufb01ciently cured, the mold is opened and the part is removed. There are several shaping processes for PMCs based on compression molding; the differences are mostly in the form of the starting materials. The \ufb02ow of the resin, \ufb01bers, and other ingredients during the process is a critical factor in compression molding of FRP composites. \rSMC, TMC, and BMC Molding Several of the FRP molding compounds, namely sheet molding compound (SMC), bulk molding compound (BMC), and thick molding compound (TMC), can be cut to proper size and used as the starting charge in \rFIGURE 14.7 Elastic reservoir molding: (1) foam is placed into mold between two \ufb01ber layers; (2) mold is closed, releasing resin from foam into \ufb01ber layers. \rcompression molding.

Curing produces a lightweight part consisting of a low-density core and thin FRP skins. \r\r\r14.3.2 TRANSFER MOLDING PMC PROCESSES \rIn conventional transfer molding (Section 13.7.2), a charge of thermosetting resin is placed in a pot or chamber, heated, and squeezed by ram action into one or more mold cavities. The mold is heated to cure the resin. The name of the process derives from the fact that the \ufb02uid polymer is transferred from the pot into the mold. It can be used to mold TS resins in which the \ufb01llers include short \ufb01bers to produce an FRP composite part. Another form of transfer molding for PMCs is called resin transfer molding (RTM) [6], [16]; it refers to a closed mold process in which a preform mat is placed in the lower mold section, the mold is closed, and a thermosetting resin (e.g., polyester) is transferred into the cavity under moderate pressure to impregnate the preform. To confuse matters, RTM is sometimes called resin injection molding [6], [18] (the distinction between transfer molding and injection molding is blurry anyway, as the reader may have noted in Chapter 13). RTM has been used to manufacture products such as bathtubs, swimming pool shells, bench and chair seats, and hulls for small boats. \r\rSeveral enhancements of the basic RTM process have been developed [8]. One enhancement, called advanced RTM, uses high-strength polymers such as epoxy resins and continuous \ufb01ber reinforcement instead of mats. Applications include aerospace components, missile \ufb01ns, and snow skis. Two additional processes are thermal expansion resin transfer molding and ultimately reinforced thermoset resin injection. Thermal expansion resin transfer molding (TERTM) is a patented process of TERTM, Inc. that consists of the following steps [8]: (1) A rigid polymer foam (e.g., polyurethane) is shaped into a preform. (2) The preform is enclosed in a fabric reinforcement and placed in a closed mold. (3) A thermosetting resin (e.g., epoxy) is injected into the mold to impregnate the fabric and surround the foam. \r(4) The mold is heated to expand the foam, \ufb01 ll the mold cavity, and cure the resin. Ultimately reinforced thermoset resin injection (URTRI) is similar to TERTM except that the starting foam core is cast epoxy embedded with miniature hollow glass spheres. \r\r14.3.3 INJECTION MOLDING PMC PROCESSES \rInjection molding is noted for low-cost production of plastic parts in large quantities. Although it is most closely associated with thermoplastics, the process can also be adapted to thermosets (Section 13.6.5). \rConventional Injection Molding In PMC shape processing, injection molding is used for both TP- and TS-type FRPs. In the TP category, virtually all thermoplastic polymers can be reinforced with \ufb01bers.

Although it is most closely associated with thermoplastics, the process can also be adapted to thermosets (Section 13.6.5). \rConventional Injection Molding In PMC shape processing, injection molding is used for both TP- and TS-type FRPs. In the TP category, virtually all thermoplastic polymers can be reinforced with \ufb01bers. Chopped \ufb01bers must be used; if continuous \ufb01bers were used, they would be reduced anyway by the action of the rotating screw in the barrel. During injection from the chamber into the mold cavity, the \ufb01bers tend to become aligned during their journey through the nozzle. Designers can sometimes exploit this feature to optimize directional properties through part design, location of gates, and cavity orientation relative to the gate [13]. \rWhereas TP molding compounds are heated and then injected into a cold mold, TS polymers are injected into a heated mold for curing. Control of the process with thermosets is trickier because of the risk of premature cross-linking in the injection chamber. Subject to the same risk, injection molding can be applied to \ufb01ber-reinforced TS plastics in the form of pelletized molding compound and dough molding compound. \rReinforced Reaction Injection Molding Some thermosets cure by chemical reaction rather than heat; these resins can be molded by reaction injection molding (Section 13.6.5). In RIM, two reactive ingredients are mixed and immediately injected into a mold cavity where curing and solidi\ufb01cation of the chemicals occur rapidly. A closely related process includes reinforcing \ufb01bers, typically glass, in the mixture. In this case, the process is called reinforced reaction injection molding (RRIM). Its advantages are similar to those in RIM, with the added bene\ufb01t of \ufb01ber reinforcement. RRIM is used extensively in auto body and truck cab applications for bumpers, fenders, and other body parts. \r14.4\r14.4 \r14.4.1 \r\r\r\rOther PMC Shaping Processes \rThis section describes the remaining categories of PMC shaping processes: \ufb01 lament winding, pultrusion processes, and miscellaneous PMC shaping processes. \r\rFILAMENT WINDING \rFilament winding is a process in which resin-impregnated continuous \ufb01 bers are wrapped around a rotating mandrel that has the internal shape of the desired FRP product. The resin is subsequently cured and the mandrel removed. Hollow axisymmetric components (usually circular in cross section) are produced, as well as some irregular shapes. The most common form of the process is depicted in Figure 14.8. A band of \ufb01 ber rovings is pulled through a resin bath immediately before being wound in a helical pattern onto a cylindrical mandrel. Continuation of the winding pattern \ufb01 nally completes a surface layer of one \ufb01 lament thickness on the mandrel. The operation is repeated to form additional layers, each having a criss-cross pattern with the previous, until the desired part thickness has been obtained. \rThere are several methods by which the \ufb01 bers can be impregnated with resin: \r(1) wet winding, in which the \ufb01 lament is pulled through the liquid resin just before winding, as in the \ufb01 gure; (2) prepreg winding (also called dry winding), in which \ufb01 laments preimpregnated with partially cured resin are wrapped around a heated mandrel; and (3) postimpregnation, in which \ufb01 laments are wound onto a mandrel and then impregnated with resin by brushing or other technique. \rTwo basic winding patterns are used in \ufb01 lament winding: (a) helical and (b) polar (Figure 14.9). In helical winding, the \ufb01 lament band is applied in a spiral pattern around the mandrel, at a helix angle u. If the band is wrapped with a helix angle approaching 90\u00b0, so that the winding advance is one bandwidth per revolution and the \ufb01 laments form nearly circular rings around the mandrel, this is referred to as a hoop winding; it is a special case of helical winding.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 27140, "end_char_idx": 31294, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44b7d23a-2645-4bd8-942e-5e694b919c0e": {"__data__": {"id_": "44b7d23a-2645-4bd8-942e-5e694b919c0e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec14.txt", "file_name": "sec14.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 69128, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cdcaf3b0-1505-4d46-b397-05f33a78b2ea", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec14.txt", "file_name": "sec14.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 69128, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "46bca86eed209cec15a793acc47778fd76f2b996fd9a0520c452db1f56e99461", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "be093b87-2850-4ec3-973b-b2805eff6352", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec14.txt", "file_name": "sec14.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 69128, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "37209ddb668320b8f0adac65b86b067a647030f17ce00c69b6a4b1e6a1993271", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4d80048f-187d-4b77-9f47-96f2b120ea14", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "666ea4b9ded3221ba8c2991b30706c285eae2626882e822ee54ac10bda85c95d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Two basic winding patterns are used in \ufb01 lament winding: (a) helical and (b) polar (Figure 14.9).

The typical machine has a drive motor to rotate the mandrel and a powered feed mechanism to move the carriage. Relative motion between mandrel and carriage must be controlled to accomplish a given winding pattern. In helical winding, the relationship between helix angle and the machine parameters can be expressed as follows: \rvc\rtan u ! (14.1)\rpDN \r\rwhere u ! helix angle of the windings on the mandrel, as in Figure 14.9(a); vc ! speed at which the carriage traverses in the axial direction, m/s (in/sec); D ! diameter of the mandrel, m (in); and N  rotational speed, 1/s (rev/sec). \rVarious types of control are available in \ufb01lament winding machines. Modern equipment uses computer numerical control (CNC, Section 37.3), in which mandrel rotation and carriage speed are independently controlled to permit greater adjustment and \ufb02exibility in the relative motions. CNC is especially useful in helical winding of contoured shapes,as in Figure 14.10.As indicated in Equation (14.1),the ratio vc/DN must remain \ufb01xed to maintain a constant helix angle u. Thus, either vc and/or N must be adjusted on-line to compensate for changes in D. \r\r  Section 14.4/Other PMC Shaping Processes  361  \rThe mandrel is the special tooling that determines the geometry of the \ufb01 lament-wound part. For part removal, mandrels must be capable of collapsing after winding and curing. Various designs are possible, including in\ufb02 atable/de\ufb02 atable mandrels, collapsible metal mandrels, and mandrels made of soluble salts or plasters. Applications of \ufb01 lament winding are often classi\ufb01 ed as aerospace or commercial [15], the engineering requirements being more demanding in the \ufb01 rst category. Aerospace applications include rocket-motor cases, missile bodies, radomes, helicopter blades, and airplane tail sections and stabilizers. These components are made of advanced composites and hybrid composites (Section 9.4.1), with epoxy resins being most common and reinforced with \ufb01 bers of carbon, boron, Kevlar, and glass. Commercial applications include storage tanks, reinforced pipes and tubing, drive shafts, wind-turbine blades, and lightning rods; these are made of conventional FRPs. Polymers include polyester, epoxy, and phenolic resins; glass is the common reinforcing \ufb01 ber.  \r14.4.2  PULTRUSION PROCESSES  \rThe basic pultrusion process was developed around 1950 for making \ufb01 shing rods of glass \ufb01 ber\u2013reinforced polymer (GFRP).

The process is similar to extrusion (hence the similarity in name), but it involves pulling of the workpiece (so the pre\ufb01 x \u201cpul-\u201d is used in place of \u201cex-\u201d). Like extrusion, pultrusion produces continuous, straight sections of constant cross section. A related process, called pulforming, can be used to make parts that are curved and may have variations in cross section throughout their lengths.  \rPultrusion Pultrusion is a process in which continuous \ufb01 ber rovings are dipped into a resin bath and pulled through a shaping die where the impregnated resin cures. The setup is sketched in Figure 14.11, which shows the cured product being cut into long, straight sections. The sections are reinforced throughout their length by continuous \ufb01 bers. Like extrusion, the pieces have a constant cross section, whose pro\ufb01 le is determined by the shape of the die opening.  \r\rFIGURE 14.11 \rPultrusion process (seetext for interpretation ofsequence numbers). \r\rThe process consists of \ufb01ve steps (identi\ufb01ed in the sketch) performed in a continuous sequence [3]: (1) \ufb01 lament feeding, in which the \ufb01bers are unreeled from a creel (shelves with skewers that hold \ufb01lament bobbins); (2) resin impregnation, in which the \ufb01bers are dipped in the uncured liquid resin; (3) pre-die forming\u2014 the collection of \ufb01laments is gradually shaped into the approximate cross section desired; (4) shaping and curing, in which the impregnated \ufb01bers are pulled through the heated die whose length is 1\u20131.5 m (3\u20135 ft) and whose inside surfaces are highly polished; and (5) pulling and cutting\u2014pullers are used to draw the cured length through the die, after which it is cut by a cut-off wheel with SiC or diamond grits. \rCommon resins used in pultrusion are unsaturated polyesters, epoxies, and silicones, all thermosetting polymers. There are dif\ufb01culties in processing with epoxy polymers because of sticking on the die surface.Thermoplastics have also been studied for possible applications [3]. E-glass is by far the most widely used reinforcing material; proportions range from 30% to 70%. Modulus of elasticity and tensile strength increase with reinforcement content. Products made by pultrusion include solid rods, tubing, long and \ufb02at sheets, structural sections (such as channels, angled and \ufb02anged beams), tool handles for high-voltage work, and third-rail covers for subways. \rPulforming The pultrusion process is limited to straight sections of constant cross section. There is also a need for long parts with continuous \ufb01ber reinforcement that are curved rather than straight and whose cross sections may vary throughout the length.The pulforming process is suited to these less-regular shapes. Pulforming can be de\ufb01ned as pultrusion with additional steps to form the length into a semicircular contour and alter the cross section at one or more locations along the length. A sketch of the equipment is illustrated in Figure 14.12. After exiting the shaping die, the continuous workpiece is fed into a rotating table with negative molds positioned around its periphery. The work is forced into the mold cavities by a die shoe, which squeezes the cross section at various locations and forms the curvature in the length. The diameter of the table determines the radius of the part. As the work leaves the die table, it is cut to length to provide discrete parts. Resins and \ufb01bers used in pulforming are similar to those for pultrusion. An important application of the process is production of automobile leaf springs. \rFIGURE 14.12 \rPulforming process(not shown in thesketch is the cut-off of the pulformed part).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 34007, "end_char_idx": 38021, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43674b10-f24a-4b5c-9b17-0a483d5a1c0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "43674b10-f24a-4b5c-9b17-0a483d5a1c0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec14.txt", "file_name": "sec14.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 69128, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cdcaf3b0-1505-4d46-b397-05f33a78b2ea", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec14.txt", "file_name": "sec14.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 69128, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "46bca86eed209cec15a793acc47778fd76f2b996fd9a0520c452db1f56e99461", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4d80048f-187d-4b77-9f47-96f2b120ea14", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec14.txt", "file_name": "sec14.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 69128, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4ecbe2c19304e6b7c7c1b841108821ee8ab14f642588165f5ee1b517aa92d2b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c3eb2f94-d231-428d-a6a3-3e0b66899728", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eca177306f69034fe13965688d5aebdcc0dc1fde901d9c8506b3467bb868fe63", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A sketch of the equipment is illustrated in Figure 14.12.

In addition, many of the traditional thermoplastic shaping processes are applicable to (short-\ufb01ber) FRPs based on TP polymers; these include blow molding, thermoforming, and extrusion. \rCentrifugal Casting This process is ideal for cylindrical products such as pipes and tanks.The process is the same as its counterpart in metal casting (Section 11.3.5). Chopped \ufb01bers combined with liquid resin are poured into a fast-rotating cylindrical mold that is heated. Centrifugal force presses the ingredients against the mold wall, where curing takes place. The resulting inner surfaces of the part are quite smooth. Part shrinkage or use of split molds permits part removal. \rTube Rolling FRP tubes can be fabricated from prepreg sheets by a rolling technique [11], shown in Figure 14.13. Such tubes are used in bicycle frames and space trusses. In the process, a precut prepreg sheet is wrapped around a cylindrical mandrel several times to obtain a tube wall of multiple sheet thicknesses. The rolled sheets are then encased in a heat-shrinking sleeve and oven cured. As the sleeve contracts, entrapped gases are squeezed out the ends of the tube. When curing is complete, the mandrel is removed to yield a rolled FRP tube. The operation is sim-ple,and tooling cost is low.There are variations in the process,such as using different wrapping methods or using a steel mold to enclose the rolled prepreg tube for better dimensional control. \rContinuous Laminating Fiber-reinforced plastic panels, sometimes translucent and/or corrugated,are used in construction.The process to produce them consists of \r(1) impregnating layers of glass \ufb01ber mat or woven fabric by dipping in liquid resin or by passing beneath a doctor blade; (2) gathering between cover \ufb01lms (cellophane, polyester, or other polymer); and (3) compacting between squeeze rolls and curing. Corrugation (4) is added by formed rollers or mold shoes. \rCutting Methods FRP laminated composites must be cut in both uncured and cured states. Uncured materials (prepregs, preforms, SMCs, and other starting forms) must be cut to size for lay-up,molding,and so on.Typical cutting tools include knives, scissors, power shears, and steel-rule blanking dies. Also used are nontraditional cutting methods, such as laser beam cutting and water jet cutting (Chapter 25). \rCured FRPs are hard, tough, abrasive, and dif\ufb01cult to cut; but cutting is necessary in many FRP shaping processes to trim excess material, cut holes and outlines, and so forth.

During its \ufb01rst century, the rubber industry was concerned only with the processing of natural rubber. Around World War II, synthetic rubbers were developed (Historical Note 8.3), and today they account for the majority of rubber production. \rProduction of rubber goods can be divided into two basic steps: (1) production of the rubber itself, and (2) processing of the rubber into \ufb01nished goods. Production of rubber differs, depending on whether it is natural or synthetic. The difference is in the raw materials. Natural rubber (NR) is produced as an agricultural crop, whereas most synthetic rubbers are made from petroleum. \rProduction of rubber is followed by processing into \ufb01nal products; this consists of \r(1) compounding, (2) mixing, (3) shaping, and (4) vulcanizing. Processing techniques for natural and synthetic rubbers are virtually the same, differences being in the chemicals used to effect vulcanization (cross-linking). This sequence does not apply to thermoplastic elastomers, whose shaping techniques are the same as for other thermoplastic polymers. \rThere are several distinct industries involved in the production and processing of rubber. Production of raw natural rubber might be classi\ufb01ed as farming because latex, the starting ingredient for natural rubber, is grown on large plantations located in tropical climates. By contrast, synthetic rubbers are produced by the petrochemical industry. Finally, the processing of these materials into tires, shoe soles, and other rubber products occurs at processor (fabricator) plants. The processors are commonly known as the rubber industry. Some of the great names in this industry include Goodyear, B. F. Goodrich, and Michelin. The importance of the tire is re\ufb02ected in these names. \r14.5.1 PRODUCTION OF RUBBER \rThis section surveys the production of rubber before it goes to the processor, distinguishing between natural rubber and synthetic rubber. \rNatural Rubber Natural rubber is tapped from rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) as latex. The trees are grown on plantations in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world. Latex is a colloidal dispersion of solid particles of the polymer polyisoprene (Section 8.4.2) in water. Polyisoprene is the chemical substance that comprises rubber, and its content in the emulsion is about 30%. The latex is collected in large tanks, thus blending the yield of many trees together. \rThe preferred method of recovering rubber from the latex involves coagulation. The latex is \ufb01rst diluted with water to about half its natural concentration. An acid such as formic acid (HCOOH) or acetic acid (CH3COOH) is added to cause the latex to coagulate after about 12 hours. The coagulum, now in the form of soft solid slabs, is then squeezed through a series of rolls that drive out most of the water and reduce the thickness to about 3 mm (1/8 in).The \ufb01nal rolls have grooves that impart a criss-cross pattern to the resulting sheets. The sheets are then draped over wooden frames and dried in smokehouses. The hot smoke contains creosote, which prevents mildew and oxidation of the rubber. Several days are normally required to complete the drying process. The resulting rubber, now in a form called ribbed smoked sheet is folded into large bales for shipment to the processor. This raw rubber has a characteristic dark brown color. In some cases, the sheets are dried in hot air rather than smokehouses, and the term air-dried sheet is applied; this is considered to be a better grade of rubber. A still better grade, called pale crepe rubber, involves two coagulation steps; the \ufb01rst removes undesirable components of the latex, then the resulting coagulum is subjected to a more involved washing and mechanical working procedure, followed by warm air drying.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 40922, "end_char_idx": 45294, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11750145-1210-4732-93b0-48a45063b406": {"__data__": {"id_": "11750145-1210-4732-93b0-48a45063b406", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec14.txt", "file_name": "sec14.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 69128, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cdcaf3b0-1505-4d46-b397-05f33a78b2ea", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec14.txt", "file_name": "sec14.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 69128, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "46bca86eed209cec15a793acc47778fd76f2b996fd9a0520c452db1f56e99461", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3eb2f94-d231-428d-a6a3-3e0b66899728", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec14.txt", "file_name": "sec14.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 69128, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "60b2d9b37ce54797c7b08c75b2e22180c75913bd82feeb413bcea50e7f49f4ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b8253aa2-ee76-48f3-9868-10ac37d95d78", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "73d90fff9242cc885367241cfcc32889e92250908019cc6b6bf9a82dea857c8b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The sheets are then draped over wooden frames and dried in smokehouses.

The color of pale crepe rubber approaches a light tan. \rSynthetic Rubber The various types of synthetic rubber were identi\ufb01ed in Section \r8.4.3. Most synthetics are produced from petroleum by the same polymerization techniques used to synthesize other polymers (Section 8.1.1). However, unlike thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers, which are normally supplied to the fabricator as pellets or liquid resins, synthetic rubbers are supplied to rubber processors in the form of large bales. The industry has developed a long tradition of handling natural rubber in these unit loads. \r\r\r14.5.2 COMPOUNDING AND MIXING \rRubber is always compounded with additives. It is through compounding that the speci\ufb01c rubber is designed to satisfy a the requirements of a given application in terms of properties, cost, and processability. Compounding adds chemicals for vulcanization. Sulfur has traditionally been used for this purpose. The vulcanization process and the chemicals used to accomplish it are discussed in Section 14.5.4. \rAdditives include \ufb01llers that act either to enhance the rubber\u2019s mechanical properties (reinforcing \ufb01llers) or to extend the rubber to reduce cost (nonreinforcing \ufb01llers). The single most important reinforcing \ufb01ller in rubber is carbon black, a colloidal form of carbon, black in color, obtained from the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons (soot). Its effect is to increase tensile strength and resistance to abrasion and tearing of the \ufb01nal rubber product. Carbon black also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation. These enhancements are especially important in tires. Most rubber parts are black in color because of their carbon black content. \rAlthough carbon black is the most important \ufb01ller, others are also used. They include china clays\u2014hydrous aluminum silicates (Al2Si2O5(OH)4)\u2014which provide less reinforcing than carbon black but are used when the black color is not acceptable; calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which is a nonreinforcing \ufb01ller; silica (SiO2), which can serve reinforcing or nonreinforcing functions depending on particle size; and other polymers, such as styrene, PVC, and phenolics. Reclaimed (recycled) rubber is also added as a \ufb01ller in some rubber products, but usually not in proportions exceeding 10%. \rOther additives compounded with the rubber include antioxidants, to retard aging by oxidation; fatigue- and ozone-protective chemicals; coloring pigments; \r\rFIGURE 14.14 \rMixers used in rubber processing: (a) two-rollmill and (b) Banburytype internal mixer. These machines can also be used for mastication of natural rubber. \r\rplasticizers and softening oils; blowing agents in the production of foamed rubber; and mold-release compounds. \rMany products require \ufb01lament reinforcement to reduce extensibility but retain the other desirable properties of rubber.Tires and conveyor belts are notable examples. Filaments used for this purpose include cellulose, nylon, and polyester. Fiberglass and steel are also used as reinforcements (e.g., steel-belted radial tires). These continuous \ufb01ber materials must be added during the shaping process; they are not mixed with the other additives. \rThe additives must be thoroughly mixed with the base rubber to achieve uniform dispersion of the ingredients. Uncured rubbers possess high viscosity. Mechanical working experienced by the rubber can increase its temperature up to 150\u00b0C (300\u00b0F).

In the \ufb01rst stage, carbon black and other nonvulcanizing additives are combined with the raw rubber. The term masterbatch is used for this \ufb01rst-stage mixture. After thorough mixing has been accomplished, and time for cooling has been allowed, the second stage is carried out in which the vulcanizing agents are added. \rEquipment for mixing includes the two-roll mill and internal mixers such as the Banbury mixer, Figure 14.14. The two-roll mill consists of two parallel rolls, supported in a frame so they can be brought together to obtain a desired \u201cnip\u201d (gap size), and driven to rotate at the same or slightly different speeds. An internal mixer has two rotors enclosed in a casing, as in Figure 14.14(b) for the Banbury-type internal mixer. The rotors have blades and rotate in opposite directions at different speeds, causing a complex \ufb02ow pattern in the contained mixture. \r\r14.5.3 SHAPING AND RELATED PROCESSES \rShaping processes for rubber products can be divided into four basic categories: (1) extrusion, (2) calendering, (3) coating, and (4) molding and casting. Most of these processes are discussed in the previous chapter. Here the special issues that arise when they are applied to rubber are examined. Some products require several basic processes plus assembly work in their manufacture, tires for example. \r\rExtrusion Extrusion of polymers was discussed in the preceding chapter. Screw extruders are generally used for extrusion of rubber. As with extrusion of thermosetting plastics, the L/D ratio of the extruder barrels is less than for thermoplastics, typically in range 10 to 15, to reduce the risk of premature cross-linking. Die swell occurs in rubber extrudates, because the polymer is in a highly plastic condition and exhibits the memory property. It has not yet been vulcanized. \rCalendering This process involves passing rubber stock through a series of gaps of decreasing size made by a stand of rotating rolls (Section 13.3).The rubber process must be operated at lower temperatures than for thermoplastic polymers to avoid premature vulcanization. Also, equipment used in the rubber industry is of heavier construction than that used for thermoplastics, because rubber is more viscous and harder to form. The output of the process is a rubber sheet of thickness determined by the \ufb01nal roll gap; again, swelling occurs in the sheet, causing its thickness to be slightly greater than the gap size. Calendering can also be used to coat or impregnate textile fabrics to produce rubberized fabrics. \rThere are problems in producing thick sheet by either extrusion or calendering. Thickness control is dif\ufb01cult in the former process, and air entrapment occurs in the latter. These problems are largely solved when extrusion and calendering are combined in the roller die process (Figure 14.15).The extruder die is a slit that feeds the calender rolls. \rCoating Coating or impregnating fabrics with rubber is an important process in the rubber industry. These composite materials are used in automobile tires, conveyor belts, in\ufb02atable rafts, and waterproof cloth for tarpaulins, tents, and rain coats. The coating of rubber onto substrate fabrics includes a variety of processes. Calendering is one of the coating methods.

Figure 14.16 illustrates one possible way in which the fabric is fed into the calendering rolls to obtain a reinforced rubber sheet. \r\r\rAlternatives to calendering include skimming, dipping, and spraying. In the skimming process, a thick solution of rubber compound in an organic solvent is applied to the fabric as it is unreeled from a supply spool. The coated fabric passes under a doctor blade that skims the solvent to the proper thickness, and then moves into a steam chamber where the solvent is driven off by heat. As its name suggests, dipping involves temporary immersion of the fabric into a highly \ufb02uid solution of rubber, followed by drying. In spraying, a spray gun is used to apply the rubber solution. \rMolding and Casting Molded articles include shoe soles and heels, gaskets and seals, suction cups, and bottle stops. Many foamed rubber parts are produced by molding. In addition, molding is an important process in tire production. Principal molding processes for rubber are (1) compression molding, (2) transfer molding, and (3) injection molding. Compression molding is the most important technique because of its use in tire manufacture. Curing (vulcanizing) is accomplished in the mold in all three processes, this representing a departure from the shaping methods already discussed, which require a separate vulcanizing step. With injection molding of rubber, there are risks of premature curing similar to those faced in the same process when applied to thermosetting plastics. Advantages of injection molding over traditional methods for producing rubber parts include better dimensional control, less scrap, and shorter cycle times. In addition to its use in the molding of conventional rubbers, injection molding is also applied for thermoplastic elastomers. Because of high mold costs, large production quantities are required to justify injection molding. \rA form of casting, called dip casting, is used for producing rubber gloves and overshoes. It involves submersion of a positive mold in a liquid polymer (or a heated form into plastisol) for a certain duration (the process may involve repeated dippings) to form the desired thickness. The coating is then stripped from the form and cured to cross-link the rubber. \r\r14.5.4 VULCANIZATION \rVulcanization is the treatment that accomplishes cross-linking of elastomer molecules, so that the rubber becomes stiffer and stronger but retains extensibility. It is a critical step in the rubber processing sequence. On a submicroscopic scale, the process can be pictured as in Figure 14.17, in which the long-chain molecules of \rFIGURE 14.17 Effect of vulcanization on the rubber molecules: (1) raw rubber; (2) vulcanized (cross-linked) rubber. Variations of (2) include \r(a) soft rubber, low degree of cross-linking;and (b) hard rubber, high degree of cross-linking. \rLong-chain (a)\r\rCrosslinks \r\r\r\r(b) \r\r\r(1) (2) \r\rthe rubber become joined at certain tie points, the effect of which is to reduce the ability of the elastomer to \ufb02ow.

No other chemicals were included in the process. Vulcanization with sulfur alone is no longer used as a commercial treatment today,because of the long curing times.Various other chemicals,including zinc oxide (ZnO) and stearic acid (C18H36O2), are combined with smaller doses of sulfur to accelerate and strengthen the treatment.The resulting cure time is 15 to 20 minutes for a typical passenger car tire. In addition, various nonsulfur vulcanizing treatments have been developed. \rIn rubber-molding processes, vulcanization is accomplished in the mold by maintaining the mold temperature at the proper level for curing. In the other forming processes,vulcanization is performed after the part has been shaped.The treatments generally divide between batch processes and continuous processes. Batch methods include the use of an autoclave, a steam-heated pressure vessel; and gas curing, in which a heated inert gas such as nitrogen cures the rubber. Many of the basic shaping processes make a continuous product, and if the output is not cut into discrete pieces, continuous vulcanization is appropriate. Continuous methods include high-pressure steam, suited to the curing of rubber coated wire and cable; hot-air tunnel, for cellular extrusions and carpet underlays [5]; and continuous drum cure, in which continuous rubber sheets (e.g., belts and \ufb02ooring materials) pass through one or more heated rolls to effect vulcanization. \r\r\r14.5.5 PROCESSING OF THERMOPLASTIC ELASTOMERS \r\rA thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) is a thermoplastic polymer that possesses the properties of a rubber (Section 8.4.3); the term thermoplastic rubber is also used. TPEs can be processed like thermoplastics, but their applications are those of an elastomer. The most common shaping processes are injection molding and extrusion, which are generally more economical and faster than the traditional processes used for rubbers that must be vulcanized. Molded products include shoe soles, athletic footwear, and automotive components such as fender extensions and corner panels (but not tires\u2014TPEs have been found to be unsatisfactory for that application). Extruded items include insulation coating for electrical wire, tubing for medical applications, conveyor belts, and sheet and \ufb01lm stock. Other shaping techniques for TPEs include blow molding and thermoforming (Sections 13.8 and 13.9); these processes cannot be used for vulcanized rubbers. \r\rManufacture of Tires and Other Rubber Products \rTires are the principal product of the rubber industry, accounting for about three-fourths of total tonnage. Other important products include footwear, hose, conveyor belts, seals, shock-absorbing components, foamed rubber products, and sports equipment. \r\r14.6.1 TIRES \rPneumatic tires are critical components of the vehicles on which they are mounted. They are used on automobiles, trucks, buses, farm tractors, earth-moving equipment, military vehicles, bicycles, motorcycles, and aircraft. Tires support the weight of the vehicle and the passengers and cargo on board; they transmit the motor torque to propel the vehicle (except on aircraft); and they absorb vibrations and shock to provide a comfortable ride. \rTire Construction and Production Sequence A tire is an assembly of many parts, whose manufacture is unexpectedly complex. A passenger car tire consists of about 50 individual pieces; a large earthmover tire may have as many as 175. To begin with, there are three basic tire constructions: (a) diagonal ply, (b) belted bias, and (c) radial ply, pictured in Figure 14.18.

A passenger car tire consists of about 50 individual pieces; a large earthmover tire may have as many as 175. To begin with, there are three basic tire constructions: (a) diagonal ply, (b) belted bias, and (c) radial ply, pictured in Figure 14.18. In all three cases, the internal structure of the tire, known as the carcass, consists of multiple layers of rubber-coated cords, called plies. The cords are strands of various materials such as nylon, polyester, \ufb01berglass, and steel, which provide inextensibility to reinforce the rubber in the carcass. The diagonal ply tire has the cords running diagonally, but in perpendicular directions in adjacent layers. A typical diagonal ply tire may have four plies. The belted bias tire is constructed of diagonal plies with opposite bias but adds several more layers around the outside periphery of the carcass. These belts increase the stiffness of the tire in the tread area and limit its diametric expansion during in\ufb02ation. The cords in the belt also run diagonally, as indicated in the sketch. \r\rA radial tire has plies running radially rather than diagonally; it also uses belts around the periphery for support.A steel-belted radial is a tire in which the circumferential belts have cords made of steel. The radial construction provides a more \ufb02exible sidewall which tends to reduce stress on the belts and treads as they continually deform on contact with the \ufb02at road surface during rotation. This effect is accompanied by greater tread life, improved cornering and driving stability, and a better ride at high speeds. \rIn each construction, the carcass is covered by solid rubber that reaches a maximum thickness in the tread area. The carcass is also lined on the inside with a rubber coating. For tires with inner tubes, the inner liner is a thin coating applied to the innermost ply during its fabrication. For tubeless tires, the inner liner must have low permeability because it holds the air pressure; it is generally a laminated rubber. \rTire production can be summarized in three steps: (1) preforming of components, \r(2) building the carcass and adding rubber strips to form the sidewalls and treads, and (3) molding and curing the components into one integral piece.The descriptions of these steps that follow are typical; there are variations in processing depending on construction, tire size, and type of vehicle on which the tire will be used. \rPreforming of Components As Figure 14.18 shows, the carcass consists of a number of separate components, most of which are rubber or reinforced rubber. These, as well as the sidewall and tread rubber, are produced by continuous processes and then pre-cut to size and shape for subsequent assembly. The components, labeled in Figure 14.18, and the preforming processes to fabricate them are: \r\u27a2 \rBead coil.

Pre-cut strips that form the carcass are built up around this arbor in a step-by-step procedure. The layered plies that form the cross section of the tire are anchored on opposite sides of the rim by two bead coils.The bead coils consist of multiple strands of high-strength steel wire. Their function is to provide a rigid support when the \ufb01nished tire is mounted on the wheel rim. Other components are combined with the plies and bead coils.These include various wrappings and \ufb01ller pieces to give the tire the proper strength, heat resistance, air retention, and \ufb01tting to the wheel rim. After these parts are placed around the arbor and the proper number of plies have been added, the belts are applied. This is followed by the outside rubber that will become \r\rFIGURE 14.20 Tire molding (tire is shownin cross-sectional view): (1) the uncuredtire is placed overexpandable diaphragm;\r(2) the mold is closed and the diaphragmis expanded to forceuncured rubber againstmold cavity,  impressingtread pattern intorubber; mold and diaphragm are heatedto cure rubber. \r\rthe sidewall and tread.1 At this point in the process, the treads are rubber strips of uniform cross section\u2014the tread design is added later in molding. The building drum is collapsible, so that the un\ufb01nished tire can be removed when \ufb01nished. The form of the tire at this stage is roughly tubular, as portrayed in Figure 14.19. \rMolding and Curing Tire molds are usually two-piece construction (split molds) and contain the tread pattern to be impressed on the tire. The mold is bolted into a press, one half attached to the upper platen (the lid) and the bottom half fastened to the lower platen (the base). The uncured tire is placed over an expandable diaphragm and inserted between the mold halves, as in Figure 14.20. The press is then closed and the diaphragm expanded, so that the soft rubber is pressed against the cavity of the mold. This causes the tread pattern to be imparted to the rubber. At the same time, the rubber is heated, both from the outside by the mold and from the inside by the diaphragm. Circulating hot water or steam under pressure are used to heat the diaphragm. The duration of this curing step depends on the thickness of the tire wall. A typical passenger tire can be cured in about 15 minutes. Bicycle tires cure in about 4 minutes, whereas tires for large earth moving equipment take several hours to cure.After curing is completed,the tire is cooled and removed from the press. \r\r1Technically, the tread and sidewall are not usually considered to be components of the carcass. \r\r14.6.2 OTHER RUBBER PRODUCTS \rMost other rubber products are made by less complex processes. Rubber belts are widely used in conveyors and mechanical power transmission systems. As with tires, rubber is an ideal material for these products, but the belt must have \ufb02exibility but little or no extensibility.Accordingly,it is reinforced with \ufb01bers,commonly polyester or nylon. Fabrics of these polymers are usually coated in calendering operations, assembled together to obtain the required number of plies and thickness, and subsequently vulcanized by continuous or batch heating processes. \rRubber hose can be either plain or reinforced.

In the case of traditional ceramics, the powders are produced by crushing and grinding common materials that are found in nature, such as silicate minerals (clay) and quartz. In the case of metals and the new ceramics, the powders are produced by a variety of industrial processes.The powder-making processes as well as the methods used to shape products out of powders are covered in two chapters: Chapter 15 on powder metallurgy and Chapter 16 on particulate processing of ceramics and cermets. \rPowder metallurgy (PM) is a metal processing technology in which parts are produced from metallic powders. In the usual PM production sequence, the powders are compressed into the desired shape and then heated to cause bonding of the particles into a hard, rigid mass. Compression, called pressing, is accomplished in a press-type machine using tools designed speci\ufb01 cally for the part to be manufactured. The tooling, which typically consists of a die and one or more punches, can be expensive, and PM is therefore most appropriate for medium and high production. The heating treatment, called sintering, is performed at a temperature below the melting point of the metal. Considerations that make powder metallurgy an important commercial technology include: \r\r\u27a2 \rPM parts can be mass produced to net shape or near net shape, eliminating or reducing the need for subsequent processing. \r\r\u27a2 \rThe PM process itself involves very little waste of material;about 97% of the starting powders are converted to product. This compares favorably with casting processes in which sprues, runners, and risers are wasted material in the production cycle. \r\r\u27a2 \rOwing to the nature of the starting material in PM, parts having a speci\ufb01ed level of porosity can be made. This feature lends itself to the production of porous metal parts, such as \ufb01lters, and oil-impregnated bearings and gears. \r\r\u27a2 \rCertain metals that are dif\ufb01cult to fabricate by other methods can be shaped by powder metallurgy.Tungsten is an example;tungsten \ufb01laments used in incandescent lamp bulbs are made using PM technology. \r\r\u27a2 \rCertain metal alloy combinations and cermets can be formed by PM that cannot be produced by other methods. \r\r\u27a2 \rPM compares favorably with most casting processes in terms of dimensional control of the product. Tolerances of 0.13 mm (0.005 in) are held routinely. \r\r\u27a2 \rPM production methods can be automated for economical production. \r\r\rThere are limitations and disadvantages associated with PM processing. These include the following: (1) tooling and equipment costs are high, (2) metallic powders are expensive, and (3) there are dif\ufb01culties with storing and handling metal powders (such as degradation of the metal over time, and \ufb01re hazards with particular metals). Also, (4) there are limitations on part geometry because metal powders do not readily \ufb02ow laterally in the die during pressing, and allowances must be provided for ejection of the part from the die after pressing. In addition, (5) variations in material density throughout the part may be a problem in PM, especially for complex part geometries.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4016, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c20e6a5-f5a7-4c62-b146-0830b5c4b78b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c20e6a5-f5a7-4c62-b146-0830b5c4b78b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec15.txt", "file_name": "sec15.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49032, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7a2aec33-7c72-4df3-ae50-847ab494f85d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec15.txt", "file_name": "sec15.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49032, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "365f21a9a8bf9c4a2c7fdb12586f40425b99c159f7604d81c80e4fcdf5b8cc1c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "529e91b6-ba75-47d8-b847-afc0396d0f42", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec15.txt", "file_name": "sec15.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49032, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "673125c0275a79f92efa41a3f53452f742752a47c2df4c571e87bf0474eab85e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7a2df0a-e6f9-48a5-95a3-af5b811ec094", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ff0b7d51df0f792107e825c52feafe792b36c8ff75a72dd12d24924096fe48e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Tolerances of 0.13 mm (0.005 in) are held routinely. \r\r\u27a2 \rPM production methods can be automated for economical production. \r\r\rThere are limitations and disadvantages associated with PM processing.

A collection of typical PM parts is shown in Figure 15.1. \r\rThe largest tonnage of metals for PM are alloys of iron, steel, and aluminum. Other PM metals include copper, nickel, and refractory metals such as molybdenum and tungsten. Metallic carbides such as tungsten carbide are often included within the scope of powder metallurgy; however, because these materials are ceramics, their consideration is deferred until the next chapter. \rThe development of the modern \ufb01eld of powder metallurgy dates back to the 1800s (Historical Note 15.1). The scope of the modern technology includes not only parts production but also preparation of the starting powders. Success in powder metallurgy depends to a large degree on the characteristics of the starting powders; this topic is discussed in Section 15.1. Later sections describe powder production, pressing, and sintering. There is a close correlation between PM technology and aspects of ceramics processing. In ceramics (except glass), the starting material is also powder, so the methods for characterizing the powders are closely related to those in PM. Several of the shape-forming methods are similar, also. \r\r\r\rHistorical Note 15.1 Powder metallurgy \rPowders of metals such as gold and copper, as well as some of the metallic oxides, have been used for decorative purposes since ancient times. The uses included decorations on pottery, bases for paints, and in cosmetics. It is believed that the Egyptians used PM to make tools as far back as 3000 B.C. \rThe modern \ufb01eld of powder metallurgy dates to the early nineteenth century, when there was a strong interest in the metal platinum. Around 1815, Englishman William Wollaston developed a technique for preparing platinum powders, compacting them under high pressure, and baking (sintering) them at red heat. The Wollaston process marks the beginning of powder metallurgy as it is practiced today. \rU.S. patents were issued in 1870 to S. Gwynn that relate to PM self-lubricating bearings. He used a mixture of 99% powdered tin and 1% petroleum, mixing, heating, and \ufb01nally subjecting the mixture to extreme pressures to form it into the desired shape inside a mold cavity. \rBy the early 1900s, the incandescent lamp had become an important commercial product. A variety of \ufb01lament materials had been tried, including carbon, zirconium, vanadium, and osmium; but it was concluded that tungsten was the best \ufb01 lament material. The problem was that tungsten was dif\ufb01cult to process because of its high melting point and unique properties. In 1908, William Coolidge developed a procedure that made production of tungsten incandescent lamp \ufb01laments feasible. In his process, \ufb01ne powders of tungsten oxide (WO3) were reduced to metallic powders, pressed into compacts, presintered, hot-forged into rounds, sintered, and \ufb01nally drawn into \ufb01lament wire. The Coolidge process is still used today to make \ufb01laments for incandescent light bulbs. \rIn the 1920s, cemented carbide tools (WC\u2013Co) were being fabricated by PM techniques (Historical Note 7.2).

However, most of the discussion applies to ceramic powders as well. \r\r15.1.1 GEOMETRIC FEATURES \rThe geometry of the individual powders can be de\ufb01ned by the following attributes: \r(1) \rparticle size and distribution, (2) particle shape and internal structure, and \r\r(3)\r surface area. \r\r\rParticle Size and Distribution Particle size refers to the dimensions of the individual powders. If the particle shape is spherical, a single dimension is adequate. For other shapes, two or more dimensions are needed. There are various methods available to obtain particle size data. The most common method uses screens of different mesh sizes. The term mesh count is used to refer to the number of openings per linear inch of screen. Higher mesh count indicates smaller particle size. A mesh count of 200 means there are 200 openings per linear inch. Because the mesh is square, the count is the same in both directions, and the total number of openings per square inch is 2002  40,000. \rParticles are sorted by passing them through a series of screens of progressively smaller mesh size. The powders are placed on a screen of a certain mesh count and vibrated so that particles small enough to \ufb01t through the openings pass through to the next screen below. The second screen empties into a third, and so forth, so that the particles are sorted according to size. A certain powder size might be called size 230 through 200, indicating that the powders have passed through the 200 mesh, but not 230. The procedure of separating the powders by size is called classi\ufb01 cation. \rThe openings in the screen are less than the reciprocal of the mesh count because of the thickness of the wire in the screen,as illustrated in Figure 15.2.Assuming that the limiting dimension of the particle is equal to the screen opening, \rK\rPS # tw (15.1)\rMC \r\rwhere PS \" particle size, mm (in); MC \" mesh count, openings per linear inch; and tw \" wire thickness of screen mesh, mm (in); and K \" a constant whose value \" 25.4 when the size units are millimeters (and K \" 1.0 when the units are inches). The \ufb01gure shows how smaller particles would pass through the openings, whereas larger powders would not. Variations occur in the powder sizes sorted by screening owing to differences in particle shapes, the range of sizes between mesh count steps, and variations in screen openings within a given mesh count.Also,the screening method has a practical upper limit of MC \" 400 (approximately), because of the dif\ufb01culty in making such \ufb01ne screens and because of agglomerationof the small powders. Other methods to measure particle size include microscopy and X-ray techniques. \r\r\rTypical particle sizes used in conventional powder metallurgy (press and sinter) range between 25 and 300 mm (0.001 and 0.012 in).1 The low end of the range corresponds to a mesh count of about 500, which is too small to be measured by the mesh count method; and the high end of the range corresponds to a mesh count of around 50.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6554, "end_char_idx": 10573, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "913b6a5d-5d69-4bed-b7d2-f44398aaff72": {"__data__": {"id_": "913b6a5d-5d69-4bed-b7d2-f44398aaff72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec15.txt", "file_name": "sec15.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49032, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7a2aec33-7c72-4df3-ae50-847ab494f85d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec15.txt", "file_name": "sec15.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49032, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "365f21a9a8bf9c4a2c7fdb12586f40425b99c159f7604d81c80e4fcdf5b8cc1c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7a2df0a-e6f9-48a5-95a3-af5b811ec094", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec15.txt", "file_name": "sec15.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 49032, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "155443677e8196f6feda99e089e4cfcee5ce1cd791f96ee1474d4b1ff5e42b4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e6853e08-8e5e-4f33-a355-639b84f568b3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "038f2cfde2b38e5fccc824703b27e4cc6403d7c34cb8014da3976f46989a6d4a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Variations occur in the powder sizes sorted by screening owing to differences in particle shapes, the range of sizes between mesh count steps, and variations in screen openings within a given mesh count.Also,the screening method has a practical upper limit of MC \" 400 (approximately), because of the dif\ufb01culty in making such \ufb01ne screens and because of agglomerationof the small powders.

Microscopic techniques are required to determine shape characteristics. \rAny volume of loose powders will contain pores between the particles.These are called open pores because they are external to the individual particles. Open pores are spaces into which a \ufb02 uid such as water, oil, or a molten metal, can penetrate. In addition, there are closed pores\u2014internal voids in the structure of an individual particle. The existence of these internal pores is usually minimal, and their effect when they do exist is minor, but they can in\ufb02uence density measurements. \rSurface Area Assuming that the particle shape is a perfect sphere, its area A and volume V are given by \rA \" pD2 (15.2) \rV \" pD3 \r(15.3)\r6 \rwhere D \" diameter of the spherical particle, mm (in). The area-to-volume ratio A/V for a sphere is then given by \r__ A __6\r\" (15.4)\rVD \rIn general, the area-to-volume ratio can be expressed for any particle shape\u2014spherical or nonspherical\u2014as follows: \rKs AD\r__ A ___ ____ \r\" or Ks = (15.5)\rVD V \r1These values are provided by Prof. Wojciech Misiolek, the author\u2019s colleague in Lehigh\u2019s Department of Materials Science and Engineering. Powder metallurgy is one of his research areas. \r\rwhere Ks  shape factor; D in the general case \" the diameter of a sphere of equivalent volume as the nonspherical particle, mm (in). Thus, Ks \" 6.0 for a sphere. For particle shapes other than spherical, Ks > 6. \rThe following can be inferred from these equations. Smaller particle size and higher shape factor (Ks) mean higher surface area for the same total weight of metal powders. This means greater area for surface oxidation to occur. Small powder size also leads to more agglomeration of the particles, which is a problem in automatic feeding of the powders.The reason for using smaller particle sizes is that they provide more uniform shrinkage and better mechanical properties in the \ufb01nal PM product. \r\r15.1.2 OTHER FEATURES \rOther features of engineering powders include interparticle friction, \ufb02ow characteristics, packing, density, porosity, chemistry, and surface \ufb01lms. \rInterparticle Friction and Flow Characteristics Friction between particles affects the ability of a powder to \ufb02ow readily and pack tightly. A common measure of inter-particle friction is the angle of repose, which is the angle formed by a pile of powders as they are poured from a narrow funnel, as in Figure 15.4. Larger angles indicate greater friction between particles. Smaller particle sizes generally show greater friction and steeper angles.

A common measure of inter-particle friction is the angle of repose, which is the angle formed by a pile of powders as they are poured from a narrow funnel, as in Figure 15.4. Larger angles indicate greater friction between particles. Smaller particle sizes generally show greater friction and steeper angles. Spherical shapes result in the lowest interparticle friction; as shape deviates more from spherical, friction between particles tends to increase. \rFlow characteristics are important in die \ufb01lling and pressing. Automatic die \ufb01lling depends on easy and consistent \ufb02ow of the powders. In pressing, resistance to \ufb02ow increases density variations in the compacted part;these density gradients are generally undesirable. A common measure of \ufb02ow is the time required for a certain amount of powder (by weight) to \ufb02ow through a standard-sized funnel.Smaller \ufb02ow times indicate easier \ufb02ow and lower interparticle friction.To reduce interparticle friction and facilitate \ufb02 ow during pressing, lubricants are often added to the powders in small amounts. \rPacking, Density, and Porosity Packing characteristics depend on two density measures. First, true density is the density of the true volume of the material. This is the density when the powders are melted into a solid mass, values of which are given in Table 4.1. Second, bulk density is the density of the powders in the loose state after pouring, which includes the effect of pores between particles. Because of the pores, bulk density is less than true density. \r\rThe packing factor is the bulk density divided by the true density. Typical values for loose powders range between 0.5 and 0.7. The packing factor depends on particle shape and the distribution of particle sizes. If powders of various sizes are present, the smaller powders will \ufb01t into the interstices of the larger ones that would otherwise be taken up by air, thus resulting in a higher packing factor. Packing can also be increased by vibrating the powders, causing them to settle more tightly. Finally, the external pressure applied during compaction greatly increases packing of powders through rearrangement and deformation of the particles. \rPorosity represents an alternative way of considering the packing characteristics of a powder. Porosity is de\ufb01ned as the ratio of the volume of the pores (empty spaces) in the powder to the bulk volume. In principle, \rPorosity  Packing factor  1.0 (15.6) \rThe issue is complicated by the possible existence of closed pores in some of the particles. If these internal pore volumes are included in the above porosity, then the equation is exact. \rChemistry and Surface Films Characterization of the powder would not be complete without an identi\ufb01cation of its chemistry. Metallic powders are classi\ufb01ed as either elemental, consisting of a pure metal, or pre-alloyed, wherein each particle is an alloy. These classes and the metals commonly used in PM are discussed more thoroughly in Section 15.5. \rSurface \ufb01lms are a problem in powder metallurgy because of the large area per unit weight of metal when dealing with powders. The possible \ufb01lms include oxides, silica, adsorbed organic materials, and moisture [6]. Generally, these \ufb01lms must be removed before shape processing. \r\r\r\r\rProduction of Metallic Powders \rIn general, producers of metallic powders are not the same companies as those that make PM parts.The powder producers are the suppliers;the plants that manufacture components out of powder metals are the customers. It is therefore appropriate to separate the discussion of powder production (this section) from the processes used to make PM products (later sections). \rVirtually any metal can be made into powder form.

In addition, mechanical methods are occasionally used to reduce powder sizes; however, these methods are much more commonly associated with ceramic powder production and are covered in the next chapter. \r\r15.2.1 ATOMIZATION \rThis method involves the conversion of molten metal into a spray of droplets that solidify into powders. It is the most versatile and popular method for producing metal powders today, applicable to almost all metals, alloys as well as pure metals. There are multiple ways of creating the molten metal spray, several of which are illustrated in Figure 15.5. Two of the methods shown are based on gas atomization, in which a high velocity gas stream (air or inert gas) is utilized to atomize the liquid metal. In Figure 15.5(a), the gas \ufb02ows through an expansion nozzle, siphoning molten metal from the melt below and spraying it into a container. The droplets solidify into powder form. In a closely related method shown in Figure 15.5(b), molten metal \ufb02ows by gravity through a nozzle and is immediately atomized by air jets. The resulting metal powders, which tend to be spherical, are collected in a chamber below. \r\rThe approach shown in Figure 15.5(c) is similar to (b), except that a high-velocity water stream is used instead of air. This is known as water atomization and is the most common of the atomization methods, particularly suited to metals that melt below 1600\u00b0C (2900\u00b0F). Cooling is more rapid, and the resulting powder shape is irregular rather than spherical. The disadvantage of using water is oxidation on the particle surface. A recent innovation involves the use of synthetic oil rather than water to reduce oxidation. In both air and water atomization processes, particle size is controlled largely by the velocity of the \ufb02uid stream; particle size is inversely related to velocity. \rSeveral methods are based on centrifugal atomization. In one approach, the rotating disk method shown in Figure 15.5(d), the liquid metal stream pours onto a rapidly rotating disk that sprays the metal in all directions to produce powders. \r\r(c) water atomization; and (d) centrifugal atomization by the rotating disk method. \r\rFIGURE 15.6 \r\rIron powders produced bywater atomization; particlesizes vary.

Murphy and Hoeganaes Corporation.) \r\r15.2.2 OTHER PRODUCTION METHODS \r\rOther metal powder production methods include various chemical reduction processes, precipitation methods, and electrolysis. \rChemical reduction includes a variety of chemical reactions by which metallic compounds are reduced to elemental metal powders. A common process involves liberation of metals from their oxides by use of reducing agents such as hydrogen or carbon monoxide.The reducing agent is made to combine with the oxygen in the compound to free the metallic element.This approach is used to produce powders of iron,tungsten, and copper. Another chemical process for iron powders involves the decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(Co)5) to produce spherical particles of high purity. Powders produced by this method are illustrated in the photomicrograph of Figure 15.6. Other chemical processes include precipitation of metallic elements from salts dissolved in water. Powders of copper, nickel, and cobalt can be produced by this approach. \rIn electrolysis, an electrolytic cell is set up in which the source of the desired metal is the anode. The anode is slowly dissolved under an applied voltage, transported through the electrolyte,and deposited on the cathode.The deposit is removed, washed, and dried to yield a metallic powder of very high purity.

The technique is used for producing powders of beryllium, copper, iron, silver, tantalum, and titanium. \r\r\r\rConventional Pressing and Sintering \rAfter the metallic powders have been produced, the conventional PM sequence consists of three steps: (1) blending and mixing of the powders; (2) compaction, in which the powders are pressed into the desired part shape; and (3) sintering, which involves heating to a temperature below the melting point to cause solid-state \r\r\r(2)\r compacting, and\r\r(3)\r sintering; (a) showsthe condition of the particles while (b)shows the operationand/or work part duringthe sequence. \r\r\rbonding of the particles and strengthening of the part. The three steps, sometimes referred to as primary operations in PM, are portrayed in Figure 15.7. In addition, secondary operations are sometimes performed to improve dimensional accuracy, increase density, and for other reasons. \r15.3.1 BLENDING AND MIXING OF THE POWDERS \rTo achieve successful results in compaction and sintering, the metallic powders must be thoroughly homogenized beforehand. The terms blending and mixing are both used in this context. Blending refers to when powders of the same chemical composition but possibly different particle sizes are intermingled. Different particle sizes are often blended to reduce porosity. Mixing refers to powders of different chemistries being combined. An advantage of PM technology is the opportunity to mix various metals into alloys that would be dif\ufb01 cult or impossible to produce by other means. The distinction between blending and mixing is not always precise in industrial practice. \rBlending and mixing are accomplished by mechanical means. Four alternatives are illustrated in Figure 15.8: (a) rotation in a drum; (b) rotation in a double-cone container; (c) agitation in a screw mixer; and (d) stirring in a blade mixer. There is more science to these devices than one would suspect. Best results seem to occur when the container is between 20% and 40% full. The containers are usually designed with internal baf\ufb02es or other ways of preventing free-fall during blending of powders of different sizes, because variations in settling rates between sizes result in segregation\u2014just the opposite of what is wanted in blending. Vibration of the powder is undesirable, because it also causes segregation. \rOther ingredients are usually added to the metallic powders during the blending and/or mixing step.These additives include (1) lubricants,such as stearates of zinc and aluminum, in small amounts to reduce friction between particles and at the die wall \r\r(d) blade mixer. \rduring compaction; (2) binders, which are required in some cases to achieve adequate strength in the pressed but unsintered part; and (3) de\ufb02 occulants, which inhibit agglomeration of powders for better \ufb02ow characteristics during subsequent processing. \r\r\r15.3.2 COMPACTION \rIn compaction, high pressure is applied to the powders to form them into the required shape. The conventional compaction method is pressing, in which opposing punches squeeze the powders contained in a die. The steps in the pressing cycle are shown in Figure 15.9.

The sequence here corresponds to steps 1, 2, and 3 in Figure 15.9. \r\r15.3.3 SINTERING \r\rThe green strength of the part when pressed is adequate for handling but far less than that achieved after sintering. \rThe applied pressure in compaction results initially in repacking of the powders into a more ef\ufb01cient arrangement, eliminating \u201cbridges\u201d formed during \ufb01 lling, reducing pore space,and increasing the number of contacting points between particles.As pressure increases, the particles are plastically deformed, causing interparticle contact area to increase and additional particles to make contact. This is accompanied by a further reduction in pore volume. The progression is illustrated in three views in Figure 15.10 for starting particles of spherical shape. Also shown is the associated density represented by the three views as a function of applied pressure. \rPresses used in conventional PM compaction are mechanical, hydraulic, or a combination of the two. A 450 kN (50 ton) hydraulic unit is shown in Figure 15.11. Because of differences in part complexity and associated pressing requirements, presses can be distinguished as (1) pressing from one direction, referred to as single-action presses; or (2) pressing from two directions, any of several types including opposed ram, double-action, and multiple action. Current available press technology can provide up to 10 separate action controls to produce parts of signi\ufb01 cant geometric complexity. Part complexity and other design issues are examined in Section 15.6. \rThe capacity of a press for PM production is generally given in tons or kN or MN. The required force for pressing depends on the projected area of the PM part (area in the horizontal plane for a vertical press) multiplied by the pressure needed to compact the given metal powders. Reducing this to equation form,\r F \" Appc (15.7) \r\rwhere F  required force, N (lb); Ap  projected area of the part, mm2 (in2); and pc  compaction pressure required for the given powder material, MPa (lb/in2). Compaction pressures typically range from 70 MPa (10,000 lb/in2) for aluminum powders to 700 MPa (100,000 lb/in2) for iron and steel powders. \rAfter pressing, the green compact lacks strength and hardness; it is easily crumbled under low stresses.

The terms solid-state sintering or solid-phase sintering are sometimes used for this conventional sintering because the metal remains unmelted at these treatment temperatures. \rIt is generally agreed among researchers that the primary driving force for sintering is reduction of surface energy [6], [16]. The green compact consists of many distinct particles, each with its own individual surface, and so the total surface area contained in the compact is very high. Under the in\ufb02uence of heat, the surface area is reduced through the formation and growth of bonds between the particles, with associated reduction in surface energy. The \ufb01ner the initial powder size, the higher the total surface area, and the greater the driving force behind the process. \rThe series of sketches in Figure 15.12 shows on a microscopic scale the changes that occur during sintering of metallic powders. Sintering involves mass transport to create the necks and transform them into grain boundaries. The principal mechanism by which this occurs is diffusion; other possible mechanisms include plastic \ufb02 ow. Shrinkage occurs during sintering as a result of pore size reduction. This depends to a large extent on the density of the green compact, which depends on the pressure during compaction. Shrinkage is generally predictable when processing conditions are closely controlled. \rBecause PM applications usually involve medium-to-high production, most sintering furnaces are designed with mechanized \ufb02ow-through capability for the work parts. The heat treatment consists of three steps, accomplished in three chambers in these continuous furnaces: (1) preheat, in which lubricants and \r\rFIGURE 15.12 \rSintering on a microscopic scale: \r(1) \rparticle bonding is initiated at contact points; (2) contact points grow into \u201cnecks\u201d; (3) the pores between particles are reduced in size; and \r\r(4) \rgrain boundaries develop between particles in place of the necked regions. \r\r\r\rbinders are burned off; (2) sinter; and (3) cool down. The treatment is illustrated in Figure 15.13. Typical sintering temperatures and times are given for selected metals in Table 15.1. \rIn modern sintering practice, the atmosphere in the furnace is controlled. The purposes of a controlled atmosphere include (1) protection from oxidation, (2) providing a reducing atmosphere to remove existing oxides, (3) providing a carburizing atmosphere, and (4) assisting in removing lubricants and binders used in pressing. Common sintering furnace atmospheres are inert gas, nitrogen-based, dissociated ammonia, hydrogen, and natural gas [6].

Machining is rarely done to size the part, but rather to create geometric features that cannot be achieved by pressing, such as internal and external threads, side holes, and other details. \rImpregnation and In\ufb01ltration Porosity is a unique and inherent characteristic of powder metallurgy technology. It can be exploited to create special products by \ufb01lling the available pore space with oils, polymers, or metals that have lower melting temperatures than the base powder metal. \rImpregnation is the term used when oil or other \ufb02uid is permeated into the pores of a sintered PM part. The most common products of this process are oil-impregnated bearings, gears, and similar machinery components. Self-lubricating bearings, usually made of bronze or iron with 10% to 30% oil by volume, are widely used in the automotive industry. The treatment is accomplished by immersing the sintered parts in a bath of hot oil. \rAn alternative application of impregnation involves PM parts that must be made pressure tight or impervious to \ufb02uids. In this case, the parts are impregnated with various types of polymer resins that seep into the pore spaces in liquid form and then solidify. In some cases, resin impregnation is used to facilitate subsequent processing, for example, to permit the use of processing solutions (such as plating chemicals) that would otherwise soak into the pores and degrade the product, or to improve machinability of the PM work part. \rIn\ufb01 ltration is an operation in which the pores of the PM part are \ufb01lled with a molten metal.The melting point of the \ufb01 ller metal must be below that of the PM part.The process involves heating the \ufb01 ller metal in contact with the sintered component so that capillary action draws the \ufb01 ller into the pores.The resulting structure is relatively nonporous, and the in\ufb01 ltrated part has a more uniform density, as well as improved toughness and strength. An application of the process is copper in\ufb01 ltration of iron PM parts. \r\rHeat Treatment and Finishing Powder metal components can be heat treated (Chapter 26) and finished (electroplated or painted, Chapter 27) by most of the same processes used on parts produced by casting and other metalworking processes. Special care must be exercised in heat treatment because of porosity; for example, salt baths are not used for heating PM parts. Plating and coating operations are applied to sintered parts for appearance purposes and corrosion resistance. Again, precautions must be taken to avoid entrapment of chemical solutions in the pores; impregnation and infiltration are frequently used for this purpose. Common platings for PM parts include copper, nickel, chromium, zinc, and cadmium. \r\r\r\rAlternative Pressing and Sintering Techniques \rThe conventional press and sinter sequence is the most widely used shaping technology in powder metallurgy. Additional methods for processing PM parts are discussed in this section. \r15.4.1 ISOSTATIC PRESSING \rA feature of conventional pressing is that pressure is applied uniaxially.This imposes limitations on part geometry, because metallic powders do not readily \ufb02ow in directions perpendicular to the applied pressure. Uniaxial pressing also leads to density variations in the compact after pressing. In isostatic pressing, pressure is applied from all directions against the powders that are contained in a \ufb02exible mold; hydraulic pressure is used to achieve compaction.

Isostatic pressing takes two alternative forms: (1) cold isostatic pressing and (2) hot isostatic pressing. \rCold isostatic pressing (CIP) involves compaction performed at room tempera-ture.The mold,made of rubber or other elastomer material,is oversized to compensate for shrinkage. Water or oil is used to provide the hydrostatic pressure against the mold inside the chamber. Figure 15.14 illustrates the processing sequence in cold isostatic pressing.Advantages of CIP include more uniform density,less expensive tooling, and greater applicability to shorter production runs. Good dimensional accuracy is dif\ufb01cult to achieve in isostatic pressing, because of the \ufb02 exible mold. Consequently, subsequent \ufb01nish shaping operations are often required to obtain the required dimensions, either before or after sintering. \rHot isostatic pressing (HIP) is carried out at high temperatures and pressures, using a gas such as argon or helium as the compression medium. The mold in which the powders are contained is made of sheetmetal to withstand the high temperatures. HIP accomplishes pressing and sintering in one step. Despite this apparent advantage, it is a relatively expensive process and its applications seem to be concentrated in the aerospace industry. PM parts made by HIP are characterized by high density (porosity near zero), thorough interparticle bonding, and good mechanical strength. \r\r\r15.4.2 POWDER INJECTION MOLDING \rInjection molding is closely associated with the plastics industry (Section 13.6). The same basic process can be applied to form parts of metal or ceramic powders, the difference being that the starting polymer contains a high content of particulate matter, typically from 50% to 85% by volume. When used in powder metallurgy, the term metal injection molding (MIM) is used.The more general process is powder injection molding (PIM), which includes both metal and ceramic powders. The steps in MIM proceed as follows [7]: (1) Metallic powders are mixed with an appropriate binder. (2) Granular pellets are formed from the mixture. (3) The pellets are heated to molding temperature, injected into a mold cavity, and the part is cooled and removed from the mold. (4) The part is processed to remove the binder using any of several thermal or solvent techniques. (5) The part is sintered. (6) Secondary operations are performed as appropriate. \rThe binder in powder injection molding acts as a carrier for the particles. Its func\rtions are to provide proper \ufb02ow characteristics during molding and hold the pow\rders in the molded shape until sintering. The \ufb01ve basic types of binders in PIM are \r(1) thermosetting polymers, such as phenolics; (2) thermoplastic polymers, such as polyethylene; (3) water; (4) gels; and (5) inorganic materials [7]. Polymers are the most frequently used. \rPowder injection molding is suited to part geometries similar to those in plastic injection molding. It is not cost competitive for simple axisymmetric parts, because the conventional press-and-sinter process is quite adequate for these cases. PIM seems most economical for small, complex parts of high value. Dimensional accuracy is limited by the shrinkage that accompanies densi\ufb01cation during sintering. \r\r\r15.4.3 POWDER ROLLING, EXTRUSION, AND FORGING \rRolling, extrusion, and forging are familiar bulk deformation processes (Chapter 18).

Their applications are described here in the context of powder metallurgy. \r\r\rFIGURE 15.15 Powder rolling: (1) powders arefed through compactionrolls to form a greenstrip; (2) sintering; (3)cold rolling; and (4)resintering. \rPowder Rolling Powders can be compressed in a rolling mill operation to form metal strip stock. The process is usually set up to run continuously or semicontinuously, as shown in Figure 15.15. The metallic powders are compacted between rolls into a green strip that is fed directly into a sintering furnace. It is then cold rolled and resintered. \rPowder Extrusion In the most popular PM extrusion method, powders are placed in a vacuum-tight sheet metal can, heated, and extruded with the container. In another variation, billets are preformed by a conventional press and sinter process, and then the billet is hot extruded. These methods achieve a high degree of densi\ufb01 cation in the PM product. \rPowder Forging In powder forging, the starting work part is a powder metallurgy part preformed to proper size by pressing and sintering. Advantages of this approach are: (1) densi\ufb01cation of the PM part, (2) lower tooling costs and fewer forging \u201chits\u201d (and therefore higher production rate) because the starting work part is preformed, and (3) reduced material waste. \r\r15.4.4 COMBINED PRESSING AND SINTERING \rHot isostatic pressing (Section 15.4.1) accomplishes compaction and sintering in one step. Other techniques that combine the two steps are hot pressing and spark sintering. \rHot Pressing The setup in uniaxial hot pressing is very similar to conventional PM pressing,except that heat is applied during compaction.The resulting product is generally dense, strong, hard, and dimensionally accurate. Despite these advantages, the process presents certain technical problems that limit its adoption. Principal among these are (1) selecting a suitable mold material that can withstand the high sintering temperatures; (2) longer production cycle required to accomplish sintering; and \r(3) heating and maintaining atmospheric control in the process [2]. Hot pressing has found some application in the production of sintered carbide products using graphite molds. \rSpark Sintering An alternative approach that combines pressing and sintering but overcomes some of the problems in hot pressing is spark sintering. The process consists of two basic steps [2], [17]: (1) powder or a green compacted preform is placed in a die; and (2) upper and lower punches, which also serve as electrodes, compress the part and simultaneously apply a high-energy electrical current that burns off surface contaminants and sinters the powders, forming a dense, solid part in about 15 seconds. The process has been applied to a variety of metals. \r\r\r15.4.5 LIQUID PHASE SINTERING \r\rConventional sintering (Section 15.3.3) is solid-state sintering; the metal is sintered at a temperature below its melting point. In systems involving a mixture of two powder metals, in which there is a difference in melting temperature between the metals, an alternative type of sintering is used, called liquid phase sintering. In this process, the two powders are initially mixed, and then heated to a temperature that is high enough to melt the lower-melting-point metal but not the other.

Accordingly, PM is competitive only in a certain range of applications. This section identi\ufb01es the materials and products that seem most suited to powder metallurgy. \rPowder Metallurgy Materials From a chemistry standpoint, metal powders can be classi\ufb01ed as either elemental or pre-alloyed. Elemental powders consist of a pure metal and are used in applications in which high purity is important. For example, pure iron might be used where its magnetic properties are important. The most common elemental powders are those of iron, aluminum, and copper. \rElemental powders are also mixed with other metal powders to produce special alloys that are dif\ufb01cult to formulate using conventional processing methods. Tool steels are an example; PM permits blending of ingredients that is dif\ufb01cult or impossible by traditional alloying techniques. Using mixtures of elemental powders to form an alloy provides a processing bene\ufb01t, even where special alloys are not involved. Because the powders are pure metals, they are not as strong as pre-alloyed metals. Therefore, they deform more readily during pressing, so that density and green strength are higher than with pre-alloyed compacts. \rIn pre-alloyed powders, each particle is an alloy composed of the desired chemical composition. Pre-alloyed powders are used for alloys that cannot be formulated by mixing elemental powders;stainless steel is an important example.The most common pre-alloyed powders are certain copper alloys, stainless steel, and high-speed steel. \r\rThe commonly used elemental and pre-alloyed powdered metals, in approximate order of tonnage usage, are: (1) iron, by far the most widely used PM metal, frequently mixed with graphite to make steel parts, (2) aluminum, (3) copper and its alloys, (4) nickel, (5) stainless steel, (6) high-speed steel, and (7) other PM materials such as tungsten, molybdenum, titanium, tin, and precious metals. \rPowder Metallurgy Products A substantial advantage offered by PM technology is that parts can be made to near net shape or net shape; they require little or no additional shaping after PM processing. Some of the components commonly manufactured by powder metallurgy are gears, bearings, sprockets, fasteners, electrical contacts, cutting tools, and various machinery parts. When produced in large quantities, metal gears and bearings are particularly well suited to PM for two reasons: (1) the geometry is de\ufb01ned principally in two dimensions, so the part has a top surface of a certain shape, but there are no features along the sides; and (2) there is a need for porosity in the material to serve as a reservoir for lubricant. More complex parts with true three-dimensional geometries are also feasible in powder metallurgy, by adding secondary operations such as machining to complete the shape of the pressed and sintered part, and by observing certain design guidelines such as those outlined in the following section. \r\r\rDesign Considerations in Powder Metallurgy \rUse of PM techniques is generally suited to a certain class of production situations and part designs. This section de\ufb01nes the characteristics of this class of applications for which powder metallurgy is most appropriate. \rThe Metal Powder Industries Federation (MPIF) de\ufb01nes four classes of powder metallurgy part designs, by level of dif\ufb01culty in conventional pressing.

This section de\ufb01nes the characteristics of this class of applications for which powder metallurgy is most appropriate. \rThe Metal Powder Industries Federation (MPIF) de\ufb01nes four classes of powder metallurgy part designs, by level of dif\ufb01culty in conventional pressing. The system is useful because it indicates some of the limitations on shape that can be achieved with conventional PM processing. The four part classes are illustrated in Figure 15.16. \rThe MPIF classi\ufb01cation system provides some guidance concerning part geometries suited to conventional PM pressing techniques. Additional advice is offered in the following design guidelines, compiled from [3], [13], and [17]. \r\r(a) Class I\u2014simple thin shapes that can be pressed from one direction; (b) Class II\u2014simplebut thicker shapes that require pressing from two directions; (c) Class III\u2014two levels ofthickness, pressed from two directions; and (d) Class IV\u2014multiple levels of thickness,pressed from two directions, with separate controls for each level to achieve properdensi\ufb01cation throughout the compact. \r(b) side undercuts. Part ejection is impossible. \r\r\u27a2 \rEconomics of PM processing usually require large part quantities to justify the cost of equipment and special tooling required. Minimum quantities of 10,000 units are suggested [17], although exceptions exist. \r\r\u27a2 \rPowder metallurgy is unique in its capability to fabricate parts with a controlled level of porosity. Porosities up to 50% are possible. \r\r\u27a2 \rPM can be used to make parts out of unusual metals and alloys\u2014materials that would be dif\ufb01cult if not impossible to fabricate by other means. \r\r\u27a2 \rThe geometry of the part must permit ejection from the die after pressing; this generally means that the part must have vertical or near-vertical sides, although steps in the part are permissible as suggested by the MPIF classi\ufb01cation system (Figure 15.16). Design features such as undercuts and holes on the part sides, as shown in Figure 15.17, must be avoided. Vertical under cuts and holes, as in Figure 15.18, are permissible because they do not inter fere with ejection. Vertical holes can be of cross-sectional shapes other than round (e.g., squares, key-ways) without signi\ufb01cant increases in tooling or processing dif\ufb01culty. \r\r\u27a2 \rScrew threads cannot be fabricated by PM pressing; if required, they must be machined into the PM component after sintering. \r\r\u27a2 \rChamfers and corner radii are possible by PM pressing, as shown in Figure 15.19. Problems are encountered in punch rigidity when angles are too acute. \r\r\u27a2 \rWall thickness should be a minimum of 1.5 mm (0.060 in) between holes or a hole and the outside part wall, as indicated in Figure 15.20. Minimum recommended hole diameter is 1.5 mm (0.060 in). \r\r\rFIGURE 15.18 \r\rPermissible partfeatures in PM: (a)vertical hole, blind and through, (b) verticalstepped hole, and (c)undercut in vertical direction.

The processing of glass involves solidi\ufb01cation primarily and is covered in Chapter 12. The present chapter considers the particulate processing methods used for traditional and new ceramics. Also included is the processing of metal matrix composites and ceramic matrix composites. \rTraditional ceramics are made from minerals occurring in nature. They include pottery, porcelain, bricks, and cement. New ceramics are made from synthetically produced raw materials and cover a wide spectrum of products such as cutting tools, arti\ufb01 cial bones, nuclear fuels, and substrates for electronic circuits. The starting material for all of these items is powder. In the case of the traditional ceramics, the powders are usually mixed with water to temporarily bind the particles together and achieve the proper consistency for shaping. For new ceramics, other substances are used as binders during shaping. After shaping, the green parts are sintered. This is often called \ufb01 ring in ceramics, but the function is the same as in powder metallurgy: to effect a solid-state reaction that bonds the material into a hard solid mass. \rThe processing methods discussed in this chapter are commercially and technologically important because virtually all ceramic products are formed by these methods (except, of course, glass products). The manufacturing sequence is similar for traditional and new ceramics because the form of the starting material is the same: powder. However, the processing methods for the two categories are suf\ufb01ciently different that they are discussed separately. \r\r\r Processing of Traditional Ceramics  \rThis section describes the production technology used to make traditional ceramic products such as pottery, stoneware and other dinnerware, bricks, tile, and ceramic refractories. Bonded grinding wheels are also produced by the same basic methods. What these products have in common is that their raw materials consist primarily of silicate ceramics\u2014clays.The processing sequence for most of the traditional ceramics consists of the steps depicted in Figure 16.1.  \r16.1.1  PREPARATION OF THE RAW MATERIAL  \r\r\rThe shaping processes for traditional ceramics require that the starting material be in the form of a plastic paste. This paste is made of \ufb01ne ceramic powders mixed with water, and its consistency determines the ease of forming the material and the quality of the \ufb01nal product. The raw ceramic material usually occurs in nature as rocky lumps, and reduction to powder is the purpose of the preparation step in ceramics processing. \rTechniques for reducing particle size in ceramics processing involve mechanical energy in various forms, such as impact, compression, and attrition. The term comminution is used for these techniques, which are most effective on brittle materials, including cement, metallic ores, and brittle metals. Two general categories of comminution operations are distinguished: crushing and grinding. \rCrushing refers to the reduction of large lumps from the mine to smaller sizes for subsequent further reduction. Several stages may be required (e.g., primary crushing, secondary crushing), the reduction ratio in each stage being in the range 3 to 6. Crushing of minerals is accomplished by compression against rigid surfaces or by impact against surfaces in a rigid constrained motion [1]. Figure 16.2 shows several types of equipment used to perform crushing: (a) jaw crushers, in which a large jaw toggles back and forth to crush lumps against a hard, rigid surface; (b) gyratory crushers, which useagyratingconeto compresslumps against a rigidsurface;(c) roll crushers,in which the ceramic lumps are squeezed between rotating rolls; and (d) hammer mills, which use rotating hammers impacting the material to break up the lumps.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4368, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "821fbc96-2f09-48d6-9337-fa8b2b81da76": {"__data__": {"id_": "821fbc96-2f09-48d6-9337-fa8b2b81da76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec16.txt", "file_name": "sec16.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 37913, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "514503d3-28b3-463b-b24d-7e9df6b278ce", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec16.txt", "file_name": "sec16.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 37913, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "b23c216a9ca4236d57d91149a05b7bc7e199fa27ab98d6a570361ea15d0deea7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bbe61457-2ccf-41a9-a8c1-78346936fa7b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec16.txt", "file_name": "sec16.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 37913, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "3e82e0659123b6b394dc6e9a700ce01801e9482931b7083a3944102d65d4d890", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5834f590-e683-4fd6-bfa4-a3d6ede04179", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "944423125e890d0decbd03f67ee3d63dfa5ae3f0eebe50b00feec37a95fd0e6a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Crushing refers to the reduction of large lumps from the mine to smaller sizes for subsequent further reduction.

Figure 16.2 shows several types of equipment used to perform crushing: (a) jaw crushers, in which a large jaw toggles back and forth to crush lumps against a hard, rigid surface; (b) gyratory crushers, which useagyratingconeto compresslumps against a rigidsurface;(c) roll crushers,in which the ceramic lumps are squeezed between rotating rolls; and (d) hammer mills, which use rotating hammers impacting the material to break up the lumps. \r\r\r\rGrinding, in the context here, refers to the operation of reducing the small pieces produced by crushing into a \ufb01ne powder. Grinding is accomplished by mechanisms such as abrasion, compaction, and impact of the crushed mineral by hard bodies such as balls, rollers, or surfaces. Examples of grinding include (a) ball mill, (b) roller mill, and (c) impact grinding, illustrated in Figure 16.3. \rIn a ball mill, hard spheres mixed with the stock to be comminuted are tumbled inside a rotating cylindrical container. The rotation causes the balls and stock to be carried up the container wall, and then pulled back down by gravity to accomplish a grinding action by a combination of impact and attrition. These operations are often carried out with water added to the mixture, so that the ceramic is in the form of a slurry. In a roller mill, stock is compressed against a \ufb02at horizontal grinding table by rollers riding over the table surface. Although not clearly shown in the sketch, the pressure of the grinding rollers against the table is regulated by mechanical springs or hydraulic-pneumatic means. In impact grinding, which seems to be less frequently used, particles of stock are thrown against a hard \ufb02at surface, either in a high velocity air stream or a high-speed slurry.The impact fractures the pieces into smaller particles. \r\rThe plastic paste required for shaping consists of ceramic powders and water. Clay is usually the main ingredient in the paste because it has ideal forming characteristics. The more water there is in the mixture, the more plastic and easily formed is the clay paste. However, when the formed part is later dried and \ufb01red, shrinkage occurs that can lead to cracking in the product.To address this problem,other ceramic raw materials that do not shrink on drying and \ufb01ring are usually added to the paste, often in signi\ufb01 cant amounts. Also, other components can be included to serve special functions. Thus, the ingredients of the ceramic paste can be divided into the following three categories [3]: (1) clay, which provides the consistency and plasticity required for shaping; \r(2) nonplastic raw materials, such as alumina and silica, which do not shrink in drying and \ufb01ring but unfortunately reduce plasticity in the mixture during forming; and (3) other ingredients, such as \ufb02uxes that melt (vitrify) during \ufb01ring and promote sintering of the ceramic material, and wetting agents that improve mixing of ingredients. \rThese ingredients must be thoroughly mixed,either wet or dry.The ball mill often serves this purpose in addition to its grinding function. Also, the proper amounts of powder and water in the paste must be attained, so water must be added or removed, depending on the prior condition of the paste and its desired \ufb01nal consistency. \r\r\r16.1.2 SHAPING PROCESSES \rThe optimum proportions of powder and water depend on the shaping process used. Some shaping processes require high \ufb02uidity; others act on a composition that contains very low water content. At about 50% water by volume, the mixture is a slurry that \ufb02ows like a liquid. As the water content is reduced, increased pressure is required on the paste to produce a similar \ufb02ow.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3537, "end_char_idx": 7564, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5834f590-e683-4fd6-bfa4-a3d6ede04179": {"__data__": {"id_": "5834f590-e683-4fd6-bfa4-a3d6ede04179", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec16.txt", "file_name": "sec16.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 37913, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "514503d3-28b3-463b-b24d-7e9df6b278ce", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec16.txt", "file_name": "sec16.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 37913, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "b23c216a9ca4236d57d91149a05b7bc7e199fa27ab98d6a570361ea15d0deea7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "821fbc96-2f09-48d6-9337-fa8b2b81da76", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec16.txt", "file_name": "sec16.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 37913, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "797f4d5a7499786fa0148e1c4987202a30bcac7790437b290488caf6293e499e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "add57420-9cbb-4427-90b7-7423d0d6b4c1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c2fd81225453a53bb4382adbbd5d7e11056fffaa225c4eaf49abf8081972e7c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These ingredients must be thoroughly mixed,either wet or dry.The ball mill often serves this purpose in addition to its grinding function.

Some shaping processes require high \ufb02uidity; others act on a composition that contains very low water content. At about 50% water by volume, the mixture is a slurry that \ufb02ows like a liquid. As the water content is reduced, increased pressure is required on the paste to produce a similar \ufb02ow. Thus, the shaping processes can be divided according to the consistency of the mixture: (1) slip casting, in which the mixture is a slurry with 25% to 40% water; (2) plastic-forming methods that shape the clay in a plastic condition at 15% to 25% water; (3) semi-dry pressing, in which \r\rFIGURE 16.4 Four categories ofshaping processes used fortraditional ceramics, compared withwater content and pressure requiredto form the clay. \rthe clay is moist (10%\u201315% water) but has low plasticity; and (4) dry pressing, in which the clay is basically dry, containing less than 5% water. Dry clay has no plasticity. The four categories are represented in the chart of Figure 16.4, which compares the categories with the condition of the clay used as starting material. Each category includes several different shaping processes. \rSlip Casting In slip casting, a suspension of ceramic powders in water, called a slip, is poured into a porous plaster of paris (CaSO4\u20132H2O) mold so that water from the mix is gradually absorbed into the plaster to form a \ufb01rm layer of clay at the mold surface. The composition of the slip is typically 25% to 40% water, the remainder being clay often mixed with other ingredients. It must be suf\ufb01ciently \ufb02uid to \ufb02ow into the crevices of the mold cavity, yet lower water content is desirable for faster production rates. Slip casting has two principal variations: drain casting and solid casting. In drain casting, which is the traditional process, the mold is inverted to drain excess slip after the semi-solid layer has been formed, thus leaving a hollow part in the mold; the mold is then opened and the part removed. The sequence, which is very similar to slush casting of metals, is illustrated in Figure 16.5. It is used to make tea pots, vases, art objects, and other hollow-ware products. In solid casting, used to produce solid products, adequate time is allowed for the entire body \rFIGURE 16.5 \rSequence of steps indrain casting, a form ofslip casting: (1) slip ispoured into mold cavity;\r(2)\r water is absorbed into plaster mold toform a \ufb01rm layer; \r\r(3) \rexcess slip is poured out; and (4) part isremoved from mold and trimmed. \r\r\rto become \ufb01rm. Additional slip must be periodically added to account for shrinkage as water is absorbed into the mold. \rPlastic Forming This category includes a variety of methods,both manual and mechanized.They all require the starting mixture to have a plastic consistency, which is generally achieved with 15% to 25% water. Manual methods generally make use of clay at the upper end of the range because it provides a material that is more easily formed; however, this is accompanied by greater shrinkage in drying. Mechanized methods generally employ a mixture with lower water content so that the starting clay is stiffer. \rAlthough manual forming methods date back thousands of years, they are still used today by skilled artisans, either in production or for artworks. Hand modeling involves the creation of the ceramic product by manipulating the mass of plastic clay into the desired geometry. In addition to art pieces, patterns for plaster molds in slip casting are often made this way. Hand molding is a similar method, only a mold or form is used to de\ufb01ne portions of the geometry.

Hand throwing on a potter\u2019s wheel is another re\ufb01nement of the handicraft methods. The potter\u2019s wheel is a round table that rotates on a vertical spindle, powered either by motor or foot-operated treadle. Ceramic products of circular cross section can be formed on the rotating table by throwing and shaping the clay, sometimes using a mold to provide the internal shape. \rStrictly speaking, use of a motor-driven potter\u2019s wheel is a mechanized method. However, most mechanized clay-forming methods are characterized by much less manual participation than the hand-throwing method described above. These more mechanized methods include jiggering, plastic pressing, and extrusion. Jiggering is an extension of the potter\u2019s wheel methods, in which hand throwing is replaced by mechanized techniques. It is used to produce large numbers of identical items such as houseware plates and bowls. Although there are variations in the tools and methods used, re\ufb02ecting different levels of automation and re\ufb01nements to the basic process, a typical sequence is as follows, depicted in Figure 16.6: (1) a wet clay slug is placed on a convex mold; (2) a forming tool is pressed into the slug to provide the initial rough shape\u2014the operation is called batting and the workpiece thus created is called a bat; and (3) a heated jigger tool is used to impart the \ufb01nal contoured shape to the product by pressing the pro\ufb01le into the surface during rotation of the work part.The reason for heating the tool is to produce steam from the wet clay that prevents sticking. Closely related to jiggering is jolleying, in which the basic mold shape is concave, rather than convex [8]. In both of these processes, a rolling tool is sometimes used in place of the nonrotating jigger (or jolley) tool; this rolls the clay into shape, avoiding the need to \ufb01rst bat the slug. \rFIGURE 16.6 \rSequence injiggering: (1) wet clayslug is placed on aconvex mold; (2) batting;and (3) a jigger toolimparts the \ufb01nal product shape. Symbols v and F indicate motion (v  velocity) andapplied force,respectively. \r\r\rPlastic pressing is a forming process in which a plastic clay slug is pressed between upper and lower molds, contained in metal rings. The molds are made of a porous material such as gypsum, so that when a vacuum is drawn on the backs of the mold halves, moisture is removed from the clay. The mold sections are then opened, using positive air pressure to prevent sticking of the part in the mold. Plastic pressing achieves a higher production rate than jiggering and is not limited to radially symmetric parts. \rExtrusion is used in ceramics processing to produce long sections of uniform cross section, which are then cut to required piece length. The extrusion equipment utilizes a screw-type action to assist in mixing the clay and pushing the plastic material through the die opening. This production sequence is widely used to make hollow bricks, shaped tiles, drain pipes, tubes, and insulators. It is also used to make the starting clay slugs for other ceramics processing methods such as jiggering and plastic pressing. \rSemi-dry Pressing In semi-dry pressing, the proportion of water in the starting clay is typically 10% to 15%. This results in low plasticity, precluding the use of plastic forming methods that require a very plastic clay. Semi-dry pressing uses high pressure to overcome the material\u2019s low plasticity and force it to \ufb02ow into a die cavity, as depicted in Figure 16.7.

Binders are usually added to the dry powder mix to provide suf\ufb01cient strength in the pressed part for subsequent handling. Lubricants are also added to prevent die sticking during pressing and ejection. Because dry clay has no plasticity and is very abrasive, there are differences in die design and operating procedures, compared with semi-dry pressing.

The process sequence in dry pressing is similar to semi-dry pressing.Typical products include bathroom tile, electrical insulators, and refractory brick. \r\r\r\r16.1.3 DRYING \rWater plays an important role in most of the traditional ceramics shaping processes. Thereafter, it serves no purpose and must be removed from the body of the clay piece before \ufb01ring. Shrinkage is a problem during this step in the processing sequence because water contributes volume to the piece, and when it is removed, the volume is reduced. The effect can be seen in Figure 16.8. As water is initially added to dry clay, it simply replaces the air in the pores between ceramic grains, and there is no volumetric change. Increasing the water content above a certain point causes the grains to become separated and the volume to grow, resulting in a wet clay that has plasticity and formability. As more water is added, the mixture eventually becomes a liquid suspension of clay particles in water. \rThe reverse of this process occurs in drying. As water is removed from the wet clay, the volume of the piece shrinks. The drying process occurs in two stages, as depicted in Figure 16.9. In the \ufb01rst stage, the rate of drying is rapid and constant, \rFIGURE 16.9 Typical drying rate curve and associated volume reduction (drying shrinkage) for a ceramic body indrying. Drying rate in the second stageof drying is depicted here as a straightline (constant rate decrease as afunction of water content); thefunction is variously shown as concaveor convex in the literature [3], [8]. \r\r\ras water is evaporated from the surface of the clay into the surrounding air, and water from the interior migrates by capillary action toward the surface to replace it. It is during this stage that shrinkage occurs, with the associated risk of warping and cracking because of variations in drying in different sections of the piece. In the second stage of drying, the moisture content has been reduced to where the ceramic grains are in contact, and little or no further shrinkage occurs. The drying process slows, and this is seen in the decreasing rate in the plot. \rIn production, drying is usually accomplished in drying chambers in which temperature and humidity are controlled to achieve the proper drying schedule. Care must be taken so that water is not removed too rapidly, lest large moisture gradients be set up in the piece, making it more prone to crack.

Firing is the heat treatment process that sinters the ceramic material; it is performed in a furnace called a kiln. In sintering, bonds are developed between the ceramic grains, and this is accompanied by densi\ufb01cation and reduction of porosity. Therefore, shrinkage occurs in the polycrystalline material in addition to the shrinkage that has already occurred in drying. Sintering in ceramics is basically the same mechanism as in powder metallurgy. In the \ufb01ring of traditional ceramics, certain chemical reactions between the components in the mixture may also take place, and a glassy phase also forms among the crystals that acts as a binder. Both of these phenomena depend on the chemical composition of the ceramic material and the \ufb01ring temperatures used. \rUnglazed ceramic ware is \ufb01red only once; glazed products are \ufb01red twice. Glazing refers to the application of a ceramic surface coating to make the piece more impervious to water and enhance its appearance (Section 7.2.2). The usual processing sequence with glazed ware is (1) \ufb01re the ware once before glazing to harden the body of the piece, (2) apply the glaze, and (3) \ufb01re the piece a second time to harden the glaze. \r\r\rProcessing of New Ceramics \rMost of the traditional ceramics are based on clay, which possesses a unique capacity to be plastic when mixed with water but hard when dried and \ufb01red. Clay consists of various formulations of hydrous aluminum silicate, usually mixed with other ceramic materials, to form a rather complex chemistry. New ceramics (Section 7.3) are based on simpler chemical compounds,such as oxides,carbides,and nitrides.These materials do not possess the plasticity and formability of traditional clay when mixed with water. Accordingly, other ingredients must be combined with the ceramic powders to achieve plasticity and other desirable properties during forming, so that conventional shaping methods can be used. The new ceramics are generally designed for applications that require higher strength, hardness, and other properties not found in the traditional ceramic materials. These requirements have motivated the introduction of several new processing techniques not previously used for traditional ceramics. \rThe manufacturing sequence for the new ceramics can be summarized in the following steps: (1) preparation of starting materials, (2) shaping, (3) sintering, and \r(4) \ufb01nishing. Although the sequence is nearly the same as for traditional ceramics, the details are often quite different. \r\r16.2.1 PREPARATION OF STARTING MATERIALS \rBecause the strength speci\ufb01ed for these materials is usually much greater than for traditional ceramics, the starting powders must be more homogeneous in size and composition, and particle size must be smaller (strength of the resulting ceramic product is inversely related to grain size). All of this means that greater control of the starting powders is required. Powder preparation includes mechanical and chemical methods. The mechanical methods consist of the same ball mill grinding operations used for traditional ceramics. The trouble with these methods is that the ceramic particles become contaminated from the materials used in the balls and walls of the mill. This compromises the purity of the ceramic powders and results in microscopic \ufb02aws that reduce the strength of the \ufb01nal product.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 17210, "end_char_idx": 21771, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63baed35-6379-4e83-9989-02a1d8cfa084": {"__data__": {"id_": "63baed35-6379-4e83-9989-02a1d8cfa084", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec16.txt", "file_name": "sec16.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 37913, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "514503d3-28b3-463b-b24d-7e9df6b278ce", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec16.txt", "file_name": "sec16.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 37913, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "b23c216a9ca4236d57d91149a05b7bc7e199fa27ab98d6a570361ea15d0deea7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e672310-68ac-481d-a348-e984f43d5ed9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec16.txt", "file_name": "sec16.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 37913, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "9f30834fa9d09f21ce1135b9074ccc15616da4c4ea5992f2ce357eb44c3fc8de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "81115060-048a-411a-a0e7-425f29e96e6a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b389ddfe10ad0ab0f690fb71bae3559a87121f9a6a790542e3514b16a85dd080", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Although the sequence is nearly the same as for traditional ceramics, the details are often quite different. \r\r16.2.1 PREPARATION OF STARTING MATERIALS \rBecause the strength speci\ufb01ed for these materials is usually much greater than for traditional ceramics, the starting powders must be more homogeneous in size and composition, and particle size must be smaller (strength of the resulting ceramic product is inversely related to grain size).

The trouble with these methods is that the ceramic particles become contaminated from the materials used in the balls and walls of the mill. This compromises the purity of the ceramic powders and results in microscopic \ufb02aws that reduce the strength of the \ufb01nal product. \rTwo chemical methods are used to achieve greater homogeneity in the powders of new ceramics: freeze drying and precipitation from solution. In freeze drying, salts of the appropriate starting chemistry are dissolved in water and the solution is sprayed to form small droplets, which are rapidly frozen. The water is then removed from the droplets in a vacuum chamber, and the resulting freeze-dried salt is decomposed by heating to form the ceramic powders. Freeze drying is not applicable to all ceramics, because in some cases a suitable water-soluble salt cannot be identi\ufb01ed as the starting material. \rPrecipitation from solution is another preparation method used for new ceramics. In the typical process, the desired ceramic compound is dissolved from the starting mineral, thus permitting impurities to be \ufb01ltered out. An intermediate compound is then precipitated from solution, which is converted into the desired compound by heating. An example of the precipitation method is the Bayer process for producing high purity alumina (also used in the production of aluminum). In this process, aluminum oxide is dissolved from the mineral bauxite so that iron compounds and other impurities can be removed. Then, aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3) is precipitated from solution and reduced to Al2O3 by heating. \rFurther preparation of the powders includes classi\ufb01cation by size and mixing before shaping. Very \ufb01ne powders are required for new ceramics applications, and so the grains must be separated and classi\ufb01ed according to size. Thorough mixing of the particles, especially when different ceramic powders are combined, is required to avoid segregation. \rVarious additives are often combined with the starting powders, usually in small amounts.The additives include (1) plasticizers to improve plasticity and workability; \r(2) binders to bond the ceramic particles into a solid mass in the \ufb01nal product, (3) wetting agents for better mixing; (4) de\ufb02 occulants, which help to prevent clumping and premature bonding of the powders; and (5) lubricants, to reduce friction between ceramic grains during forming and to reduce sticking during mold release. \r\r\r16.2.2 SHAPING \rMany of the shaping processes for new ceramics are borrowed from powder metallurgy (PM) and traditional ceramics. The PM press and sinter methods discussed in Section 15.3 have been adapted to the new ceramic materials. And some of the traditional ceramics forming techniques (Section 16.1.2) are used to shape the new ceramics, including slip casting, extrusion, and dry pressing. The following processes are not normally associated with the forming of traditional ceramics, although several are associated with PM. \rHot Pressing Hot pressing is similar to dry pressing (Section 16.1.2), except that the process is carried out at elevated temperatures, so that sintering of the product is accomplished simultaneously with pressing. This eliminates the need for a separate \ufb01ring step in the sequence. Higher densities and \ufb01ner grain size are obtained, but die life is reduced by the hot abrasive particles against the die surfaces. \rIsostatic Pressing Isostatic pressing of ceramics is the same process used in powder metallurgy (Section 15.4.1). It uses hydrostatic pressure to compact the ceramic powders from all directions, thus avoiding the problem of nonuniform density in the \ufb01 nal product that is often observed in the traditional uniaxial pressing method. \rDoctor-blade Process This process is used for making thin sheets of ceramic.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 20818, "end_char_idx": 25288, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81115060-048a-411a-a0e7-425f29e96e6a": {"__data__": {"id_": "81115060-048a-411a-a0e7-425f29e96e6a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec16.txt", "file_name": "sec16.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 37913, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "514503d3-28b3-463b-b24d-7e9df6b278ce", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec16.txt", "file_name": "sec16.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 37913, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "b23c216a9ca4236d57d91149a05b7bc7e199fa27ab98d6a570361ea15d0deea7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "63baed35-6379-4e83-9989-02a1d8cfa084", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec16.txt", "file_name": "sec16.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 37913, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4de035220cd3ce70188b69312e76801829130f4ae2cd91ab4591d85c3a12d472", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1f912d28-6002-45e1-98ae-a70d21fda6d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8a9ca662ebcb4ac459b61f034a28a716f762c390daf074e543bb877925b1e85a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Hot Pressing Hot pressing is similar to dry pressing (Section 16.1.2), except that the process is carried out at elevated temperatures, so that sintering of the product is accomplished simultaneously with pressing.

One common application of the sheets is in the electronics industry as a substrate material for integrated circuits.The process is diagrammed in Figure 16.10.A ceramic slurry is introduced onto a moving carrier \ufb01lm such as cellophane. Thickness of the ceramic on the carrier is determined by a wiper, called a doctor-blade. As the slurry moves down the line, it is dried into a \ufb02exible green ceramic tape. At the end of the line, a take-up spool reels in the tape for later processing. In its green condition, the tape can be cut or otherwise shaped before \ufb01ring. \rPowder Injection Molding Powder injection molding (PIM) is the same as the powder metallurgy process (Section 15.4.2), except that the powders are ceramic rather than metallic. Ceramic particles are mixed with a thermoplastic polymer that acts as a carrier and provides the proper \ufb02ow characteristics at molding temperatures. The mix is then heated and injected into a mold cavity. Upon cooling, which hardens the polymer, the mold is opened and the part is removed. Because the temperatures needed to plasticize the carrier are much lower than those required for sintering the ceramic, the piece is green after molding. Before sintering, the plastic \rFIGURE 16.10 The doctor-blade process, used to fabricate thin ceramic sheets. Symbol v indicates motion (v  velocity). \r\rbinder must be removed. This is called debinding, which is usually accomplished by a combination of thermal and solvent treatments. \rApplications of ceramic PIM are currently inhibited by dif\ufb01culties in debinding and sintering. Burning off the polymer is relatively slow, and its removal signi\ufb01cantly weakens the green strength of the molded part. Warping and cracking often occur during sintering. Further, ceramic products made by powder injection molding are especially vulnerable to microstructural \ufb02aws that limit their strength. \r\r\r16.2.3 SINTERING \rBecause the plasticity needed to shape the new ceramics is not normally based on a water mixture, the drying step so commonly required to remove water from the traditional green ceramics can be omitted in the processing of most new ceramic products.The sintering step,however,is still very much required to obtain maximum possible strength and hardness. The functions of sintering are the same as before, to \r(1) bond individual grains into a solid mass, (2) increase density, and (3) reduce or eliminate porosity. \rTemperatures around 80% to 90% of the melting temperature of the material are commonly used in sintering ceramics.Sintering mechanisms differ somewhat between the new ceramics, which are based predominantly on a single chemical compound (e.g.,Al2O3),and the clay-based ceramics,which usually consist of several compounds having different melting points.

Finishing operations usually involve grinding and other abrasive processes (Chapter 24). Diamond abrasives must be used to cut the hardened ceramic materials. \r\r\r\rProcessing of Cermets \rMany metal matrix composites (MMCs) and ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) are processed by particulate processing methods. The most prominent examples are cemented carbides and other cermets. \r\r16.3.1 CEMENTED CARBIDES \rThe cemented carbides are a family of composite materials consisting of carbide ceramic particles embedded in a metallic binder. They are classi\ufb01ed as metal matrix composites because the metallic binder is the matrix that holds the bulk material together; however, the carbide particles constitute the largest proportion of the composite material, normally ranging between 80% and 96% by volume. Cemented carbides are technically classi\ufb01ed as cermets, although they are often distinguished from the other materials in this class. \r\rThe most important cemented carbide is tungsten carbide in a cobalt binder (WC\u2013Co). Generally included within this category are certain mixtures of WC, TiC, and TaC in a Co matrix, in which tungsten carbide is the major component. Other cemented carbides include titanium carbide in nickel (TiC\u2013Ni) and chromium carbide in nickel (Cr3C2\u2013Ni). These composites are discussed in Section 9.2.1, and the carbide ingredients are described in Section 7.3.2. The present discussion is directed at the particulate processing of cemented carbide. \rTo provide a strong and pore-free part, the carbide powders must be sintered with a metal binder. Cobalt works best with WC, whereas nickel is better with TiC and Cr3C2. The usual proportion of binder metal is from around 4% up to 20%. Powders of carbide and binder metal are thoroughly mixed wet in a ball mill (or other suitable mixing machine) to form a homogeneous sludge. Milling also serves to re\ufb01 ne particle size.The sludge is then dried in a vacuum or controlled atmosphere to prevent oxidation in preparation for compaction. \rCompaction Various methods are used to shape the powder mix into a green compact of the desired geometry. The most common process is cold pressing, described earlier and used for high production of cemented carbide parts such as cutting tool inserts. The dies used in cold pressing must be made oversized to account for shrinkage during sintering. Linear shrinkage can be 20% or more. For high production, the dies themselves are made with WC\u2013Co liners to reduce wear, because of the abrasive nature of carbide particles. For smaller quantities, large \ufb02at sections are sometimes pressed and then cut into smaller pieces of the speci\ufb01 ed size. \rOther compaction methods used for cemented carbide products include isostatic pressing and hot pressing for large pieces, such as draw dies and ball mill balls; and extrusion, for long sections of circular, rectangular, or other cross section. Each of these processes has been described previously, either in this or the preceding chapter. \rSintering Although it is possible to sinter WC and TiC without a binder metal, the resulting material is somewhat less than 100% of true density. Use of a binder yields a structure that is virtually free of porosity. \rSintering of WC\u2013Co involves liquid phase sintering (Section 15.4.5).

The process can be explained with reference to the binary phase diagram for these constituents in Figure 16.11.

The usual sintering temperatures for WC\u2013Co are in the range 1370 to 1425\u00b0C (2500\u20132600\u00b0F), which is below cobalt\u2019s melting point of 1495\u00b0C (2716\u00b0F). Thus, the pure binder metal does not melt at the sintering temperature.However,as the phase diagram shows,WC dissolves in Co in the solid state. During the heat treatment, WC is gradually dissolved into the gamma phase, and its melting point is reduced so that melting \ufb01 nally occurs. As the liquid phase forms, it \ufb02 ows and wets theWC particles,further dissolving the solid.The presence of the molten metal also serves to remove gases from the internal regions of the compact.These mechanisms combine to effect a rearrangement of the remaining WC particles into a closer packing, which results in signi\ufb01 cant densi\ufb01 cation and shrinkage of the WC\u2013Co \rTypical composition rangeof cemented carbide products \r\r1800 1600 \r1400 \r1200\rTemperature, \u00baC \r1000 \rFIGURE 16.11 \rWC\u2013Co phase diagram.\r(Source: [7]).

Later, during cooling in the sintering cycle, the dissolved carbide is precipitated and deposited onto the existing crystals to form a coherent WC skeleton, throughout which the Co binder is embedded. \rSecondary Operations Subsequent processing is usually required after sintering to achieve adequate dimensional control of cemented carbide parts.

Chromium is a common metal binder used in these composite materials. The ceramic-to-metal proportions cover a wider range than those of the cemented carbides; in some cases, the metal is the major ingredient. These cermets are formed into useful products by the same basic shaping methods used for cemented carbides. \rThe current technology of ceramic matrix composites (Section 9.3) includes ceramic materials (e.g., Al2O3, BN, Si3N4, and glass) reinforced by \ufb01bers of carbon, SiC, or Al2O3. If the \ufb01bers are whiskers (\ufb01bers consisting of single crystals), these CMCs can be processed by particulate methods used for new ceramics (Section 16.2). \r\r\r\r\rProduct Design Considerations \rCeramic materials have special properties that make them attractive to designers if the application is right. The following design recommendations, compiled from Bralla [2] and other sources, apply to both new and traditional ceramic materials, although designers are more likely to \ufb01nd opportunities for new ceramics in engineered products. In general, the same guidelines apply to cemented carbides. \r\r\u27a2 \rCeramic materials are several times stronger in compression than in tension; accordingly, ceramic components should be designed to be subjected to compressive stresses, not tensile stresses. \r\r\u27a2 \rCeramics are brittle and possess almost no ductility.

The metal therefore deforms to take a shape determined by the geometry of the die. Metal forming dominates the class of shaping operations identi\ufb01 ed in Chapter 1 as the deformation processes (Figure 1.5). \rStresses applied to plastically deform the metal are usually compressive. However, some forming processes stretch the metal, while others bend the metal, and still others apply shear stresses to the metal. To be successfully formed, a metal must possess certain properties. Desirable properties include low yield strength and high ductility.These properties are affected by temperature. Ductility is increased and yield strength is reduced when work temperature is raised. The effect of temperature gives rise to distinctions between cold working, warm working, and hot working. Strain rate and friction are additional factors that affect performance in metal forming.All of these issues are examined in this chapter, following an overview of the metal forming processes. \r\r\r\r\rOverview of Metal Forming \rMetal forming processes can be classi\ufb01ed into two basic categories: bulk deformation processes and sheet metalworking processes. These two categories are covered in detail in Chapters 18 and 19, respectively. Each category includes several major classes of shaping operations, as indicated in Figure 17.1. \r\r\rBulk Deformation Processes Bulk deformation processes are generally characterized by signi\ufb01cant deformations and massive shape changes, and the surface area\u2013 to\u2013volume of the work is relatively small. The term bulk describes the work parts that have this low area\u2013to\u2013volume ratio. Starting work shapes for these processes include cylindrical billets and rectangular bars. Figure 17.2 illustrates the following basic operations in bulk deformation: \r\u27a2 \rRolling. This is a compressive deformation process in which the thickness of a slab or plate is reduced by two opposing cylindrical tools called rolls. The rolls rotate so as to draw the work into the gap between them and squeeze it. \r\r\u27a2 \rForging. In forging, a workpiece is compressed between two opposing dies, so that the die shapes are imparted to the work. Forging is traditionally a hot working process, but many types of forging are performed cold. \r\r\u27a2 \rExtrusion. This is a compression process in which the work metal is forced to \ufb02ow through a die opening, thereby taking the shape of the opening as its own cross section. \r\r\u27a2 \rDrawing. In this forming process, the diameter of a round wire or bar is reduced by pulling it through a die opening. \r\r\rSheet Metalworking Sheet metalworking processes are forming and cutting operations performed on metal sheets, strips, and coils. The surface area\u2013to\u2013volume ratio of the starting metal is high; thus, this ratio is a useful means to distinguish bulk deformation from sheet metal processes. Pressworking is the term often applied to sheet metal operations because the machines used to perform these operations are \r\r\r(b)\r forging,\r\r(c)\r extrusion, and \r\r(d)\r drawing. Relativemotion in the operations is indicatedby v; forces are indicated by F. \r\r\r\rpresses (presses of various types are also used in other manufacturing processes). A part produced in a sheet metal operation is often called a stamping. \rSheet metal operations are always performed as cold working processes and are usually accomplished using a set of tools called a punch and die. The punch is the positive portion and the die is the negative portion of the tool set. The basic sheet metal operations are sketched in Figure 17.3 and are de\ufb01ned as follows: \r\u27a2 \rBending. Bending involves straining of a metal sheet or plate to take an angle along a (usually) straight axis. \r\r\u27a2 \rDrawing.

In sheet metalworking, drawing refers to the forming of a \ufb02at metal sheet into a hollow or concave shape, such as a cup, by stretching the metal. A blankholder is used to hold down the blank while the punch pushes into the sheet metal, as shown in Figure 17.3(b). To distinguish this operation from bar and wire drawing, the terms cup drawing or deep drawing are often used. \r\r\u27a2 \rShearing. This process seems somewhat out-of-place in a list of deformation processes, because it involves cutting rather than forming. A shearing operation cuts the work using a punch and die, as in Figure 17.3(c). Although it is not a forming process, it is included here because it is a necessary and very common operation in sheet metalworking. \r\r\rThe miscellaneous processes within the sheet metalworking classi\ufb01cation in Figure 17.1 include a variety of related shaping processes that do not use punch and die tooling. Examples of these processes are stretch forming, roll bending, spinning, and bending of tube stock. \r(b) drawing, and (c)shearing: (1) as punch\ufb01rst contacts sheet, and (2) after cutting.Force and relative motion in these operations areindicated by F and v. \r\r\r\r\rMaterial Behavior in Metal Forming \rConsiderable insight about the behavior of metals during forming can be obtained from the stress\u2013strain curve.The typical stress\u2013strain curve for most metals is divided into an elastic region and a plastic region (Section 3.1.1). In metal forming, the plastic region is of primary interest because the material is plastically and permanently deformed in these processes. \rThe typical stress\u2013strain relationship for a metal exhibits elasticity below the yield point and strain hardening above it. Figures 3.4 and 3.5 indicate this behavior in linear and logarithmic axes. In the plastic region, the metal\u2019s behavior is expressed by the \ufb02ow curve: \rs ! Ken \rwhere K ! the strength coef\ufb01cient, MPa (lb/in2); and n is the strain hardening exponent. The stress s and strain e in the \ufb02ow curve are true stress and true strain. The \ufb02ow curve is generally valid as a relationship that de\ufb01nes a metal\u2019s plastic behavior in cold working. Typical values of K and n for different metals at room temperature are listed in Table 3.4. \rFlow Stress The \ufb02ow curve describes the stress\u2013strain relationship in the region in which metal forming takes place. It indicates the \ufb02ow stress of the metal\u2014the \r\rstrength property that determines forces and power required to accomplish a particular forming operation. For most metals at room temperature, the stress\u2013strain plot of Figure 3.5 indicates that as the metal is deformed, its strength increases due to strain hardening. The stress required to continue deformation must be increased to match this increase in strength. Flow stress is de\ufb01ned as the instantaneous value of stress required to continue deforming the material\u2014to keep the metal \u201c\ufb02owing.\u201d It is the yield strength of the metal as a function of strain, which can be expressed: \rYf ! Ken (17.1) \r\rwhere Yf  \ufb02ow stress, MPa (lb/in2). \rIn the individual forming operations discussed in the following two chapters, the instantaneous \ufb02ow stress can be used to analyze the process as it is occurring. For example, in certain forging operations, the instantaneous force during compression can be determined from the \ufb02ow stress value. Maximum force can be calculated based on the \ufb02ow stress that results from the \ufb01nal strain at the end of the forging stroke. \rIn other cases, the analysis is based on the average stresses and strains that occur during deformation rather than instantaneous values.

Maximum force can be calculated based on the \ufb02ow stress that results from the \ufb01nal strain at the end of the forging stroke. \rIn other cases, the analysis is based on the average stresses and strains that occur during deformation rather than instantaneous values. Extrusion represents this case, Figure 17.2(c). As the billet is reduced in cross section to pass through the extrusion die opening, the metal gradually strain hardens to reach a maximum value. Rather than determine a sequence of instantaneous stress\u2013strain values during the reduction, which would be not only dif\ufb01cult but also of limited interest, it is more useful to analyze the process based on the average \ufb02ow stress during deformation. \rAverage Flow Stress The average \ufb02ow stress (also called the mean \ufb02ow stress) is the average value of stress over the stress\u2013strain curve from the beginning of strain to the \ufb01nal (maximum) value that occurs during deformation.The value is illustrated in the stress\u2013strain plot of Figure 17.4.The average \ufb02ow stress is determined by integrating the \ufb02ow curve equation, Equation (17.1), between zero and the \ufb01nal strain value de\ufb01ning the range of interest. This yields the equation: \rKen \rYf ! (17.2)\r1 \" n where Yf ! average \ufb02ow stress, MPa (lb/in2); and e ! maximum strain value during the deformation process. \r\r\r\rExtensive use is made of the average \ufb02ow stress in the study of the bulk deformation processes in the following chapter. Given values of K and n for the work material, a method of computing \ufb01nal strain will be developed for each process. Based on this strain, Equation (17.2) can be used to determine the average \ufb02ow stress to which the metal is subjected during the operation. \r\r\rTemperature in Metal Forming \rThe \ufb02ow curve is a valid representation of stress\u2013strain behavior of a metal during plastic deformation, particularly for cold working operations. For any metal, the values of K and n depend on temperature. Strength and strain hardening are both reduced at higher temperatures.These property changes are important because they result in lower forces and power during forming. In addition, ductility is increased at higher temperatures, which allows greater plastic deformation of the work metal. Three temperature ranges used in metal forming can be distinguished: cold, warm, and hot working. \rCold Working Cold working (also known as cold forming) is metal forming performed at room temperature or slightly above. Signi\ufb01cant advantages of cold forming compared to hot working are (1) greater accuracy, meaning closer tolerances can be achieved; (2) better surface \ufb01nish; (3) higher strength and hardness of the part due to strain hardening; (4) grain \ufb02ow during deformation provides the opportunity for desirable directional properties to be obtained in the resulting product; and (5) no heating of the work is required, which saves on furnace and fuel costs and permits higher production rates. Owing to this combination of advantages, many cold forming processes have become important mass-production operations. They provide close tolerances and good surfaces, minimizing the amount of machining required so that these operations can be classi\ufb01ed as net shape or near net shape processes (Section 1.3.1). \rThere are certain disadvantages or limitations associated with cold forming operations: (1) higher forces and power are required to perform the operation; (2) care must be taken to ensure that the surfaces of the starting workpiece are free of scale and dirt; and (3) ductility and strain hardening of the work metal limit the amount of forming that can be done to the part.

In some operations, the metal must be annealed (Section 26.1) in order to allow further deformation to be accomplished. In other cases, the metal is simply not ductile enough to be cold worked. \rTo overcome the strain hardening problem and reduce force and power requirements, many forming operations are performed at elevated temperatures. There are two elevated temperature ranges involved, giving rise to the terms warm working and hot working. \rWarm Working Because plastic deformation properties are normally enhanced by increasing workpiece temperature, forming operations are sometimes performed at temperatures somewhat above room temperature but below the recrystallization temperature. The term warm working is applied to this second temperature range. The dividing line between cold working and warm working is often expressed in terms of the melting point for the metal.The dividing line is usually taken to be 0.3Tm, where Tm is the melting point (absolute temperature) for the particular metal. \r\rThe lower strength and strain hardening at the intermediate temperatures, as well as higher ductility, provide warm working with the following advantages over cold working: (1) lower forces and power, (2) more intricate work geometries possible, and (3) need for annealing may be reduced or eliminated. \rHot Working Hot working (also called hot forming) involves deformation at temperatures above the recrystallization temperature (Section 3.3). The recrystallization temperature for a given metal is about one-half of its melting point on the absolute scale. In practice, hot working is usually carried out at temperatures somewhat above 0.5Tm. The work metal continues to soften as temperature is increased beyond 0.5Tm, thus enhancing the advantage of hot working above this level. However, the deformation process itself generates heat, which increases work temperatures in localized regions of the part. This can cause melting in these regions, which is highly undesirable. Also, scale on the work surface is accelerated at higher temperatures.Accordingly,hot working temperatures are usually maintained within the range 0.5Tm to 0.75Tm. \rThe most signi\ufb01cant advantage of hot working is the capability to produce substantial plastic deformation of the metal\u2014far more than is possible with cold working or warm working. The principal reason for this is that the \ufb02 ow curve of the hot-worked metal has a strength coef\ufb01cient that is substantially less than at room temperature, the strain hardening exponent is zero (at least theoretically), and the ductility of the metal is signi\ufb01cantly increased.All of this results in the following advantages relative to cold working: (1) the shape of the work part can be signi\ufb01 cantly altered, (2) lower forces and power are required to deform the metal, (3) metals that usually fracture in cold working can be hot formed, (4) strength properties are generally isotropic because of the absence of the oriented grain structure typically created in cold work-ing,and (5) no strengthening of the part occurs from work hardening.This last advantage may seem inconsistent, since strengthening of the metal is often considered an advantage for cold working. However, there are applications in which it is undesirable for the metal to be work hardened because it reduces ductility, for example, if the part is to be subsequently processed by cold forming. Disadvantages of hot working include (1) lower dimensional accuracy, (2) higher total energy required (due to the thermal energy to heat the workpiece), (3) work surface oxidation (scale), (4) poorer surface \ufb01nish, and (5) shorter tool life. \rRecrystallization of the metal in hot working involves atomic diffusion, which is a time-dependent process. Metal forming operations are often performed at high speeds that do not allow suf\ufb01cient time for complete recrystallization of the grain structure during the deformation cycle itself. However, because of the high temperatures, recrystallization eventually does occur. It may occur immediately following the forming process or later, as the workpiece cools.

Even though recrystallization may occur after the actual deformation, its eventual occurrence, and the substantial softening of the metal at high temperatures, are the features that distinguish hot working from warm working or cold working. \rIsothermal Forming Certain metals, such as highly alloyed steels, many titanium alloys, and high-temperature nickel alloys, possess good hot hardness, a property that makes them useful for high-temperature service. However, this very property that makes them attractive in these applications also makes them dif\ufb01 cult to form with conventional methods. The problem is that when these metals are heated to their hot working temperatures and then come in contact with the relatively cold forming tools, heat is quickly transferred away from the part surfaces, thus raising the strength in these regions. The variations in temperature and strength in different regions of the workpiece cause irregular \ufb02ow patterns in the metal during deformation, leading to high residual stresses and possible surface cracking. \r\rIsothermal forming refers to forming operations that are carried out in such a way as to eliminate surface cooling and the resulting thermal gradients in the work part. It is accomplished by preheating the tools that come in contact with the part to the same temperature as the work metal. This weakens the tools and reduces tool life, but it avoids the problems described above when these dif\ufb01cult metals are formed by conventional methods. In some cases, isothermal forming represents the only way in which these work materials can be formed.The procedure is most closely associated with forging, and isothermal forging is discussed in the following chapter. \r\r\rStrain Rate Sensitivity \rTheoretically, a metal in hot working behaves like a perfectly plastic material, with strain hardening exponent n  0. This means that the metal should continue to \ufb02 ow under the same level of \ufb02 ow stress, once that stress level is reached. However, there is an additional phenomenon that characterizes the behavior of metals during deformation,especially at the elevated temperatures of hot working.That phenomenon is strain rate sensitivity. Discussion of this topic begins with a de\ufb01 nition of strain rate. \rThe rate at which the metal is strained in a forming process is directly related to the speed of deformation v. In many forming operations, deformation speed is equal to the velocity of the ram or other moving element of the equipment. It is most easily visualized in a tensile test as the velocity of the testing machine head relative to its \ufb01xed base. Given the deformation speed, strain rate is de\ufb01ned: \r. \r! __v \re (17.3)\rh \r.\rwhere e ! true strain rate, m/s/m (in/sec/in), or simply s1; and h ! instantaneous height of the workpiece being deformed, m (in). If deformation speed v is constant during the operation, strain rate will change as h changes. In most practical forming operations, valuation of strain rate is complicated by the geometry of the work part and variations in strain rate in different regions of the part. Strain rate can reach 1000 s1 or more for some metal forming processes such as high-speed rolling and forging. \rIt has already been observed that the \ufb02ow stress of a metal is a function of temperature.At the temperatures of hot working,\ufb02ow stress depends on strain rate.The effect of strain rate on strength properties is known as strain rate sensitivity. The effect can be seen in Figure 17.5. As strain rate is increased, resistance to deformation increases. This usually plots approximately as a straight line on a log\u2013log graph, thus leading to the relationship: \rYf !

Increasing temperature decreases the value of C (consistent with its effect on K in the \ufb02ow curve equation) and increases the value of m.The general result can be seen in Figure 17.6. At room temperature, the effect of strain rate is almost negligible, indicating that the \ufb02ow curve is a good representation of the material behavior. As temperature is increased, strain rate plays a more important role in determining \ufb02ow stress, as indicated by the steeper slopes of the strain rate relationships. This is important in hot working because deformation resistance of the material increases so dramatically as strain rate is increased.To give a sense of the effect,typical values of m for the three temperature ranges of metal working are given in Table 17.1. \rThus, even in cold working, strain rate can have an effect, if small, on \ufb02ow stress. In hot working, the effect can be signi\ufb01cant. A more complete expression for \ufb02ow stress as a function of both strain and strain rate would be the following: \rFIGURE 17.6 Effect of temperature on \ufb02ow stress for a typical metal.

Of course, A, n, and m would all be functions of temperature, and the enormous task of testing and compiling the values of these parameters for different metals and various temperatures would be forbidding. \rIn the coverage of the bulk deformation processes in Chapter 18, many of which are performed hot, the effect of strain rate is neglected in analyzing forces and power. For cold working and warm working, and for hot working operations at relatively low deformation speeds, this neglect represents a reasonable assumption. \r\r\rFriction and Lubrication in Metal Forming \rFriction in metal forming arises because of the close contact between the tool and work surfaces and the high pressures that drive the surfaces together in these operations. In most metal forming processes, friction is undesirable for the following reasons: (1) metal \ufb02ow in the work is retarded, causing residual stresses and sometimes defects in the product; (2) forces and power to perform the operation are increased, and (3) tool wear can lead to loss of dimensional accuracy, resulting in defective parts and requiring replacement of the tooling. Since tools in metal forming are generally expensive, tool wear is a major concern. Friction and tool wear are more severe in hot working because of the much harsher environment. \rFriction in metal forming is different from that encountered in most mechanical systems, such as gear trains, shafts and bearings, and other components involving relative motion between surfaces. These other cases are generally characterized by low contact pressures, low to moderate temperatures, and ample lubrication to minimize metal-to-metal contact. By contrast, the metal forming environment features high pressures between a hardened tool and a soft work part, plastic deformation of the softer material, and high temperatures (at least in hot working). These conditions can result in relatively high coef\ufb01cients of friction in metal working, even in the presence of lubricants.

Sticking in metalworking (also called sticking friction) is the tendency for the two surfaces in relative motion to adhere to each other rather than slide. It means that the friction stress between the surfaces exceeds the shear \ufb02ow stress of the work metal, thus causing the metal to deform by a shear process beneath the surface rather than slip at the surface. Sticking occurs in metal forming operations and is a prominent problem in rolling; it is discussed in that context in the following chapter. \r\rMetalworking lubricants are applied to the tool\u2014work interface in many forming operations to reduce the harmful effects of friction. Bene\ufb01ts include reduced sticking, forces, power, and tool wear; and better surface \ufb01nish on the product. Lubricants also serve other functions, such as removing heat from the tooling. Considerations in choosing an appropriate metalworking lubricant include (1) type of forming process (rolling, forging, sheet metal drawing, and so on), (2) whether used in hot working or cold working, (3) work material, (4) chemical reactivity with the tool and work metals (it is generally desirable for the lubricant to adhere to the surfaces to be most effective in reducing friction), (5) ease of application, (6) toxicity, (7) \ufb02ammability, and (8) cost. \rLubricants used for cold working operations include [4], [7] mineral oils, fats and fatty oils, water-based emulsions, soaps, and other coatings. Hot working is sometimes performed dry for certain operations and materials (e.g., hot rolling of steel and extrusion of aluminum). When lubricants are used in hot working, they include mineral oils, graphite, and glass. Molten glass becomes an effective lubricant for hot extrusion of steel alloys. Graphite contained in water or mineral oil is a common lubricant for hot forging of various work materials.

The starting forms include cylindrical bars and billets, rectangular billets and slabs,and similar elementary geometries.The bulk deformation processes re\ufb01ne the starting shapes, sometimes improving mechanical properties, and always adding commercial value. Deformation processes work by stressing the metal suf\ufb01 ciently to cause it to plastically \ufb02ow into the desired shape. \rBulk deformation processes are performed as cold, warm, and hot working operations. Cold and warm working are appropriate when the shape change is less severe, and there is a need to improve mechanical properties and achieve good \ufb01nish on the part. Hot working is generally required when massive deformation of large work parts is involved. \rThe commercial and technological importance of bulk deformation processes derives from the following: \r\u27a2 \rWhen performed as hot working operations, they can achieve signi\ufb01cant change in the shape of the work part. \r\r\u27a2 \rWhen performed as cold working operations, they can be used not only to shape the product, but also to increase its strength through strain hardening. \r\r\u27a2 \rThese processes produce little or no waste as a byproduct of the operation. Some bulk deformation operations are near net shape or net shape processes; they achieve \ufb01nal product geometry with little or no subsequent machining. \r\r\rThe bulk deformation processes covered in this chapter are (1) rolling, (2) forging, (3) extrusion, and \r(4) wire and bar drawing. The chapter also documents the variations and related operations of the four basic processes that have been developed over the years. \r\r\r\r\r\rRolling \rRolling is a deformation process in which the thickness of the work is reduced by compressive forces exerted by two opposing rolls. The rolls rotate as illustrated in Figure 18.1 to pull and simultaneously squeeze the work between them. The basic process shown in the \ufb01gure is \ufb02at rolling, used to reduce the thickness of a rectangular cross section.A closely related process is shape rolling,in which a square cross section is formed into a shape such as an I-beam. \rMost rolling processes are very capital intensive, requiring massive pieces of equipment, called rolling mills, to perform them. The high investment cost requires the mills to be used for production in large quantities of standard items such as sheets and plates. Most rolling is carried out by hot working, called hot rolling, owing to the large amount of deformation required. Hot-rolled metal is generally free of residual stresses, and its properties are isotropic. Disadvantages of hot rolling are that the product cannot be held to close tolerances, and the surface has a characteristic oxide scale. \rSteelmaking provides the most common application of rolling mill operations (Historical Note 18.1). The sequence of steps in a steel rolling mill illustrates the variety of products made. Similar steps occur in other basic metal industries. The work starts out as a cast steel ingot that has just solidi\ufb01ed. While it is still hot, the ingot is placed in a furnace where it remains for many hours until it has reached a uniform temperature throughout, so that the metal will \ufb02 ow consistently during rolling. For steel, the desired temperature for rolling is around 1200\u00b0C (2200\u00b0F).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4102, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1453dfa1-cceb-4680-996a-13521d792226": {"__data__": {"id_": "1453dfa1-cceb-4680-996a-13521d792226", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec18.txt", "file_name": "sec18.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 93042, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a0a271ae-5c39-445c-afcc-5c66648375ea", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec18.txt", "file_name": "sec18.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 93042, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "f8f80264700db35b05450f866bdec046a03cb8198dea72b9fae5a6e0ab0afa27", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6137ffc7-9f8d-4469-9269-2cbce9fa8a33", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec18.txt", "file_name": "sec18.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 93042, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "c0509289bb7e8e0266c1959a51d33d25f0bb42ba611ad973373212f0641a1d04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dab0b485-3322-4e9f-92b8-3f55718502da", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "72442661669f65b2c1dd2094378f1ec9bc205429b3a36c2c20be7e5b01d59963", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Hot-rolled metal is generally free of residual stresses, and its properties are isotropic.

For steel, the desired temperature for rolling is around 1200\u00b0C (2200\u00b0F). The heating operation is called soaking, and the furnaces in which it is carried out are called soaking pits. \rFrom soaking, the ingot is moved to the rolling mill, where it is rolled into one of three intermediate shapes called blooms,billets,or slabs.A bloom has a square cross section 150 mm ! 150 mm (6 in ! 6 in) or larger. A slab is rolled from an ingot or a bloom and has a rectangular cross section of width 250 mm (10 in) or more and thickness 40 mm (1.5 in) or more. A billet is rolled from a bloom and is square with dimensions 40 mm (1.5 in) on a side or larger. These intermediate shapes are subsequently rolled into \ufb01nal product shapes. \rBlooms are rolled into structural shapes and rails for railroad tracks. Billets are rolled into bars and rods. These shapes are the raw materials for machining, wire drawing, forging, and other metalworking processes. Slabs are rolled into plates, sheets, and strips. Hot-rolled plates are used in shipbuilding, bridges, boilers, welded structures for various heavy machines, tubes and pipes, and many other products. \r\r\rFigure 18.2 shows some of these rolled steel products. Further \ufb02attening of hot-rolled plates and sheets is often accomplished by cold rolling, in order to prepare them for subsequent sheet metal operations (Chapter 19). Cold rolling strengthens the metal and permits a tighter tolerance on thickness. In addition, the surface of the cold-rolled sheet is absent of scale and generally superior to the corresponding hot-rolled product. These characteristics make cold-rolled sheets, strips, and coils ideal for stampings, exterior panels, and other parts of products ranging from automobiles to appliances and of\ufb01ce furniture. \r\rHistorical Note 18.1 Rolling \rRolling of gold and silver by manual methods dates from the fourteenth century. Leonardo da Vinci designed one of the \ufb01 rst rolling mills in 1480, but it is doubtful that his design was ever built. By around 1600, cold rolling of lead and tin was accomplished on manually operated rolling mills. By around 1700, hot rolling of iron was being done in Belgium, England, France, Germany, and Sweden. These mills were used to roll iron bars into sheets. Prior to this time, the only rolls in steelmaking were slitting mills\u2014pairs of opposing rolls with collars (cutting disks) used to slit iron and steel into narrow strips for making nails and similar products. Slitting mills were not intended to reduce thickness. \rModern rolling practice dates from 1783 when a patent was issued in England for using grooved rolls to produce iron bars. The Industrial Revolution created a tremendous demand for iron and steel, stimulating developments in rolling. The \ufb01rst mill for rolling railway rails was started in 1820 in England. The \ufb01rst I-beams were rolled in France in 1849. In addition, the size and capacity of \ufb02 at rolling mills increased dramatically during this period. \rRolling is a process that requires a very large power source. Water wheels were used to power rolling mills until the eighteenth century. Steam engines increased the capacity of these rolling mills until soon after 1900 when electric motors replaced steam. \r\r\r18.1.1 FLAT ROLLING AND ITS ANALYSIS \rFlat rolling is illustrated in Figures 18.1 and 18.3.

It involves the rolling of slabs, strips, sheets, and plates\u2014work parts of rectangular cross section in which the width is greater than the thickness. In \ufb02at rolling, the work is squeezed between two rolls so that its thickness is reduced by an amount called the draft: \rd \" to # tf (18.1) \r\rwhere d \" draft, mm (in); to \" starting thickness, mm (in); and tf  \ufb01nal thickness, mm (in). Draft is sometimes expressed as a fraction of the starting stock thickness, called the reduction: \r__ d\rr \" (18.2)\rto \r\rwhere r \" reduction.When a series of rolling operations are used,reduction is taken as the sum of the drafts divided by the original thickness. \rIn addition to thickness reduction, rolling usually increases work width. This is called spreading, and it tends to be most pronounced with low width-to-thickness ratios and low coef\ufb01cients of friction. Conservation of matter is preserved, so the volume of metal exiting the rolls equals the volume entering: \rtowoLo \" tfwfLf (18.3) \r\rwhere wo and wf are the before and after work widths, mm (in); and Lo and Lf are the before and after work lengths, mm (in). Similarly, before and after volume rates of material \ufb02ow must be the same, so the before and after velocities can be related: \rtowovo \" tfwfvf (18.4) \r\rwhere vo and vf are the entering and exiting velocities of the work. \r\rThe rolls contact the work along an arc de\ufb01ned by the angle u. Each roll has radius R, and its rotational speed gives it a surface velocity vr. This velocity is greater than the entering speed of the work vo and less than its exiting speed vf . Since the metal \ufb02ow is continuous, there is a gradual change in velocity of the work between the rolls. However, there is one point along the arc where work velocity equals roll velocity. This is called the no-slip point, also known as the neutral point. On either side of this point, slipping and friction occur between roll and work. The amount of slip between the rolls and the work can be measured by means of the forward slip,a term used in rolling that is de\ufb01 ned: \rvf # vr \rs \" (18.5)\rvr \rwhere s \" forward slip; vf  \ufb01nal (exiting) work velocity, m/s (ft/sec); and vr \" roll speed, m/s (ft/sec). \rThe true strain experienced by the work in rolling is based on before and after stock thicknesses. In equation form, \r__ to \re  ln (18.6)\rtf \rThe true strain can be used to determine the average \ufb02ow stress Yf applied to the work material in \ufb02at rolling.

On the entrance side of the no-slip point, friction force is in one direction, and on the other side it is in the opposite direction. However, the two forces are not equal. The friction force on the entrance side is greater, so that the net force pulls the work through the rolls.

The friction force on the entrance side is greater, so that the net force pulls the work through the rolls. If this were not the case, rolling would not be possible. There is a limit to the maximum possible draft that can be accomplished in \ufb02at rolling with a given coef\ufb01cient of friction, de\ufb01ned by: \rdmax \" m2R (18.8) \rwhere dmax  maximum draft, mm (in); m  coef\ufb01cient of friction; and R  roll radius mm (in).The equation indicates that if friction were zero,draft would be zero,and it would be impossible to accomplish the rolling operation. \rCoef\ufb01cient of friction in rolling depends on lubrication, work material, and working temperature. In cold rolling, the value is around 0.1; in warm working, a typical value is around 0.2; and in hot rolling, m is around 0.4 [16]. Hot rolling is often characterized by a condition called sticking, in which the hot work surface adheres to the rolls over the contact arc.This condition often occurs in the rolling of steels and high-temperature alloys. When sticking occurs, the coef\ufb01cient of friction can be as high as 0.7. The consequence of sticking is that the surface layers of the work are restricted to move at the same speed as the roll speed vr; and below the surface, deformation is more severe in order to allow passage of the piece through the roll gap. \r\r\rGiven a coef\ufb01cient of friction suf\ufb01cient to perform rolling, roll force F required to maintain separation between the two rolls can be computed by integrating the unit roll pressure (shown as p in Figure 18.3) over the roll-work contact area. This can be expressed: \rL \rF \" w ! pdL (18.9) \r0 \r\rwhere F  rolling force, N (lb); w  the width of the work being rolled, mm (in); p  roll pressure, MPa (lb/in2); and L \" length of contact between rolls and work, mm (in). The integration requires two separate terms, one for either side of the neutral point. Variation in roll pressure along the contact length is signi\ufb01 cant. A sense of this variation can be obtained from the plot in Figure 18.4. Pressure reaches a maximum at the neutral point,and trails off on either side to the entrance and exit points. As friction increases, maximum pressure increases relative to entrance and exit values. As friction decreases, the neutral point shifts away from the entrance and toward the exit in order to maintain a net pull force in the direction of rolling. Otherwise, with low friction, the work would slip rather than pass between the rolls. \rAn approximation of the results obtained by Equation (18.9) can be calculated based on the average \ufb02ow stress experienced by the work material in the roll gap. That is, \rF \" YfwL (18.10) \r\rwhere Yf \" average \ufb02ow stress from Equation (18.7), MPa (lb/in2); and the product wL is the roll-work contact area, mm2 (in2).

The process is accomplished by passing the work through rolls that have the reverse of the desired shape. \rMost of the principles that apply in \ufb02at rolling are also applicable to shape rolling. Shaping rolls are more complicated; and the work, usually starting as a square shape, requires a gradual transformation through several rolls in order to achieve the \ufb01nal cross section.Designing the sequence of intermediate shapes and corresponding rolls is called roll-pass design. Its goal is to achieve uniform deformation throughout the cross section in each reduction. Otherwise, certain portions of the work are reduced more than others, causing greater elongation in these sections. The consequence of nonuniform reduction can be warping and cracking of the rolled product. Both horizontal and vertical rolls are utilized to achieve consistent reduction of the work material. \r\r18.1.3 ROLLING MILLS \rVarious rolling mill con\ufb01gurations are available to deal with the variety of applications and technical problems in the rolling process. The basic rolling mill consists of two opposing rolls and is referred to as a two-high rolling mill, shown in Figure 18.5(a). The rolls in these mills have diameters in the range 0.6 to 1.4 m (2.0\u20134.5 ft). The two-high con\ufb01guration can be either reversing or nonreversing. In the nonreversing mill, the rolls always rotate in the same direction, and the work always passes through from the same side. The reversing mill allows the direction of roll rotation to be reversed, so that the work can be passed through in either direction. This permits a series of reductions to be made through the same set of rolls, simply by passing through the work from opposite directions multiple times. The disadvantage of the reversing con\ufb01guration is the signi\ufb01cant angular momentum possessed by large rotating rolls and the associated technical problems involved in reversing the direction. \r\rSeveral alternative arrangements are illustrated in Figure 18.5. In the three-high con\ufb01guration, Figure 18.5(b), there are three rolls in a vertical column, and the direction of rotation of each roll remains unchanged.To achieve a series of reductions,the work can be passed through from either side by raising or lowering the strip after each pass. The equipment in a three-high rolling mill becomes more complicated, because an elevator mechanism is needed to raise and lower the work. \rAs several of the previous equations indicate, advantages are gained in reducing roll diameter. Roll-work contact length is reduced with a lower roll radius, and this leads to lower forces, torque, and power. The four-high rolling mill uses two smaller-diameter rolls to contact the work and two backing rolls behind them, as in Figure 18.5(c). Owing to the high roll forces, these smaller rolls would de\ufb02 ect elastically between their end bearings as the work passes through unless the larger backing rolls were used to support them. Another roll con\ufb01 guration that allows smaller working rolls against the work is the cluster rolling mill, shown in Figure 18.5(d). \rTo achieve higher throughput rates in standard products, a tandem rolling mill is often used. This con\ufb01guration consists of a series of rolling stands, as represented in Figure 18.5(e).Although only three stands are shown in the sketch, a typical tandem rolling mill may have eight or ten stands, each making a reduction in thickness or a re\ufb01nement in shape of the work passing through. With each rolling step, work velocity increases, and the problem of synchronizing the roll speeds at each stand is a signi\ufb01 cant one. \r\rModern tandem rolling mills are often supplied directly by continuous casting operations (Section 6.2.2).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 15533, "end_char_idx": 19945, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1f5f61f-2628-4dca-8041-2768970a4163": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1f5f61f-2628-4dca-8041-2768970a4163", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec18.txt", "file_name": "sec18.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 93042, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a0a271ae-5c39-445c-afcc-5c66648375ea", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec18.txt", "file_name": "sec18.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 93042, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "f8f80264700db35b05450f866bdec046a03cb8198dea72b9fae5a6e0ab0afa27", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bde1e568-88cd-4768-935c-09690c929034", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec18.txt", "file_name": "sec18.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 93042, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "bbb33392b41c8e43cc0eab60a32f22a2a475bf41a6a3be599872ee03940f2b08", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4b049bf9-dfa3-4711-ab22-fa691888648b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8f144163c2e6f7238f055ca8077c850b1e0ad2ea5b543ad41afec5ea7527de3d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Another roll con\ufb01 guration that allows smaller working rolls against the work is the cluster rolling mill, shown in Figure 18.5(d). \rTo achieve higher throughput rates in standard products, a tandem rolling mill is often used.

These setups achieve a high degree of integration among the processes required to transform starting raw materials into \ufb01 nished products. Advantages include elimination of soaking pits, reduction in \ufb02 oor space, and shorter manufacturing lead times.These technical advantages translate into economic bene\ufb01 ts for a mill that can accomplish continuous casting and rolling. \r\r\r\r\rOther Deformation Processes Related to Rolling \rSeveral other bulk deformation processes use rolls to form the work part.The operations include thread rolling, ring rolling, gear rolling, and roll piercing. \rThread Rolling Thread rolling is used to form threads on cylindrical parts by rolling them between two dies. It is the most important commercial process for mass producing external threaded components (e.g., bolts and screws). The competing process is thread cutting (Section 21.7.1). Most thread rolling operations are performed by cold working in thread rolling machines. These machines are equipped with special dies that determine the size and form of the thread. The dies are of two types: (1) \ufb02at dies, which reciprocate relative to each other, as illustrated in Figure 18.6; and (2) round dies, which rotate relative to each other to accomplish the rolling action. \rProduction rates in thread rolling can be high, ranging up to eight parts per second for small bolts and screws. Not only are these rates signi\ufb01cantly higher than thread cutting, but there are other advantages over machining as well: (1) better material utilization, (2) stronger threads due to work hardening, (3) smoother surface, and (4) better fatigue resistance due to compressive stresses introduced by rolling. \rRing Rolling Ring rolling is a deformation process in which a thick-walled ring of smaller diameter is rolled into a thin-walled ring of larger diameter. The before and after views of the process are illustrated in Figure 18.7. As the thick-walled ring is compressed, the deformed material elongates, causing the diameter of the ring to be enlarged. Ring rolling is usually performed as a hot-working process for large rings and as a cold-working process for smaller rings. \r\r\r(2) completion of process. \rApplications of ring rolling include ball and roller bearing races, steel tires for railroad wheels, and rings for pipes, pressure vessels, and rotating machinery. The ring walls are not limited to rectangular cross sections; the process permits rolling of more complex shapes. There are several advantages of ring rolling over alternative methods of making the same parts: raw material savings, ideal grain orientation for the application, and strengthening through cold working. \rGear Rolling Gear rolling is a cold working process to produce certain gears. The automotive industry is an important user of these products. The setup in gear rolling is similar to thread rolling, except that the deformed features of the cylindrical blank or disk are oriented parallel to its axis (or at an angle in the case of helical gears) rather than spiraled as in thread rolling. Alternative production methods for gears include several machining operations, discussed in Section 21.7.2. Advantages of gear rolling compared to machining are similar to those of thread rolling: higher production rates, better strength and fatigue resistance, and less material waste. \rRoll Piercing Roll piercing is a specialized hot working process for making seamless thick-walled tubes. It utilizes two opposing rolls, and hence it is grouped with the rolling processes.

Advantages of gear rolling compared to machining are similar to those of thread rolling: higher production rates, better strength and fatigue resistance, and less material waste. \rRoll Piercing Roll piercing is a specialized hot working process for making seamless thick-walled tubes. It utilizes two opposing rolls, and hence it is grouped with the rolling processes. The process is based on the principle that when a solid cylindrical part is compressed on its circumference, as in Figure 18.8(a), high tensile stresses are developed at its center.

A mandrel is used to control the size and \ufb01 nish of the hole created by the action.The terms rotary tube piercing and Mannesmann process are also used for this tube-making operation. \r\r\r Forging \rForging is a deformation process in which the work is compressed between two dies, using either impact or gradual pressure to form the part. It is the oldest of the metal forming operations, dating back to perhaps 5000 B.C.E. (Historical Note 18.2). Today, forging is an important industrial process used to make a variety of high-strength components for automotive, aerospace, and other applications. These components include engine crankshafts and connecting rods, gears, aircraft structural components, and jet engine turbine parts. In addition, steel and other basic metals industries use forging to establish the basic form of large components that are subsequently machined to \ufb01nal shape and dimensions. \rHistorical Note 18.2 Forging \rThe forging process dates from the earliest written Crete around 1600 B.C.E. This evolved into the fabricarecords of man, around 7000 years ago. There is evi-tion of coins by a similar process around 800 B.C.E. dence that forging was used in ancient Egypt, Greece, More complicated impression dies were used in Persia, India, China, and Japan to make weapons, jew-Rome around 200 C.E. The blacksmith\u2019s trade remained elry, and a variety of implements. Craftsmen in the art relatively unchanged for many centuries until the drop of forging during these times were held in high regard. hammer with guided ram was introduced near the end \rEngraved stone platens were used as impression of the eighteenth century. This development brought dies in the hammering of gold and silver in ancient forging practice into the Industrial Age. \r\rForging is carried out in many different ways. One way to classify the operations is by working temperature. Most forging operations are performed hot or warm, owing to the signi\ufb01cant deformation demanded by the process and the need to reduce strength and increase ductility of the work metal. However, cold forging is also very common for certain products.The advantage of cold forging is the increased strength that results from strain hardening of the component. \rEither impact or gradual pressure is used in forging. The distinction derives more from the type of equipment used than differences in process technology. A forging machine that applies an impact load is called a forging hammer, while one that applies gradual pressure is called a forging press. \rAnother difference among forging operations is the degree to which the \ufb02ow of the work metal is constrained by the dies. By this classi\ufb01cation, there are three types of forging operations, shown in Figure 18.9: (a) open-die forging, (b) impression-die forging, and (c) \ufb02ashless forging. In open-die forging, the work is compressed between two \ufb02at (or almost \ufb02at) dies, thus allowing the metal to \ufb02ow without constraint in a lateral direction relative to the die surfaces. In impression-die forging, the die surfaces contain a shape or impression that is imparted to the work during compression, thus constraining metal \ufb02ow to a signi\ufb01cant degree.

The volume of the starting workpiece must be controlled very closely so that it matches the volume of the die cavity. \r\r18.3.1 OPEN-DIE FORGING \rThe simplest case of open-die forging involves compression of a work part of cylindrical cross section between two \ufb02at dies, much in the manner of a compression test (Section 3.1.2). This forging operation, known as upsetting or upset forging, reduces the height of the work and increases its diameter. \rAnalysis of Open-Die Forging If open-die forging is carried out under ideal conditions of no friction between work and die surfaces, then homogeneous deformation occurs, and the radial \ufb02ow of the material is uniform throughout its height, as pictured in Figure 18.10. Under these ideal conditions, the true strain experienced by the work during the process can be determined by \rho \re  ln (18.14)\rh \rwhere ho \" starting height of the work, mm (in); and h \" the height at some intermediate point in the process, mm (in). At the end of the compression stroke, h  its \ufb01nal value hf, and the true strain reaches its maximum value. \r\rFIGURE 18.10 \rHomogeneousdeformation of a cylindrical work partunder ideal conditions in an open-die forgingoperation: (1) start ofprocess with workpieceat its original lengthand diameter, (2) partial compression, and\r(3) \ufb01 nal size. \rFIGURE 18.11 Actual deformation of a cylindrical work part in open-die forging, showing pronounced barreling: (1) start of process, (2) partial deformation, and \r(3) \ufb01 nal shape. \r\rEstimates of force to perform upsetting can be calculated. The force required to continue the compression at any given height h during the process can be obtained by multiplying the corresponding cross-sectional area by the \ufb02ow stress: \rF \" Yf A (18.15) \r\rwhere F  force, lb (N); A  cross-sectional area of the part, mm2 (in2); and Yf  \ufb02 ow stress corresponding to the strain given by Equation (18.14), MPa (lb/in2). Area A continuously increases during the operation as height is reduced. Flow stress Yf also increases as a result of work hardening, except when the metal is perfectly plastic (e.g., in hot working). In this case, the strain hardening exponent n  0, and \ufb02 ow stress Yf equals the metal\u2019s yield strength Y. Force reaches a maximum value at the end of the forging stroke, when both area and \ufb02ow stress are at their highest values. \rAn actual upsetting operation does not occur quite as shown in Figure 18.10 because friction opposes the \ufb02ow of work metal at the die surfaces.

An example of open-die forging in the steel industry is the shaping of a large square cast ingot into a round cross section. Open-die forging operations produce rough forms, and subsequent operations are required to re\ufb01ne the parts to \ufb01nal geometry and dimensions. An important contribution of open-die hot-forging is that it creates a favorable grain \ufb02 ow and metallurgical structure in the metal. \r1500 \r1000 \r500 \r\r0 FIGURE 18.12 Upsetting force as a 756249 36 h (mm)function of height h and height reduction (ho # h).

Fullering is a forging operation performed to reduce the cross section and redistribute the metal in a work part in preparation for subsequent shape forging. It is accomplished by dies with convex surfaces. Fullering die cavities are often designed into multi-cavity impression dies, so that the starting bar can be rough formed before \ufb01nal shaping. Edging is similar to fullering, except that the dies have concave surfaces. \rA cogging operation consists of a sequence of forging compressions along the length of a workpiece to reduce cross section and increase length. It is used in the steel industry to produce blooms and slabs from cast ingots. It is accomplished using open dies with \ufb02at or slightly contoured surfaces. The term incremental forging is sometimes used for this process. \r\r\r18.3.2 IMPRESSION-DIE FORGING \rImpression-die forging, sometimes called closed-die forging, is performed with dies that contain the inverse of the desired shape of the part. The process is illustrated in a three-step sequence in Figure 18.14. The raw workpiece is shown as a cylindrical part similar to that used in the previous open-die operation. As the die closes to its \ufb01nal position, \ufb02ash is formed by metal that \ufb02ows beyond the die cavity and into the small gap between the die plates. Although this \ufb02ash must be cut away from the part in a subsequent trimming operation, it actually serves an important function during impression-die forging. As the \ufb02ash begins to form in the die gap, friction resists continued \ufb02ow of metal into the gap, thus constraining the bulk of the work material to remain in the die cavity. In hot forging, metal \ufb02 ow is further restricted because the thin \ufb02 ash cools quickly against the die plates, thereby increasing its resistance to deformation. Restricting metal \ufb02ow in the gap causes the compression pressures on the part to increase signi\ufb01 cantly, thus forcing the material to \ufb01ll the sometimes intricate details of the die cavity to ensure a high-quality product. \r\r\rSeveral forming steps are often required in impression die forging to transform the starting blank into the desired \ufb01nal geometry. Separate cavities in the die are needed for each step.

In other cases, selecting the proper value of \ufb02ow stress is dif\ufb01cult because the strain varies throughout the workpiece for complex shapes. Kf in Equation (18.18) is a factor intended to account for increases in force required to forge part shapes of various complexities. Table 18.1 indicates the range of values of Kf for different part geometries. Obviously, the problem of specifying the proper Kf value for a given work part limits the accuracy of the force estimate. \rEquation (18.18) applies to the maximum force during the operation, since this is the load that will determine the required capacity of the press or hammer used in the operation. The maximum force is reached at the end of the forging stroke, when the projected area is greatest and friction is maximum. \rImpression-die forging is not capable of close tolerance work, and machining is often required to achieve the accuracies needed. The basic geometry of the part is obtained from the forging process, with machining performed on those portions of the part that require precision \ufb01nishing (e.g., holes, threads, and surfaces that mate with other components). The advantages of forging, compared to machining the part completely, are higher production rates, conservation of metal, greater strength, and favorable grain orientation of the metal that results from forging. A comparison of the grain \ufb02ow in forging and machining is illustrated in Figure 18.15. \rImprovements in the technology of impression-die forging have resulted in the capability to produce forgings with thinner sections, more complex geometries, drastic reductions in draft requirements on the dies, closer tolerances, and the virtual elimination of machining allowances.

Depending on whether machining is required to \ufb01nish the part geometry, precision forgings are properly classi\ufb01 ed as near net shape or net shape processes. \r\r18.3.3 FLASHLESS FORGING \rAs mentioned above, impression-die forging is sometimes called closed-die forging in industry terminology. However, there is a technical distinction between impression-die forging and true closed-die forging. The distinction is that in closed-die forging, the raw workpiece is completely contained within the die cavity during compression, and no \ufb02ash is formed. The process sequence is illustrated in Figure 18.17. The term \ufb02 ashless forging is appropriate to identify this process. \rFlashless forging imposes requirements on process control that are more demanding than impression-die forging. Most important is that the work volume must equal \rFIGURE 18.17 \rFlashless forging: \r(1) \rjust before initial contact with workpiece, \r\r(2) \rpartial compression, and (3) \ufb01nal punch and die closure. Symbols v and F indicate motion (v = velocity) and applied force,respectively. \r\r\r\r\rthe space in the die cavity within a very close tolerance. If the starting blank is too large, excessive pressures may cause damage to the die or press. If the blank is too small, the cavity will not be \ufb01lled. Because of the special demands made by \ufb02ashless forging, the process lends itself best to part geometries that are usually simple and symmetrical, and to work materials such as aluminum and magnesium and their alloys. Flashless forging is often classi\ufb01ed as a precision forging process [5]. \rForces in \ufb02ashless forging reach values comparable to those in impression die \rforging. Estimates of these forces can be computed using the same methods as for \rimpression die forging: Equation (18.18) and Table 18.1. \rCoining is a special application of closed-die forging in which \ufb01ne details in the die are impressed into the top and bottom surfaces of the work part. There is little \ufb02ow of metal in coining, yet the pressures required to reproduce the surface details in the die cavity are high, as indicated by the value of Kf in Table 18.1. A common application of coining is, of course, in the minting of coins, shown in Figure 18.18. The process is also used to provide good surface \ufb01nish and dimensional accuracy on work parts made by other operations. \r\r\r18.3.4 FORGING HAMMERS, PRESSES, AND DIES \rEquipment used in forging consists of forging machines, classi\ufb01ed as hammers or presses, and forging dies, which are the special tooling used in these machines. In addition, auxiliary equipment is needed, such as furnaces to heat the work, mechanical devices to load and unload the work, and trimming stations to cut away the \ufb02ash in impression-die forging. \rForging Hammers Forging hammers operate by applying an impact loading against the work.The term drop hammer is often used for these machines, owing to the means \r\r\rFIGURE 18.19 Dropforging hammer, fed by conveyor and heatingunits at the right of thescene.

(Photo courtesyof Ajax-Ceco.) \rof delivering the impact energy; see Figures 18.19 and 18.20. Drop hammers are most frequently used for impression-die forging. The upper portion of the forging die is attached to the ram, and the lower portion is attached to the anvil. In the operation, the work is placed on the lower die,and the ram is lifted and then dropped.When the upper die strikes the work, the impact energy causes the part to assume the form of the die cavity. Several blows of the hammer are often required to achieve the desired change in shape. Drop hammers can be classi\ufb01ed as gravity drop hammers and power drop hammers. Gravity drop hammers achieve their energy by the falling weight of \r\rHead (containingcylinder) \rPiston rod Frame Ram \rAnvil \r\rFIGURE 18.20 Diagram showing details ofa drop hammer for impression-die forging. \ra heavy ram. The force of the blow is determined by the height of the drop and the weight of the ram. Power drop hammers accelerate the ram by pressurized air or steam. One of the disadvantages of drop hammers is that a large amount of the impact energy is transmitted through the anvil and into the \ufb02oor of the building. \rForging Presses Presses apply gradual pressure, rather than sudden impact, to accomplish the forging operation. Forging presses include mechanical presses, hydraulic presses, and screw presses. Mechanical presses operate by means of eccentrics, cranks, or knuckle joints, which convert the rotating motion of a drive motor into the translation motion of the ram. These mechanisms are very similar to those used in stamping presses (Section 19.5.2). Mechanical presses typically achieve very high forces at the bottom of the forging stroke. Hydraulic presses use a hydraulically driven piston to actuate the ram. Screw presses apply force by a screw mechanism that drives the vertical ram. Both screw drive and hydraulic drive operate at relatively low ram speeds and can provide a constant force throughout the stroke. These machines are therefore suitable for forging (and other forming) operations that require a long stroke. \rForging Dies Proper die design is important in the success of a forging operation. Parts to be forged must be designed based on knowledge of the principles and limitations of this process. The purpose here is to describe some of the terminology and guidelines used in the design of forgings and forging dies. Design of open dies is generally straightforward because the dies are relatively simple in shape.The following comments apply to impression dies and closed dies. Figure 18.21 de\ufb01nes some of the terminology in an impression die. \rSome of the principles and limitations that must be considered in the part design or in the selection of forging as the manufacturing process is provided in the following discussion of forging die terminology [5]: \r\u27a2 \rParting line. The parting line is the plane that divides the upper die from the lower die. Called the \ufb02ash line in impression-die forging, it is the plane where the two die halves meet. Its selection by the designer affects grain \ufb02ow in the part, required load, and \ufb02 ash formation. \r\r\u27a2 \rDraft. Draft is the amount of taper on the sides of the part required to remove it from the die. The term also applies to the taper on the sides of the die cavity. Typical draft angles are 3\u00b0 on aluminum and magnesium parts and 5\u00b0 to 7\u00b0 on steel parts. Draft angles on precision forgings are near zero. \r\r\u27a2 \rWebs and ribs. A web is a thin portion of the forging that is parallel to the parting line, while a rib is a thin portion that is perpendicular to the parting line. These part features cause dif\ufb01culty in metal \ufb02ow as they become thinner. \r\r\u27a2 \rFillet and corner radii.

Flash formation plays a critical role in impression-die forging by causing pressure buildup inside the die to promote \ufb01lling of the cavity. This pressure buildup is controlled by designing a \ufb02ash land and gutter into the die, as pictured in Figure 18.21. The land determines the surface area along which lateral \ufb02ow of metal occurs, thereby controlling the pressure increase inside the die. The gutter permits excess metal to escape without causing the forging load to reach extreme values. \r\r\r\rFIGURE 18.21 \rTerminology for a conventional impression-die in forging. \r\r\r\r\r\r\rOther Deformation Processes Related to Forging \rIn addition to the conventional forging operations discussed in the preceding sections, other metal forming operations are closely associated with forging. \rUpsetting and Heading Upsetting (also called upset forging) is a deformation opera tion in which a cylindrical work part is increased in diameter and reduced in length.This operation is analyzed in the discussion of open-die forging (Section 18.3.1). However, as an industrial operation, it can also be performed as closed-die forging, as in Figure 18.22. \r\r(1) Wire stock is fed to the stop; (2) gripping dies close on the stock and the stop is retracted; (3) punch moves forward;and (4) bottoms to form the head. \r\rUpsetting is widely used in the fastener industry to form heads on nails, bolts, and similar hardware products. In these applications, the term heading is often used to denote the operation. Figure 18.23 illustrates a variety of heading applications, indicating various possible die con\ufb01gurations. Owing to these types of applications, more parts are produced by upsetting than by any other forging operation. It is performed as a mass-production operation\u2014cold, warm, or hot\u2014on special upset forging machines, called headers or formers. These machines are usually equipped with horizontal slides, rather than vertical slides as in conventional forging hammers and presses. Long wire or bar stock is fed into the machines, the end of the stock is upset forged, and then the piece is cut to length to make the desired hardware item. For bolts and screws, thread rolling (Section 18.2) is used to form the threads. \rThere are limits on the amount of deformation that can be achieved in upsetting, usuallyde\ufb01nedasthemaximum lengthofstocktobeforged.Themaximumlengththat can be upset in one blow is three times the diameter of the starting stock. Otherwise, the metal bends or buckles instead of compressing properly to \ufb01ll the cavity. \rSwaging and Radial Forging Swaging and radial forging are forging processes used to reduce the diameter of a tube or solid rod. Swaging is often performed on the end of a workpiece to create a tapered section.

Figure 18.25 illustrates some of the shapes and products that are made by swaging. A mandrel is sometimes required to control the shape and size of the internal diameter of tubular parts that are swaged. Radial forging is similar to swaging in its action against the work and is used to create similar part shapes. The difference is that in radial forging the dies do not rotate around the workpiece; instead the work is rotated as it feeds into the hammering dies. \rRoll Forging Roll forging is a deformation process used to reduce the cross section of a cylindrical (or rectangular) workpiece by passing it through a set of opposing rolls that have grooves matching the desired shape of the \ufb01nal part.The typical operation is illustrated in Figure 18.26. Roll forging is generally classi\ufb01ed as a forging process even though it utilizes rolls. The rolls do not turn continuously in roll forging, but rotate through only a portion of one revolution corresponding to the desired deformation to be accomplished on the part. Roll-forged parts are generally stronger and possess favorable grain structure compared to competing processes such as machining that might be used to produce the same part geometry. \r\r\rOrbital Forging In this process, deformation occurs by means of a cone-shaped upper die that is simultaneously rolled and pressed into the work part.As illustrated in Figure 18.27, the work is supported on a lower die, which has a cavity into which the work is compressed. Because the axis of the cone is inclined, only a small area of the work surface is compressed at any moment. As the upper die revolves, the area under compression also revolves. These operating characteristics of orbital forging result in a substantial reduction in press load required to accomplish deformation of the work. \rHubbing Hubbing is a deformation process in which a hardened steel form is pressed into a soft steel (or other soft metal) block. The process is often used to make mold cavities for plastic molding and die casting, as sketched in Figure 18.28. The hardened steel form, called the hub, is machined to the geometry of the part to be molded. Substantial pressures are required to force the hub into the soft block, and this is usually accomplished by a hydraulic press. Complete formation of the die cavity in the block often requires several steps\u2014hubbing followed by annealing to recover the work metal from strain hardening.When signi\ufb01cant amounts of material are deformed in the block, as shown in the \ufb01gure, the excess must be machined away. The advantage of hubbing in this application is that it is generally easier to machine the positive form than the mating negative cavity. This advantage is multiplied in cases where more than one cavity are made in the die block. \rIsothermal Forging Isothermal forging is a term applied to a hot-forging operation in which the work part is maintained at or near its starting elevated temperature during deformation, usually by heating the forging dies to the same elevated temperature. By avoiding chill of the workpiece on contact with the cold die surfaces as in conventional forging, the metal \ufb02ows more readily and the force required to perform the process is reduced. Isothermal forging is more expensive than conventional forging and is usually reserved for dif\ufb01cult-to-forge metals, such as titanium and \r\r\rFIGURE 18.28 \rHubbing: (1) before deformation, and \r(2) as the process is completed.

The process is sometimes carried out in a vacuum to avoid rapid oxidation of the die material. Similar to isothermal forging is hot-die forging, in which the dies are heated to a temperature that is somewhat below that of the work metal. \rTrimming Trimming is an operation used to remove \ufb02ash on the work part in impression-die forging. In most cases, trimming is accomplished by shearing, as in Figure 18.29, in which a punch forces the work through a cutting die, the blades for which have the pro\ufb01le of the desired part. Trimming is usually done while the work is still hot, which means that a separate trimming press is included at each forging hammer or press. In cases where the work might be damaged by the cutting process, trimming may be done by alternative methods, such as grinding or sawing. \r\r\rExtrusion \rExtrusion is a compression process in which the work metal is forced to \ufb02ow through a die opening to produce a desired cross-sectional shape.The process can be likened to squeezing toothpaste out of a toothpaste tube. Extrusion dates from around 1800 (Historical Note 18.3). There are several advantages of the modern process: (1) a variety of shapes are possible, especially with hot extrusion; (2) grain structure and strength properties are enhanced in cold and warm extrusion; (3) fairly close tolerances are possible, especially in cold extrusion; and (4) in some extrusion operations, little or no wasted material is created. However, a limitation is that the cross section of the extruded part must be uniform throughout its length. \r\rHistorical Note 18.3 Extrusion \rExtrusion as an industrial process was invented around 1800 in England, during the Industrial Revolution when that country was leading the world in technological innovations. The invention consisted of the \ufb01 rst hydraulic press for extruding lead pipes. An important step \r18.5.1 TYPES OF EXTRUSION \rforward was made in Germany around 1890, when the \ufb01 rst horizontal extrusion press was built for extruding metals with higher melting points than lead. The feature that made this possible was the use of a dummy block that separated the ram from the work billet. \rExtrusion is carried out in various ways. One important distinction is between direct extrusion and indirect extrusion. Another classi\ufb01cation is by working temperature: cold, warm, or hot extrusion. Finally, extrusion is performed as either a continuous process or a discrete process. \rDirect versus Indirect Extrusion Direct extrusion (also called forward extrusion) is illustrated in Figure 18.30. A metal billet is loaded into a container, and a ram compresses the material, forcing it to \ufb02ow through one or more openings in a die at the opposite end of the container. As the ram approaches the die, a small portion of the billet remains that cannot be forced through the die opening. This extra portion, called the butt, is separated from the product by cutting it just beyond the exit of the die. \r\r\r\rFIGURE 18.31 \r(a)\r Direct extrusion to produce a hollowor semi-hollow cross section; (b) hollow and\r\r(c)\r semi-hollow cross sections. \r\r\rOne of the problems in direct extrusion is the signi\ufb01cant friction that exists between the work surface and the walls of the container as the billet is forced to slide toward the die opening.

This friction causes a substantial increase in the ram force required in direct extrusion. In hot extrusion, the friction problem is aggravated by the presence of an oxide layer on the surface of the billet. This oxide layer can cause defects in the extruded product. To address these problems, a dummy block is often used between the ram and the work billet. The diameter of the dummy block is slightly smaller than the billet diameter, so that a narrow ring of work metal (mostly the oxide layer) is left in the container, leaving the \ufb01 nal product free of oxides. \rHollow sections (e.g., tubes) are possible in direct extrusion by the process setup in Figure 18.31. The starting billet is prepared with a hole parallel to its axis. This allows passage of a mandrel that is attached to the dummy block.As the billet is compressed, the material is forced to \ufb02ow through the clearance between the mandrel and the die opening.The resulting cross section is tubular.Semi-hollow cross-sectional shapes are usually extruded in the same way. \rThe starting billet in direct extrusion is usually round in cross section, but the \ufb01 nal shape is determined by the shape of the die opening. Obviously, the largest dimension of the die opening must be smaller than the diameter of the billet. \rIn indirect extrusion, also called backward extrusion and reverse extrusion, Figure 18.32(a), the die is mounted to the ram rather than at the opposite end of the container. As the ram penetrates into the work, the metal is forced to \ufb02ow through the clearance in a direction opposite to the motion of the ram. Since the billet is not forced to move relative to the container, there is no friction at the container walls, and the ram force is therefore lower than in direct extrusion. Limitations of indirect extrusion are imposed by the lower rigidity of the hollow ram and the dif\ufb01culty in supporting the extruded product as it exits the die. \rIndirect extrusion can produce hollow (tubular) cross sections, as in Figure 18.32(b). In this method,the ram is pressed into the billet,forcing the material to \ufb02ow around the \r\rshape shape \r(a) (b) \r\rFIGURE 18.32 Indirect extrusion to produce (a) a solid cross section and (b) a hollow cross section. \rram and take a cup shape.There are practical limitations on the length of the extruded part that can be made by this method. Support of the ram becomes a problem as work length increases. \rHot versus Cold Extrusion Extrusion can be performed either hot or cold, depending on work metal and amount of strain to which it is subjected during deformation. Metals that are typically extruded hot include aluminum, copper, magnesium, zinc, tin, and their alloys. These same metals are sometimes extruded cold. Steel alloys are usually extruded hot, although the softer, more ductile grades are sometimes cold extruded (e.g., low carbon steels and stainless steel). Aluminum is probably the most ideal metal for extrusion (hot and cold), and many commercial aluminum products are made by this process (structural shapes, door and window frames, etc.). \rHot extrusion involves prior heating of the billet to a temperature above its recrystallization temperature.This reduces strength and increases ductility of the metal,permitting more extreme size reductions and more complex shapes to be achieved in the process. Additional advantages include reduction of ram force, increased ram speed, and reduction of grain \ufb02ow characteristics in the \ufb01nal product.

Glass is sometimes used as a lubricant in hot extrusion; in addition to reducing friction, it also provides effective thermal insulation between the billet and the extrusion container. \rCold extrusion and warm extrusion are generally used to produce discrete parts, often in \ufb01nished (or near \ufb01nished) form. The term impact extrusion is used to indicate high-speed cold extrusion, and this method is described in Section 18.5.4. Some important advantages of cold extrusion include increased strength due to strain hardening, close tolerances, improved surface \ufb01nish, absence of oxide layers, and high production rates. Cold extrusion at room temperature also eliminates the need for heating the starting billet. \rContinuous versus Discrete Processing A true continuous process operates in steady state mode for an inde\ufb01nite period of time. Some extrusion operations approach this ideal by producing very long sections in one cycle, but these operations are ultimately limited by the size of the starting billet that can be loaded into the extrusion container. These processes are more accurately described as semi-continuous operations. In nearly all cases, the long section is cut into smaller lengths in a subsequent sawing or shearing operation. \r\rIn a discrete extrusion operation, a single part is produced in each extrusion cycle. Impact extrusion is an example of the discrete processing case. \r\r18.5.2 ANALYSIS OF EXTRUSION \rReference Figure 18.33 as some of the parameters in extrusion are discussed. The diagram assumes that both billet and extrudate are round in cross section. One impor tant parameter is the extrusion ratio, also called the reduction ratio.The ratio is de\ufb01ned: \rAo\rrx \" (18.19)\rAf \r\rwhere rx  extrusion ratio; Ao  cross-sectional area of the starting billet, mm2 (in2); and Af  \ufb01 nal cross-sectional area of the extruded section, mm2 (in2). The ratio applies for both direct and indirect extrusion.The value of rx can be used to determine true strain in extrusion, given that ideal deformation occurs with no friction and no redundant work: \rAo \re  ln rx  ln (18.20)\rAf \r\rUnder the assumption of ideal deformation (no friction and no redundant work), the pressure applied by the ram to compress the billet through the die opening depicted in the \ufb01gure can be computed as follows: \rp \" Yf ln rx (18.21) \r\rwhere Yf \" average \ufb02ow stress during deformation, MPa (lb/in2). For convenience, Equation (17.2) is restated from the previous chapter: \rKen \r\rYf \" \r1 $ n \r\rIn fact, extrusion is not a frictionless process, and the previous equations grossly underestimate the strain and pressure in an extrusion operation. Friction exists between the die and the work as the billet squeezes down and passes through the die opening.

Mechanical drives are often used for cold extrusion of individual parts, such as in impact extrusion. \r\r\r18.5.4 OTHER EXTRUSION PROCESSES \rDirect and indirect extrusion are the principal methods of extrusion. Various names are given to operations that are special cases of the direct and indirect methods described here. Other extrusion operations are unique. This section examines some of these special forms of extrusion and related processes. \rImpact Extrusion Impact extrusion is performed at higher speeds and shorter strokes than conventional extrusion. It is used to make individual components. As the name suggests, the punch impacts the work part rather than simply applying pressure to it. Impacting can be carried out as forward extrusion, backward extrusion, or combinations of these. Some representative examples are shown in Figure 18.37. \rImpact extrusion is usually done cold on a variety of metals. Backward impact extrusion is most common. Products made by this process include toothpaste tubes and battery cases. As indicated by these examples, very thin walls are possible on impact extruded parts. The high speed characteristics of impacting permit large reductions and high production rates, making this an important commercial process. \r\r\rHydrostatic Extrusion One of the problems in direct extrusion is friction along the billet\u2013container interface. This problem can be addressed by surrounding the billet with \ufb02 uid inside the container and pressurizing the \ufb02 uid by the forward motion of the ram,as in Figure 18.38.This way,there is no friction inside the container,and friction at the die opening is reduced. Consequently, ram force is signi\ufb01 cantly lower than in \r\rFIGURE 18.38 \rHydrostatic extrusion. \rdirect extrusion. The \ufb02uid pressure acting on all surfaces of the billet gives the process its name. It can be carried out at room temperature or at elevated temperatures. Special \ufb02uids and procedures must be used at elevated temperatures. Hydrostatic extrusion is an adaptation of direct extrusion. \rHydrostatic pressure on the work increases the material\u2019s ductility. Accordingly, this process can be used on metals that would be too brittle for conventional extrusion operations. Ductile metals can also be hydrostatically extruded, and high reduction ratios are possible on these materials. One of the disadvantages of the process is the required preparation of the starting work billet. The billet must be formed with a taper at one end to \ufb01t snugly into the die entry angle.This establishes a seal to prevent \ufb02uid from squirting out the die hole when the container is initially pressurized. \r\r\r18.5.5 DEFECTS IN EXTRUDED PRODUCTS \rOwing to the considerable deformation associated with extrusion operations, a number of defects can occur in extruded products. The defects can be classi\ufb01ed into the following categories, illustrated in Figure 18.39: \r(a) \rCenterburst. This defect is an internal crack that develops as a result of tensile stresses along the centerline of the work part during extrusion.Although tensile stresses may seem unlikely in a compression process such as extrusion, they tend to occur under conditions that cause large deformation in the regions of the work away from the central axis.The signi\ufb01cant material movement in these outer regions stretches the material along the center of the work. If stresses are great enough, bursting occurs.

The general features of the process are similar to those of extrusion. The difference is that the work is pulled through the die in drawing, whereas it is pushed through the die in extrusion. Although the presence of tensile stresses is obvious in drawing, compression also plays a signi\ufb01cant role because the metal is squeezed down as it passes through the die opening. For this reason, the deformation that occurs in drawing is sometimes referred to as indirect compression. Drawing is a term also used in sheet metalworking (Section 19.3).The term wire and bar drawing is used to distinguish the drawing process discussed here from the sheet metal process of the same name. \rThe basic difference between bar drawing and wire drawing is the stock size that \ris processed. Bar drawing is the term used for large diameter bar and rod stock, \rwhile wire drawing applies to small diameter stock. Wire sizes down to 0.03 mm \r(0.001 in) are possible in wire drawing. Although the mechanics of the process are the same for the two cases, the methods, equipment, and even the terminology are somewhat different. \rBar drawing is generally accomplished as a single-draft operation\u2014the stock is pulled through one die opening. Because the beginning stock has a large diameter, it is in the form of a straight cylindrical piece rather than coiled. This limits the length of the work that can be drawn, necessitating a batch type operation. By contrast, wire is drawn from coils consisting of several hundred (or even several thousand) feet of wire and is passed through a series of draw dies. The number of dies varies typically between 4 and 12. The term continuous drawing is used to describe this type of operation because of the long production runs that are achieved with the wire coils, which can be butt-welded each to the next to make the operation truly continuous. \rIn a drawing operation, the change in size of the work is usually given by the area reduction, de\ufb01ned as follows: \rAo # Af \rr \" (18.28)\rAo \r\rwhere r  area reduction in drawing; Ao  original area of work, mm2 (in2); and Af \" \r\ufb01 nal area, mm2 (in2).

How are stresses and forces computed in the process? How large a reduction is possible in a drawing operation? \rMechanics of Drawing If no friction or redundant work occurred in drawing, true strain could be determined as follows: \rAo 1 \re  ln  ln (18.30)\rAf 1 # r \rwhere Ao and Af are the original and \ufb01nal cross-sectional areas of the work, as previously de\ufb01ned; and r \" drawing reduction as given by Equation (18.28). The stress that results from this ideal deformation is given by \rAo \rs \" Yf e \" Yf ln (18.31)\rAf K en \rwhere Yf \" average \ufb02ow stress based on the value of strain given by Equation \r1 $ n(18.30). \rBecause friction is present in drawing and the work metal experiences inhomogeneous deformation, the actual stress is larger than provided by Equation (18.31). In addition to the ratio Ao/Af, other variables that in\ufb02uence draw stress are die angle and coef\ufb01cient of friction at the work-die interface.A number of methods have been proposed for predicting draw stress based on values of these parameters [1], [3], and [19]. The equation suggested by Schey [19] is the following: \r__ m \r_____ Ao \rsd \" Yf (1 $ ) \u00f8 ln Af (18.32)\rtan a \rwhere sd \" draw stress, MPa (lb/in2); m \" die-work coef\ufb01cient of friction; a \" die angle (half-angle) as de\ufb01ned in Figure 18.40; and \u00f8 is a factor that accounts for inhomogeneous deformation which is determined as follows for a round cross section: \r\u00f8  0.88 $ 0.12LDc (18.33) \rwhere D \" average diameter of work during drawing, mm (in); and Lc \" contact length of the work with the draw die in Figure 18.40,mm (in).Values of D and Lc can be determined from the following: \rDo $ Df\rD \" (18.34a)\r2 \rDo # Df\rLc \" (18.34b)\r2 sin a The corresponding draw force is then the area of the drawn cross section multiplied by the draw stress: \r\rm Ao\rF \" Af sd \" Af Yf (1 $ )\u00f8 ln (18.35)\rtan a Af \r\rwhere F \" draw force, N (lb); and the other terms are de\ufb01ned above.

Why not take the entire reduction in a single pass through one die, as in extrusion? The answer can be explained as follows. From the preceding equations, it is clear that as the reduction increases, draw stress increases. If the reduction is large enough, draw stress will exceed the yield strength of the exiting metal. When that happens, the drawn wire will simply elongate instead of new material being squeezed through the die opening. For wire drawing to be successful, maximum draw stress must be less than the yield strength of the exiting metal. \rIt is a straightforward matter to determine this maximum draw stress and the resulting maximum possible reduction that can be made in one pass, under certain assumptions. Assume a perfectly plastic metal (n \" 0), no friction, and no redundant work. In this ideal case, the maximum possible draw stress is equal to the yield strength of the work material. Expressing this using the equation for draw stress under conditions of ideal deformation, Equation (18.31), and setting Yf \" Y (because n  0), \rAo Ao 1 \rsd \" Yf ln \" Y ln \" Y ln \" Y\rAf Af 1r \rThis means that ln(Ao/Af) \" ln(1/(1 \u2013 r)) \" 1.

Accordingly, the maximum possible area ratio is \rAo \r\" e  2.7183 (18.36)\rAf \rand the maximum possible reduction is \re1 \rrmax \" 0.632 (18.37)\re \rThe value given by Equation (18.37) is often used as the theoretical maximum reduction possible in a single draw, even though it ignores (1) the effects of friction and redundant work, which would reduce the maximum possible value, and (2) strain hardening, which would increase the maximum possible reduction because the exiting wire would be stronger than the starting metal.

It is most frequently used to produce round cross sections, but squares and other shapes are also drawn. Wire drawing is an important industrial process, providing commercial products such as electrical wire and cable; wire stock for fences, coat hangers, and shopping carts; and rod stock to produce nails, screws, rivets, springs, and other hardware items. Bar drawing is used to produce metal bars for machining, forging, and other processes. \rAdvantages of drawing in these applications include (1) close dimensional control, (2) good surface \ufb01nish, (3) improved mechanical properties such as strength and hardness, and (4) adaptability to economical batch or mass production. Drawing speeds are as high as 50 m/s (10,000 ft/min) for very \ufb01ne wire. In the case of bar drawing to provide stock for machining, the operation improves the machinability of the bar (Section 23.1). \rDrawing Equipment Bar drawing is accomplished on a machine called a draw bench, consisting of an entry table, die stand (which contains the draw die), carriage, and exit rack. The arrangement is shown in Figure 18.41. The carriage is used to pull the stock through the draw die. It is powered by hydraulic cylinders or motor-driven chains.The die stand is often designed to hold more than one die,so that several bars can be pulled simultaneously through their respective dies. \rWire drawing is done on continuous drawing machines that consist of multiple draw dies, separated by accumulating drums between the dies, as in Figure 18.42. Each drum, called a capstan, is motor-driven to provide the proper pull force to \r\rFIGURE 18.41 \rHydraulically operateddraw bench for drawing metal bars. \r\r\rdraw the wire stock through the upstream die. It also maintains a modest tension on the wire as it proceeds to the next draw die in the series. Each die provides a certain amount of reduction in the wire, so that the desired total reduction is achieved by the series. Depending on the metal to be processed and the total reduction, annealing of the wire is sometimes required between groups of dies in the series. \rDraw Dies Figure 18.43 identi\ufb01es the features of a typical draw die. Four regions of the die can be distinguished: (1) entry, (2) approach angle, (3) bearing surface (land), and (4) back relief. The entry region is usually a bell-shaped mouth that does not contact the work. Its purpose is to funnel the lubricant into the die and prevent scoring of work and die surfaces.The approach is where the drawing process occurs. It is cone-shaped with an angle (half-angle) normally ranging from about 6\u00b0 to 20\u00b0. The proper angle varies according to work material. The bearing surface, or land, determines the size of the \ufb01nal drawn stock. Finally, the back relief is the exit zone. \r\rIt is provided with a back relief angle (half-angle) of about 30\u00b0. Draw dies are made of tool steels or cemented carbides. Dies for high-speed wire drawing operations frequently use inserts made of diamond (both synthetic and natural) for the wear surfaces. \rPreparation of the Work Prior to drawing, the beginning stock must be properly prepared. This involves three steps: (1) annealing, (2) cleaning, and (3) pointing. The purpose of annealing is to increase the ductility of the stock to accept deformation during drawing. As previously mentioned, annealing is sometimes needed between steps in continuous drawing. Cleaning of the stock is required to prevent damage of the work surface and draw die. It involves removal of surface contaminants (e.g., scale and rust) by means of chemical pickling or shot blasting.

The purpose of annealing is to increase the ductility of the stock to accept deformation during drawing. As previously mentioned, annealing is sometimes needed between steps in continuous drawing. Cleaning of the stock is required to prevent damage of the work surface and draw die. It involves removal of surface contaminants (e.g., scale and rust) by means of chemical pickling or shot blasting. In some cases, prelubrication of the work surface is accomplished subsequent to cleaning. \rPointing involves the reduction in diameter of the starting end of the stock so that it can be inserted through the draw die to start the process. This is usually accomplished by swaging, rolling, or turning. The pointed end of the stock is then gripped by the carriage jaws or other device to initiate the drawing process. \rDrawing can be used to reduce the diameter or wall thickness of seamless tubes and pipes, after the initial tubing has been produced by some other process such as extru-sion.Tube drawing can be carried out either with or without a mandrel.The simplest method uses no mandrel and is used for diameter reduction, as in Figure 18.44. The term tube sinking is sometimes applied to this operation. \r\r\r18.6.3 TUBE DRAWING \r\r\r\rThe problem with tube drawing in which no mandrel is used, as in Figure 18.44, is that it lacks control over the inside diameter and wall thickness of the tube. This is why mandrels of various types are used, two of which are illustrated in Figure 18.45. The \ufb01rst, Figure 18.45(a), uses a \ufb01 xed mandrel attached to a long support bar to establish inside diameter and wall thickness during the operation. Practical limitations on the length of the support bar in this method restrict the length of the tube that can be drawn. The second type, shown in (b), uses a \ufb02 oating plug whose shape is designed so that it \ufb01nds a \u201cnatural\u201d position in the reduction zone of the die. This method removes the limitations on work length present with the \ufb01xed mandrel. \r\r[1] Altan,T.,Oh,S-I,and Gegel,H.L. Metal Forming: Fundamentals and Applications.

Typical sheet-metal thicknesses are between 0.4 mm (1/64 in) and 6 mm (1/4 in). When thickness exceeds about 6 mm, the stock is usually referred to as plate rather than sheet.The sheet or plate stock used in sheet metalworking is produced by \ufb02at rolling (Section 18.1). The most commonly used sheet metal is low carbon steel (0.06%\u20130.15% C is typical). Its low cost and good formability, combined with suf\ufb01cient strength for most product applications, make it ideal as a starting material. \rThe commercial importance of sheet metalworking is signi\ufb01cant. Consider the number of consumer and industrial products that include sheet or plate metal parts: automobile and truck bodies, airplanes, railway cars, locomotives, farm and construction equipment, appliances, of\ufb01ce furniture, and more. Although these examples are conspicuous because they have sheet-metal exteriors, many of their internal components are also made of sheet or plate stock. Sheet-metal parts are generally characterized by high strength, good dimensional accuracy, good surface \ufb01nish, and relatively low cost. For components that must be made in large quantities, economical mass-production operations can be designed to process the parts.Aluminum beverage cans are a prime example. \rSheet-metal processing is usually performed at room temperature (cold working). The exceptions are when the stock is thick, the metal is brittle, or the deformation is signi\ufb01cant. These are usually cases of warm working rather than hot working. \rMost sheet-metal operations are performed on machine tools called presses. The term stamping press is used to distinguish these presses from forging and extrusion presses. The tooling that performs sheet metalwork is called a punch-and-die; the term stamping die is also used.The sheet-metal products are called stampings. To facilitate mass production, the sheet metal is often presented to the press as long strips or coils. Various types of punch-and-die tooling and stamping presses are described in Section 19.5. Final sections of the chapter cover various operations that do not utilize conventional punch-and-die tooling, and most of them are not performed on stamping presses. \r\rThe three major categories of sheet-metal processes are (1) cutting, (2) bending, and (3) drawing. Cutting is used to separate large sheets into smaller pieces, to cut out part perimeters, and to make holes in parts. Bending and drawing are used to form sheet-metal parts into their required shapes. \r\r\r\rCutting Operations \rCutting of sheet metal is accomplished by a shearing action between two sharp cutting edges. The shearing action is depicted in the four stop-action sketches of Figure 19.1, in which the upper cutting edge (the punch) sweeps down past a stationary lower cutting edge (the die). As the punch begins to push into the work, plastic deformation occurs in the surfaces of the sheet. As the punch moves downward, penetration occurs in which the punch compresses the sheet and cuts into the metal.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4007, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea1a50af-ea81-40a6-93e1-21fc9f206572": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea1a50af-ea81-40a6-93e1-21fc9f206572", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec19.txt", "file_name": "sec19.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 67207, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "497c754e-9a5d-4380-a686-773a847c962b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec19.txt", "file_name": "sec19.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 67207, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "b29931ecbd0714efe637ab5456e91b5ad607b341fd758599715d34171096019e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3887005a-8e40-47d1-9861-10181fe1572d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec19.txt", "file_name": "sec19.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 67207, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "e2bbe83f49d32d5750408ea0db8cacfd0070d99f3d31369f77d061ce5f6d1ba4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "475478ea-1f04-4679-91de-82ba8fd7d8d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "87e682041edf694e429f34b04134e4e3799c174fb9cd504d48f4a806b50d546c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The three major categories of sheet-metal processes are (1) cutting, (2) bending, and (3) drawing. Cutting is used to separate large sheets into smaller pieces, to cut out part perimeters, and to make holes in parts. Bending and drawing are used to form sheet-metal parts into their required shapes. \r\r\r\rCutting Operations \rCutting of sheet metal is accomplished by a shearing action between two sharp cutting edges. The shearing action is depicted in the four stop-action sketches of Figure 19.1, in which the upper cutting edge (the punch) sweeps down past a stationary lower cutting edge (the die). As the punch begins to push into the work, plastic deformation occurs in the surfaces of the sheet. As the punch moves downward, penetration occurs in which the punch compresses the sheet and cuts into the metal. This penetration zone is generally about one-third the thickness of the sheet.As the punch continues to travel into the work, fracture is initiated in the work at the two cutting edges. If the clearance between the punch and die is correct, the two fracture lines meet, resulting in a clean separation of the work into two pieces. \rThe sheared edges of the sheet have characteristic features as in Figure 19.2. At the top of the cut surface is a region called the rollover. This corresponds to the depression made by the punch in the work prior to cutting. It is where initial plastic \r\r\r(b) front view of powershears equipped withinclined upper cuttingblade. Symbol v indicates motion. \r\rdeformation occurred in the work. Just below the rollover is a relatively smooth region called the burnish. This results from penetration of the punch into the work before fracture began. Beneath the burnish is the fractured zone, a relatively rough surface of the cut edge where continued downward movement of the punch caused fracture of the metal. Finally, at the bottom of the edge is a burr, a sharp corner on the edge caused by elongation of the metal during \ufb01nal separation of the two pieces. \r\r19.1.1 SHEARING, BLANKING, AND PUNCHING \rThe three most important operations in pressworking that cut metal by the shearing mechanism just described are shearing, blanking, and punching. \rShearing is a sheet-metal cutting operation along a straight line between two cutting edges, as shown in Figure 19.3(a). Shearing is typically used to cut large sheets into smaller sections for subsequent pressworking operations. It is performed on a machine called a power shears, or squaring shears. The upper blade of the power shears is often inclined, as shown in Figure 19.3(b), to reduce the required cutting force. \rBlanking involves cutting of the sheet metal along a closed outline in a single step to separate the piece from the surrounding stock, as in Figure 19.4(a). The part that is cut out is the desired product in the operation and is called the blank. Punching is similar to blanking except that it produces a hole, and the separated piece is scrap, called the slug. The remaining stock is the desired part. The distinction is illustrated in Figure 19.4(b). \r\r\rFIGURE 19.5 Effect of clearance: (a) clearance too small causes lessthan-optimal fracture and excessive forces; and (b) clearance toolarge causes oversized burr. Symbols v and F indicate motion and applied force,  respectively. \r\r\r19.1.2 ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF SHEET-METAL CUTTING \rProcess parameters in sheet-metal cutting are clearance between punch and die, stock thickness, type of metal and its strength, and length of the cut. This section de\ufb01nes these parameters and some of the relationships among them. \rClearance The clearance c in a shearing operation is the distance between the punch and die, as shown in Figure 19.1(a). Typical clearances in conventional press-working range between 4% and 8% of the sheet-metal thickness t. The effect of improper clearances is illustrated in Figure 19.5. If the clearance is too small, then the fracture lines tend to pass each other, causing a double burnishing and larger cutting forces. If the clearance is too large, the metal becomes pinched between the cutting edges and an excessive burr results. In special operations requiring very straight edges, such as shaving and \ufb01ne blanking (Section 19.1.3), clearance is only about 1% of stock thickness. \rThe correct clearance depends on sheet-metal type and thickness.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3193, "end_char_idx": 7537, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "475478ea-1f04-4679-91de-82ba8fd7d8d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "475478ea-1f04-4679-91de-82ba8fd7d8d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec19.txt", "file_name": "sec19.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 67207, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "497c754e-9a5d-4380-a686-773a847c962b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec19.txt", "file_name": "sec19.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 67207, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "b29931ecbd0714efe637ab5456e91b5ad607b341fd758599715d34171096019e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ea1a50af-ea81-40a6-93e1-21fc9f206572", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec19.txt", "file_name": "sec19.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 67207, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "211c20cda0647a24ef297c6519fd2e9f1249307bf1a651fddb70060e8d01b85c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "450d3ab6-93aa-4239-b138-8bca0724c090", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "da9afeebd73fe6b0f0fd60268be68460a2da5f8d07d8664d2388e461856f4f31", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "This section de\ufb01nes these parameters and some of the relationships among them. \rClearance The clearance c in a shearing operation is the distance between the punch and die, as shown in Figure 19.1(a).

For convenience, metals are classi\ufb01ed into three groups given in Table 19.1, with an associated allowance value for each group. \rTABLE \u2022 19.1 Clearance allowance value for three sheet-metal groups. \r\r\rCompiled from [3]. \r\rThese calculated clearance values can be applied to conventional blanking and hole-punching operations to determine the proper punch and die sizes. The die opening must always be larger than the punch size (obviously). Whether to add the clearance value to the die size or subtract it from the punch size depends on whether the part being cut out is a blank or a slug, as illustrated in Figure 19.6 for a circular part. Because of the geometry of the sheared edge, the outer dimension of the part cut out of the sheet will be larger than the hole size. Thus, punch and die sizes for a \rround blank of diameter Db are determined as  \rBlanking punch diameter ! Db  2c  (19.2a)  \rBlanking die diameter ! Db  (19.2b)  \rPunch and die sizes for a round hole of diameter Dh are determined as:  \rHole punch diameter ! Dh  (19.3a)  \rHole die diameter ! Dh  2c  (19.3b)  \r\rIn order for the slug or blank to drop through the die, the die opening must have an angular clearance (see Figure 19.7) of 0.25\u00b0 to 1.5\u00b0 on each side. \rCutting Forces Estimates of cutting force are important because this force determines the size (tonnage) of the press needed. Cutting force F in sheet metalworking can be determined by \rF ! StL (19.4) \r\r\rwhere S ! shear strength of the sheet metal, MPa (lb/in2); t ! stock thickness, mm (in), and L ! length of the cut edge, mm (in). In blanking, punching, slotting, and similar operations, L is the perimeter length of the blank or hole being cut. The minor effect of clearance in determining the value of L can be neglected. If shear strength is unknown, an alternative way of estimating the cutting force is to use the tensile strength: \rF  0.7(TS)tL (19.5) \r\rwhere TS  ultimate tensile strength MPa (lb/in2). \rThese equations for estimating cutting force assume that the entire cut along the sheared edge length L is made at the same time. In this case the cutting force will be a maximum. It is possible to reduce the maximum force by using an angled cutting edge on the punch or die, as in Figure 19.3(b). The angle (called the shear angle), spreads the cut over time and reduces the force experienced at any one moment. However, the total energy required in the operation is the same, whether it is concentrated into a brief moment or distributed over a longer time period. \r\rA round disk of 150-mm diameter is to be blanked from a strip of 3.2-mm, half-hard cold-rolled steel whose shear strength  310 MPa.

The cutting mechanism in each case involves the same shearing action discussed above. \rCutoff and Parting Cutoff is a shearing operation in which blanks are separated from a sheet-metal strip by cutting the opposite sides of the part in sequence, as shown in Figure 19.8(a). With each cut, a new part is produced. The features of \rSlot \r\r\r\rSlug \r(a) \r\r\ra cutoff operation that distinguish it from a conventional shearing operation are \r(1) the cut edges are not necessarily straight, and (2) the blanks can be nested on the strip in such a way that scrap is avoided. \rParting involves cutting a sheet-metal strip by a punch with two cutting edges that match the opposite sides of the blank, as shown in Figure 19.8(b). This might be required because the part outline has an irregular shape that precludes perfect nesting of the blanks on the strip. Parting is less ef\ufb01cient than cutoff in the sense that it results in some wasted material. \rSlotting, Perforating, and Notching Slotting is the term sometimes used for a punching operation that cuts out an elongated or rectangular hole, as pictured in Figure 19.9(a). Perforating involves the simultaneous punching of a pattern of holes in sheet metal, as in Figure 19.9(b). The hole pattern is usually for decorative purposes, or to allow passage of light, gas, or \ufb02uid. \rTo obtain the desired outline of a blank, portions of the sheet metal are often removed by notching and seminotching. Notching involves cutting out a portion of metal from the side of the sheet or strip. Seminotching removes a portion of metal from the interior of the sheet.These operations are depicted in Figure 19.9(c).Seminotching might seem to the reader to be the same as a punching or slotting operation. The difference is that the metal removed by seminotching creates part of the blank outline, while punching and slotting create holes in the blank. \r\rNotching Cutoff line \rV \r\r\r\rSeminotching Completedblank \r(b) (c) \r\rFIGURE 19.9 (a) Slotting, (b) perforating, (c) notching and seminotching.

The term has the same basic meaning here as in forging (Section 18.4). A typical example in sheet metalwork is trimming the upper portion of a deep drawn cup to leave the desired dimensions on the cup. \rShaving is a shearing operation performed with very small clearance to obtain accurate dimensions and cut edges that are smooth and straight, as pictured in Figure 19.10(a). Shaving is typically performed as a secondary or \ufb01nishing operation on parts that have been previously cut. \rFine blanking is a shearing operation used to blank sheet-metal parts with close tolerances and smooth, straight edges in one step, as illustrated in Figure 19.10(b). At the start of the cycle, a pressure pad with a V-shaped projection applies a holding force Fh against the work adjacent to the punch in order to compress the metal and prevent distortion.The punch then descends with a slower-than-normal velocity and smaller clearances to provide the desired dimensions and cut edges. The process is usually reserved for relatively small stock thicknesses. \r\r\r\rBending Operations \rBending in sheet-metal work is de\ufb01ned as the straining of the metal around a straight axis,as in Figure 19.11.During the bending operation,the metal on the inside of the neutral plane is compressed, while the metal on the outside of the neutral plane is stretched. These strain conditions can be seen in Figure 19.11(b).The metal is plastically deformed \rmetal occur in bending. (a) (b) \r\r\rso that the bend takes a permanent set upon removal of the stresses that caused it. Bending produces little or no change in the thickness of the sheet metal. \r\r19.2.1 V-BENDING AND EDGE BENDING \rBending operations are performed using punch and die tooling. The two common bending methods and associated tooling are V-bending, performed with a V-die; and edge bending, performed with a wiping die. These methods are illustrated in Figure 19.12. \rIn V-bending, the sheet metal is bent between a V-shaped punch and die. Included angles ranging from very obtuse to very acute can be made with V-dies.V-bending is generally used for low-production operations. It is often performed on a press brake (Section 19.5.2), and the associated V-dies are relatively simple and inexpensive. \rEdge bending involves cantilever loading of the sheet metal. A pressure pad is used to apply a force Fh to hold the base of the part against the die, while the punch forces the part to yield and bend over the edge of the die. In the setup shown in Figure 19.12(b), edge bending is limited to bends of 90\u00b0 or less. More complicated wiping dies can be designed for bend angles greater than 90\u00b0. Because of the pressure pad, wiping dies are more complicated and costly than V-dies and are generally used for high-production work. \r\r\r19.2.2 ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF BENDING \rSome of the important terms in sheet-metal bending are identi\ufb01ed in Figure 19.11. The metal of thickness t is bent through an angle called the bend angle a.This results in a sheet-metal part with an included angle a, where a # a! 180\u00b0. The bend radius R is normally speci\ufb01ed on the inside of the part, rather than at the neutral axis, and is determined by the radius on the tooling used to perform the operation. The bend is made over the width of the workpiece w. \rBend Allowance If the bend radius is small relative to stock thickness, the metal tends to stretch during bending. It is important to be able to estimate the amount of stretching that occurs, if any, so that the \ufb01nal part length will match the speci\ufb01ed dimension.

It is important to be able to estimate the amount of stretching that occurs, if any, so that the \ufb01nal part length will match the speci\ufb01ed dimension. The problem is to determine the length of the neutral axis before bending to account for stretching of the \ufb01nal bent section. This length is called the bend allowance, and it can be estimated as follows: \r\ra\rAb  2p (R # Kbat) (19.6)\r360 \r\rwhere Ab ! bend allowance, mm (in); a ! bend angle, degrees; R ! bend radius, mm (in); t ! stock thickness, mm (in); and Kba is factor to estimate stretching. The following design values are recommended for Kba [3]: if R 2t, Kba ! 0.33; and if R & 2t, Kba ! 0.50. The values of Kba predict that stretching occurs only if bend radius is small relative to sheet thickness. \rSpringback When the bending pressure is removed at the end of the deformation operation, elastic energy remains in the bent part, causing it to recover partially toward its original shape. This elastic recovery is called springback, de\ufb01ned as the increase in included angle of the bent part relative to the included angle of the forming tool after the tool is removed. This is illustrated in Figure 19.13 and is expressed: \ra\" ab\rSB ! (19.7)\rab \r\rwhere SB ! springback; a! included angle of the sheet-metal part, degrees; and ab ! included angle of the bending tool, degrees. Although not as obvious, an increase in the bend radius also occurs due to elastic recovery. The amount of spring-back increases with modulus of elasticity E and yield strength Y of the work metal. \rCompensation for springback can be accomplished by several methods.Two common methods are overbending and bottoming. In overbending, the punch angle and radius are fabricated slightly smaller than the speci\ufb01ed angle on the \ufb01nal part so that the sheet metal springs back to the desired value. Bottoming involves squeezing the part at the end of the stroke, thus plastically deforming it in the bend region. \r\r\rBending Force The force required to perform bending depends on the geometry of the punch-and-die and the strength, thickness, and length of the sheet metal. The maximum bending force can be estimated by means of the following equation: \rKbf (TS) wt2 \rF ! (19.8)\rD \rwhere F  bending force, N (lb); TS ! tensile strength of the sheet metal, MPa (lb/in2); w  width of part in the direction of the bend axis, mm (in); t ! stock thickness, mm (in); and D  die opening dimension as de\ufb01ned in Figure 19.14, mm (in). Equation (19.8) is based on bending of a simple beam in mechanics, and Kbf is a constant that accounts for differences encountered in an actual bending process.

(Side view) (End view) \r\r\r\r\r19.2.3 OTHER BENDING AND FORMING OPERATIONS \rSome sheet-metal operations involve bending over a curved axis rather than a straight axis, or they have other features that differentiate them from the bending operations described above. \rFlanging, Hemming, Seaming, and Curling Flanging is a bending operation in which the edge of a sheet-metal part is bent at a 90\u00b0 angle (usually) to form a rim or \ufb02ange. It is often used to strengthen or stiffen sheet metal.The \ufb02ange can be formed over a straight bend axis, as illustrated in Figure 19.16(a), or it can involve some stretching or shrinking of the metal, as in (b) and (c). \rHemming involves bending the edge of the sheet over on itself, in more than one bending step. This is often done to eliminate the sharp edge on the piece, to increase stiffness, and to improve appearance. Seaming is a related operation in which two sheet-metal edges are assembled. Hemming and seaming are illustrated in Figure 19.17(a) and (b). \rCurling, also called beading, forms the edges of the part into a roll or curl, as in Figure 19.17(c). As in hemming, it is done for purposes of safety, strength, and aesthetics. Examples of products in which curling is used include hinges, pots and pans, and pocket-watch cases. These examples show that curling can be performed over straight or curved bend axes. \rMiscellaneous Bending Operations Various other bending operations are depicted in Figure 19.18 to illustrate the variety of shapes that can be bent. Most of these operations are performed in relatively simple dies similar to V-dies. \r\r\r(c) air bending, (d) offset bending, (e) corrugating, and (f) tube forming.

It is performed by placing a piece of sheet metal over a die cavity and then pushing the metal into the opening with a punch,as in Figure 19.19.The blank must usually be held down \ufb02at against the die by a blankholder. Common parts made by drawing include beverage cans, ammunition shells, sinks, cooking pots, and automobile body panels. \r\r19.3.1 MECHANICS OF DRAWING \rDrawing of a cup-shaped part is the basic drawing operation, with dimensions and parameters as pictured in Figure 19.19.A blank of diameter Db is drawn into a die cavity by means of a punch with diameter Dp.

The punch and die must have corner radii, given by Rp and Rd. If the punch and die were to have sharp corners (Rp and Rd  0), a hole-punching operation (and not a very good one) would be accomplished rather than a drawing operation.The sides of the punch and die are separated by a clearance c. This clearance in drawing is about 10% greater than the stock thickness: \rc  1.1 t (19.9) \r\rFIGURE 19.19 \r(a)\r Drawing of a cup-shaped part: (1) start of operation before punch contacts work, and \r\r(2) \rnear end of stroke; and (b) corresponding work part: (1) starting blank, and (2) drawn part. Symbols: c ! clearance, Db ! blank diameter, Dp  punchdiameter, Rd ! die corner radius, Rp ! punch corner radius, F  drawing force,Fh  holding force. \r\r\r\rThe punch applies a downward force F to accomplish the deformation of the metal, and a downward holding force Fh is applied by the blankholder, as shown in the sketch. \rAs the punch proceeds downward toward its \ufb01nal bottom position, the work experiences a complex sequence of stresses and strains as it is gradually formed into the shape de\ufb01ned by the punch and die cavity.The stages in the deformation process are illustrated in Figure 19.20. As the punch \ufb01rst begins to push into the work, the metal is subjected to a bending operation. The sheet is simply bent over the corner of the punch and the corner of the die, as in Figure 19.20(2). The outside perimeter of the blank moves in toward the center in this \ufb01rst stage, but only slightly. \rAs the punch moves further down, a straightening action occurs in the metal that was previously bent over the die radius, as in Figure 19.20(3). The metal at the bottom of the cup, as well as along the punch radius, has been moved downward with the punch, but the metal that was bent over the die radius must now be straightened in order to be pulled into the clearance to form the wall of the cylinder.At the same time, more metal must be added to replace that being used in the cylinder wall. This new metal comes from the outside edge of the blank.The metal in the outer portions of the blank is pulled or drawn toward the die opening to resupply the previously bent and straightened metal now forming the cylinder wall. This type of metal \ufb02ow through a constricted space gives the drawing process its name. \rDuring this stage of the process, friction and compression play important roles in the \ufb02ange of the blank. In order for the material in the \ufb02ange to move toward the die opening, friction between the sheet metal and the surfaces of the blankholder and the die must be overcome.

Lubricants or drawing compounds are generally used to reduce friction forces. In addition to friction, compression is also occurring in the outer edge of the blank.As the metal in this portion of the blank is drawn toward the center, the outer perimeter becomes smaller. Because the volume of metal remains constant, the metal is squeezed and becomes thicker as the perimeter is reduced. This often results in wrinkling of the remaining \ufb02ange of the blank, especially when thin sheet metal is drawn, or when the blankholder force is too low. It is a condition which cannot be corrected once it has occurred.The friction and compression effects are illustrated in Figure 19.20(4). \rThe holding force applied by the blankholder is now seen to be a critical factor in deep drawing. If it is too small, wrinkling occurs. If it is too large, it prevents the metal from \ufb02owing properly toward the die cavity, resulting in stretching and possible tearing of the sheet metal. Determining the proper holding force involves a delicate balance between these opposing factors. \rProgressive downward motion of the punch results in a continuation of the metal \ufb02ow caused by drawing and compression. In addition, some thinning of the cylinder wall occurs, as in Figure 19.20(5). The force being applied by the punch is opposed by the metal in the form of deformation and friction in the operation. A portion of the deformation involves stretching and thinning of the metal as it is pulled over the edge of the die opening. Up to 25% thinning of the side wall may occur in a successful drawing operation, mostly near the base of the cup. \r\r\r19.3.2 ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF DRAWING \rIt is important to assess the limitations on the amount of drawing that can be accomplished. This is often guided by simple measures that can be readily calculated for a given operation. In addition, drawing force and holding force are important process variables. Finally, the starting blank size must be determined. \rMeasures of Drawing One of the measures of the severity of a deep drawing operation is the drawing ratio DR. This is most easily de\ufb01ned for a cylindrical shape as the ratio of blank diameter Db to punch diameter Dp. In equation form, \rDb\rDR ! (19.10)\rDp \r\rThe drawing ratio provides an indication, albeit a crude one, of the severity of a given drawing operation. The greater the ratio, the more severe the operation. An approximate upper limit on the drawing ratio is a value of 2.0. The actual limiting value for a given operation depends on punch and die corner radii (Rp and Rd), friction conditions, depth of draw, and characteristics of the sheet metal (e.g., ductility, degree of directionality of strength properties in the metal). \rAnother way to characterize a given drawing operation is by the reduction r, where \rDb \" Dp\rr ! (19.11)\rDb \r\rIt is very closely related to drawing ratio. Consistent with the previous limit on DR (DR ! 2.0), the value of reduction r should be less than 0.50. \rA third measure in deep drawing is the thickness-to-diameter ratio t/Db (thickness of the starting blank t divided by the blank diameter Db). Often expressed as a percent, it is desirable for the t/Db ratio to be greater than 1%. As t/Db decreases, tendency for wrinkling (Section 19.3.4) increases. \rIn cases where these limits on drawing ratio, reduction, and t/Db ratio are exceeded by the design of the drawn part, the blank must be drawn in two or more steps, sometimes with annealing between the steps. \rA drawing operation is used to form a cylindrical cup with inside diameter ! \r75 mm and height  50 mm.

Because the volume of the \ufb01nal product is the same as that of the starting sheet-metal blank, then the blank diameter can be calculated by setting the initial blank volume equal to the \ufb01nal volume of the product and solving for diameter Db. To facilitate the calculation, it is often assumed that negligible thinning of the part wall occurs. \r\r19.3.3 OTHER DRAWING OPERATIONS \rThe discussion has focused on a conventional cup-drawing operation that produces a simple cylindrical shape in a single step and uses a blankholder to facilitate the process. Some of the variations of this basic operation are considered in this section. \rRedrawing If the shape change required by the part design is too severe (drawing ratio is too high), complete forming of the part may require more than one drawing step. The second drawing step, and any further drawing steps if needed, are referred to as redrawing. A redrawing operation is illustrated in Figure 19.21. \rWhen the part design indicates a drawing ratio that is too large to form the part in a single step, the following is a general guide to the amount of reduction that can be taken in each drawing operation [10]: For the \ufb01rst draw, the maximum reduction of the starting blank should be 40% to 45%; for the second draw (\ufb01rst redraw), the maximum reduction should be 30%; and for the third draw (second redraw), the maximum reduction should be 16%. \rA related operation is reverse drawing, in which a drawn part is positioned face down on the die so that the second drawing operation produces a con\ufb01guration such as that shown in Figure 19.22. Although it may seem that reverse drawing would produce a more severe deformation than redrawing, it is actually easier on the metal. The reason is that the sheet metal is bent in the same direction at the outside and inside corners of the die in reverse drawing; while in redrawing the metal is bent in the opposite directions at the two corners. Because of this difference, the metal experiences less strain hardening in reverse drawing and the drawing force is lower. \rFIGURE 19.21 \rRedrawing of a cup:\r(1) start of redraw, and (2) end of stroke.Symbols: v  punchvelocity, F  appliedpunch force, Fh ! blankholder force. \r\r\r\r(2) completion. Symbols: v ! punch velocity, F  applied punch force,Fh  blankholder force. \rDrawing of Shapes Other than Cylindrical Cups Many products require drawing of shapes other than cylindrical cups.The variety of drawn shapes include square or rectangular boxes (as in sinks), stepped cups, cones, cups with spherical rather than \ufb02at bases, and irregular curved forms (as in automobile body panels). Each shape presents unique technical problems in drawing. Eary and Reed [2] provide a detailed discussion of the drawing of these kinds of shapes. \rDrawing Without a Blankholder One of the primary functions of the blankholder is to prevent wrinkling of the \ufb02ange while the cup is being drawn. The tendency for wrinkling is reduced as the thickness-to-diameter ratio of the blank increases. If the t/Db ratio is large enough, drawing can be accomplished without a blankholder, as in Figure 19.23. The limiting condition for drawing without a blankholder can be estimated from the following [5]: \rDb \" Dp  5t (19.14) \rThe draw die must have the shape of a funnel or cone to permit the material to be drawn properly into the die cavity. When drawing without a blankholder is feasible, it has the advantages of lower cost tooling and a simpler press, because the need to separately control the movements of the blankholder and punch can be avoided. \r(1) start of process, (2) endof stroke.

A number of defects can occur in a drawn product, some of which have already been alluded to. Following is a list of common defects, with sketches in Figure 19.24: \r(a) \rWrinkling in the \ufb02 ange. Wrinkling in a drawn part consists of a series of ridges that form radially in the undrawn \ufb02ange of the work part due to compressive buckling. \r\r(b) \rWrinkling in the wall. If and when the wrinkled \ufb02ange is drawn into the cup, these ridges appear in the vertical wall. \r\r(c) \rTearing. Tearing is an open crack in the vertical wall, usually near the base of the drawn cup, due to high tensile stresses that cause thinning and failure of the metal at this location. This type of failure can also occur as the metal is pulled over a sharp die corner. \r\r(d) \rEaring. This is the formation of irregularities (called ears) in the upper edge of a deep drawn cup, caused by anisotropy in the sheet metal. If the material is perfectly isotropic, ears do not form. \r\r(e) \rSurface scratches. Surface scratches can occur on the drawn part if the punch and die are not smooth or if lubrication is insuf\ufb01cient. \r\r\r\r\r\rOther Sheet-Metal-Forming Operations \rIn addition to bending and drawing, several other sheet-metal forming operations can be accomplished on conventional presses. These are classi\ufb01ed as (1) operations performed with metal tooling and (2) operations performed with \ufb02exible rubber tooling. \r19.4.1 OPERATIONS PERFORMED WITH METAL TOOLING \rOperations performed with metal tooling include (1) ironing, (2) coining and embossing, (3) lancing, and (4) twisting. \rIroning In deep drawing the \ufb02ange is compressed by the squeezing action of the blank perimeter seeking a smaller circumference as it is drawn toward the die opening. Because of this compression, the sheet metal near the outer edge of the blank \r(1) start of process; (2) duringprocess. Note thinning andelongation of walls. Symbols v and F indicate motion and applied force, respectively. \rbecomes thicker as it moves inward. If the thickness of this stock is greater than the clearance between the punch and die, it will be squeezed to the size of the clearance, a process known as ironing. \rSometimes ironing is performed as a separate step that follows drawing.This case is illustrated in Figure 19.25. Ironing makes the cylindrical cup more uniform in wall thickness. The drawn part is therefore longer and more ef\ufb01cient in terms of material usage. Beverage cans and artillery shells, two very high-production items, include ironing among their processing steps to achieve economy in material usage. \rCoining and Embossing Coining is a bulk deformation operation discussed in the previous chapter. It is frequently used in sheet-metal work to form indentations and raised sections in the part.The indentations result in thinning of the sheet metal, and the raised sections result in thickening of the metal. \rEmbossing is a forming operation used to create indentations in the sheet, such as raised (or indented) lettering or strengthening ribs, as depicted in Figure 19.26.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 35327, "end_char_idx": 39308, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42a218c6-8e51-46c6-9540-bcf1bcf8e01a": {"__data__": {"id_": "42a218c6-8e51-46c6-9540-bcf1bcf8e01a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec19.txt", "file_name": "sec19.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 67207, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "497c754e-9a5d-4380-a686-773a847c962b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec19.txt", "file_name": "sec19.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 67207, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "b29931ecbd0714efe637ab5456e91b5ad607b341fd758599715d34171096019e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb78afc0-49db-4af9-9867-f3b377b0d5de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec19.txt", "file_name": "sec19.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 67207, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "719b3dd8cb2a6ddeb25404edb7dbd734e047ad355de76fb3eab97af5bb379d9a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7c61ee8a-68a0-44a0-9ea0-c1ac0c399ee2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d7de05d0dda329b4c1a6438274b835e602ac098bce696c971da682f057b6f8de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Sometimes ironing is performed as a separate step that follows drawing.This case is illustrated in Figure 19.25.

It is frequently used in sheet-metal work to form indentations and raised sections in the part.The indentations result in thinning of the sheet metal, and the raised sections result in thickening of the metal. \rEmbossing is a forming operation used to create indentations in the sheet, such as raised (or indented) lettering or strengthening ribs, as depicted in Figure 19.26. Some stretching and thinning of the metal are involved. This operation may seem similar to coining. However, embossing dies possess matching cavity contours, the punch containing the positive contour and the die containing the negative; whereas coining dies may have quite different cavities in the two die halves, thus causing more signi\ufb01cant metal deformation than embossing. \rLancing Lancing is a combined cutting and bending or cutting and forming operation performed in one step to partially separate the metal from the sheet. Several examples are shown in Figure 19.27.Among other applications,lancing is used to make louvers in sheet-metal air vents for heating and air conditioning systems in buildings. \r\rFIGURE 19.26 \rEmbossing: (a) crosssection of punch anddie con\ufb01guration  duringpressing; (b) \ufb01nished part with embossed ribs. \r\r\r\rtypes of cutting andforming. (a) (b) (c) \rTwisting Twisting subjects the sheet metal to a torsion loading rather than a bending load, thus causing a twist in the sheet over its length. This type of operation has limited applications. It is used to make such products as fan and propeller blades. It can be performed in a conventional punch and die which has been designed to deform the part in the required twist shape. \r\r19.4.2 RUBBER FORMING PROCESSES \rThe two operations discussed in this article are performed on conventional presses, but the tooling is unusual in that it uses a \ufb02exible element (made of rubber or similar material) to effect the forming operation.The operations are (1) the Guerin process, and (2) hydroforming. \rGuerin Process The Guerin process uses a thick rubber pad (or other \ufb02 exible material) to form sheet metal over a positive form block,as in Figure 19.28.The rubber pad is con\ufb01ned in a steel container. As the ram descends, the rubber gradually surrounds the sheet, applying pressure to deform it to the shape of the form block. It is limited to relatively shallow forms, because the pressures developed by the rubber\u2014up to about 10 MPa (1500 lb/in2) \u2014are not suf\ufb01cient to prevent wrinkling in deeper formed parts. \rThe advantage of the Guerin process is the relatively low cost of the tooling. The form block can be made of wood, plastic, or other materials that are easy to shape, and the rubber pad can be used with different form blocks. These factors \rFIGURE 19.28 Guerin process: (1) beforeand (2) after. Symbols v and F indicate motion and applied force respectively. \r\r\rmake rubber forming attractive in small-quantity production, such as the aircraft industry, where the process was developed. \rHydroforming Hydroforming is similar to the Guerin process; the difference is that it substitutes a rubber diaphragm \ufb01lled with hydraulic \ufb02uid in place of the thick rubber pad, as illustrated in Figure 19.29. This allows the pressure that forms the work part to be increased\u2014to around 100 MPa (15,000 lb/in2) \u2014thus preventing wrinkling in deep formed parts. In fact, deeper draws can be achieved with the hydroform process than with conventional deep drawing. This is because the uniform pressure in hydroforming forces the work to contact the punch throughout its length, thus increasing friction and reducing the tensile stresses that cause tearing at the base of the drawn cup. \r\r\rDies and Presses for Sheet-Metal Processes \rThis section examines the punch-and-die tooling and production equipment used in conventional sheet-metal processing.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 38423, "end_char_idx": 42734, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c61ee8a-68a0-44a0-9ea0-c1ac0c399ee2": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c61ee8a-68a0-44a0-9ea0-c1ac0c399ee2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec19.txt", "file_name": "sec19.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 67207, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "497c754e-9a5d-4380-a686-773a847c962b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec19.txt", "file_name": "sec19.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 67207, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "b29931ecbd0714efe637ab5456e91b5ad607b341fd758599715d34171096019e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "42a218c6-8e51-46c6-9540-bcf1bcf8e01a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec19.txt", "file_name": "sec19.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 67207, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "d5eea3da530a5e3b3347e692ba1749ad370e3cf981c440d6f2944d3a80898afe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3851e1a0-c431-4638-9ce6-4439728942a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c9d390d3563716e120a90d3813519f2ccaf807462f0bd2b74bb1a0b4b9d941f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Hydroforming Hydroforming is similar to the Guerin process; the difference is that it substitutes a rubber diaphragm \ufb01lled with hydraulic \ufb02uid in place of the thick rubber pad, as illustrated in Figure 19.29.

The tooling is referred to as a die. It is custom-designed for the particular part to be produced.The term stamping die is sometimes used for high-production dies. Typical materials for stamping dies are tool steel types D, A, O, and S (Table 6.5). \rComponents of a Stamping Die The components of a stamping die to perform a simple blanking operation are illustrated in Figure 19.30.The working components are the punch and die, which perform the cutting operation. They are attached to \r\r\rFIGURE 19.30 \rComponents of a punchand die for a blankingoperation. \rthe upper and lower portions of the die set, respectively called the punch holder (or upper shoe) and die holder (lower shoe). The die set also includes guide pins and bushings to ensure proper alignment between the punch and die during the stamping operation.The die holder is attached to the base of the press,and the punch holder is attached to the ram. Actuation of the ram accomplishes the pressworking operation. \rIn addition to these components, a die used for blanking or hole-punching must include a means of preventing the sheet metal from sticking to the punch when it is retracted upward after the operation.The newly created hole in the stock is the same size as the punch, and it tends to cling to the punch on its withdrawal. The device in the die that strips the sheet metal from the punch is called a stripper. It is often a simple plate attached to the die as in Figure 19.30, with a hole slightly larger than the punch diameter. \rFor dies that process strips or coils of sheet metal, a device is required to stop the sheet metal as it advances through the die between press cycles.That device is called (try to guess) a stop. Stops range from simple solid pins located in the path of the strip to block its forward motion, to more complex mechanisms synchronized to rise and retract with the actuation of the press.The simpler stop is shown in Figure 19.30. \rThere are other components in pressworking dies, but the preceding description provides an introduction to the terminology. \rTypes of Stamping Dies Aside from differences in stamping dies related to the operations they perform (e.g., cutting, bending, drawing), other differences deal with the number of separate operations to be performed in each press actuation and how they are accomplished. \rThe type of die considered above performs a single blanking operation with each stroke of the press and is called a simple die. Other dies that perform a single operation include V-dies (Section 19.2.1). More complicated pressworking dies include compound dies, combination dies, and progressive dies. A compound die performs two operations at a single station, such as blanking and punching, or blanking and drawing [2]. A good example is a compound die that blanks and punches a washer. A combination die is less common; it performs two operations at two different stations in the die. Examples of applications include blanking two different parts (e.g., right-hand and left-hand parts), or blanking and then bending the same part [2]. \r\rFIGURE 19.31 \r(a) Progressive dieand (b) associatedstrip development. \rA progressive die performs two or more operations on a sheet-metal coil at two or more stations with each press stroke.The part is fabricated progressively.The coil is fed from one station to the next and different operations (e.g., punching, notching, bending, and blanking) are performed at each station.

The result of this procedure is called the strip development.A progressive die and associated strip development are illustrated in Figure 19.31. Progressive dies can have a dozen or more stations.They are the most complicated and most costly stamping dies,economically justi\ufb01ed only for complex parts requiring multiple operations at high-production rates. \r\r\r19.5.2 PRESSES \rA press used for sheet metalworking is a machine tool with a stationary bed and a powered ram (or slide) that can be driven toward and away from the bed to perform various cutting and forming operations. A typical press, with principal components labeled,is diagrammed in Figure 19.32.The relative positions of the bed and ram are established by the frame, and the ram is driven by mechanical or hydraulic power. When a die is mounted in the press, the punch holder is attached to the ram, and the die holder is attached to a bolster plate of the press bed. \rPresses are available in a variety of capacities, power systems, and frame types. The capacity of a press is its ability to deliver the required force and energy to accomplish the stamping operation. This is determined by the physical size of the press and by its power system. The power system refers to whether mechanical or hydraulic power is used and the type of drive used to transmit the power to the ram. Production rate is another important aspect of capacity. Type of frame refers to the physical construction of the press. There are two frame types in common use: gap frame and straight-sided frame. \r\r\rGap Frame Presses The gap frame has the general con\ufb01guration of the letter C and is often referred to as a C-frame. Gap frame presses provide good access to the die, and they are usually open in the back to permit convenient ejection of stampings or scrap. The principal types of gap frame press are (a) solid gap frame, (b) adjustable bed, (c) open back inclinable, (d) press brake, and (e) turret press. \rThe solid gap frame (sometimes called simply a gap press) has one-piece construction, as shown in Figure 19.32. Presses with this frame are rigid, yet the C-shape allows convenient access from the sides for feeding strip or coil stock.They are available in a range of sizes,with capacities up to around 9000 kN (1000 tons).The model shown in Figure 19.33 has a capacity of 1350 kN (150 tons). The adjustable bed frame press is a variation of the gap frame, in which an adjustable bed is added to accommodate various die sizes.The adjustment feature results in some sacri\ufb01ce of tonnage capacity. The open-back inclinable press has a C-frame assembled to a base in such a way that the frame can be tilted back to various angles so that the stampings fall through the rear opening by gravity. Capacities of OBI presses range between one ton and around 2250 kN (250 tons).They can be operated at high speeds\u2014up to around 1000 strokes per minute. \rThe press brake is a gap frame press with a very wide bed, as shown in Figure 19.34. This allows a number of separate dies (simple V-bending dies are typical) to be set up in the bed,so that small quantities of stampings can be made economically.These low quantities of parts, sometimes requiring multiple bends at different angles, necessitate a manual operation. For a part requiring a series of bends, the operator moves the starting piece of sheet metal through the desired sequence of bending dies, actuating the press at each die, to complete the work needed.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 45611, "end_char_idx": 50037, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7a99630-59b3-4c43-8a60-c60071603abf": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7a99630-59b3-4c43-8a60-c60071603abf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec19.txt", "file_name": "sec19.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 67207, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "497c754e-9a5d-4380-a686-773a847c962b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec19.txt", "file_name": "sec19.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 67207, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "b29931ecbd0714efe637ab5456e91b5ad607b341fd758599715d34171096019e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3851e1a0-c431-4638-9ce6-4439728942a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec19.txt", "file_name": "sec19.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 67207, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "e6446e6d0746405e60f8a09bb36523140c8d572a7a17b035654b9fd44e3049ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "69c4897e-031a-40b9-933b-a3f5d938b3a5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "185c1fe08729749b85e34cf2e5aa6df240ae526e390a61fbb17fe687056e8dc9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Capacities of OBI presses range between one ton and around 2250 kN (250 tons).They can be operated at high speeds\u2014up to around 1000 strokes per minute. \rThe press brake is a gap frame press with a very wide bed, as shown in Figure 19.34.

(Photocourtesy of Strippit,Inc.) \rWhereas press brakes are well adapted to bending operations, turret presses are suited to situations in which a sequence of punching, notching, and related cutting operations must be accomplished on sheet-metal parts, as in Figure 19.35. Turret presses have a C-frame, although this construction is not obvious in Figure 19.36. The conventional ram and punch is replaced by a turret containing many punches of different sizes and shapes. The turret works by indexing (rotating) to the position holding the punch to perform the required operation. Beneath the punch turret is a corresponding die turret that positions the die opening for each punch. Between the punch and die is the sheet-metal blank, held by an x\u2013y positioning system that operates by computer numerical control (Section 37.3). The blank is moved to the required coordinate position for each cutting operation. \rStraight-sided Frame Presses For jobs requiring high tonnage, press frames with greater structural rigidity are needed. Straight-sided presses have full sides, giving it a box-like appearance as in Figure 19.37. This construction increases the strength and stiffness of the frame. As a result, capacities up to 35,000 kN (4000 tons) are available in straight-sided presses for sheet metalwork. Large presses of this frame type are used for forging (Section 18.3). \rIn all of these presses, gap frame and straight-sided frame, the size is closely correlated to tonnage capacity. Larger presses are built to withstand higher forces in pressworking. Press size is also related to the speed at which it can operate. Smaller presses are generally capable of higher production rates than larger presses. \rPower and Drive Systems Power systems on presses are either hydraulic or mechanical. Hydraulic presses use a large piston and cylinder to drive the ram.

The process is illustrated in Figure 19.39 for a relatively simple and gradual bend. The work part is gripped by one or more jaws on each end and then stretched and bent over a positive die containing the desired form. The metal is stressed in tension to a level above its yield point. When the tension loading is released, the metal has been plastically deformed. The combination of stretching and bending results in relatively little springback in the part. An estimate of the force required in stretch \rFIGURE 19.39 Stretch forming: (1) start ofprocess; (2) form die ispressed into the workwith force Fdie, causingit to be stretched and bent over the form. F ! stretching force. \r\rforming can be obtained by multiplying the cross-sectional area of the sheet in the direction of pulling by the \ufb02ow stress of the metal. In equation form, \rF ! LtYf (19.15) \rwhere F ! stretching force, N (lb); L ! length of the sheet in the direction perpendicular to stretching, mm (in); t ! instantaneous stock thickness, mm (in); and Yf ! \ufb02ow stress of the work metal, MPa (lb/in2). The die force Fdie shown in the \ufb01gure can be determined by balancing vertical force components. \rMore complex contours than that shown in the \ufb01gure are possible by stretch forming, but there are limitations on how sharp the curves in the sheet can be. Stretch forming is widely used in the aircraft and aerospace industries to economically produce large sheet-metal parts in the low quantities characteristic of those industries. \r\r19.6.2 ROLL BENDING AND ROLL FORMING \rThe operations described in this section use rolls to form sheet metal. Roll bending is an operation in which (usually) large sheet-metal or plate-metal parts are formed into curved sections by means of rolls. One possible arrangement of the rolls is pictured in Figure 19.40. As the sheet passes between the rolls, the rolls are brought toward each other to a con\ufb01guration that achieves the desired radius of curvature on the work. Components for large storage tanks and pressure vessels are fabricated by roll bending. The operation can also be used to bend structural shapes, railroad rails, and tubes. \rA related operation is roll straightening in which non\ufb02at sheets (or other cross-sectional forms) are straightened by passing them between a series of rolls.The rolls subject the work to a sequence of decreasing small bends in opposite directions, thus causing it to be straight at the exit. \rRoll forming (also called contour roll forming) is a continuous bending process in which opposing rolls are used to produce long sections of formed shapes from coil or strip stock. Several pairs of rolls are usually required to progressively accomplish the bending of the stock into the desired shape.The process is illustrated in Figure 19.41 for a U-shaped section. Products made by roll forming include channels, gutters, metal siding sections (for homes), pipes and tubing with seams, and various structural sections. Although roll forming has the general appearance of a rolling operation (and the tooling certainly looks similar), the difference is that roll forming involves bending rather than compressing the work.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 52721, "end_char_idx": 57272, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb8ac49e-0d53-45a0-bd75-4a8bb2b54ba2": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb8ac49e-0d53-45a0-bd75-4a8bb2b54ba2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec19.txt", "file_name": "sec19.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 67207, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "497c754e-9a5d-4380-a686-773a847c962b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec19.txt", "file_name": "sec19.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 67207, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "b29931ecbd0714efe637ab5456e91b5ad607b341fd758599715d34171096019e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "69c4897e-031a-40b9-933b-a3f5d938b3a5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec19.txt", "file_name": "sec19.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 67207, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "1ec2497da428e1e7872c569df2ea7d570a0a39d8a693a773cfc4a6798ddd5699", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "372285cf-0cf3-4a4c-a583-fa2738d61eee", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f3f284b13c845b83d37edf435a24b7deb710fdabdccbdb5afb759e234049ca7f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Roll forming (also called contour roll forming) is a continuous bending process in which opposing rolls are used to produce long sections of formed shapes from coil or strip stock.

Although roll forming has the general appearance of a rolling operation (and the tooling certainly looks similar), the difference is that roll forming involves bending rather than compressing the work. \r\r\r\r19.6.3 SPINNING \rSpinning is a metal-forming process in which an axially symmetric part is gradually shaped over a mandrel or form by means of a rounded tool or roller. The tool or roller applies a very localized pressure (almost a point contact) to deform the work by axial and radial motions over the surface of the part. Basic geometric shapes typically produced by spinning include cups, cones, hemispheres, and tubes. There are three types of spinning operations: (1) conventional spinning, (2) shear spinning, and (3) tube spinning. \rConventional Spinning Conventional spinning is the basic spinning operation. As illustrated in Figure 19.42, a sheet-metal disk is held against the end of a rotating mandrel of the desired inside shape of the \ufb01nal part, while the tool or roller deforms the metal against the mandrel. In some cases, the starting work part is other than a \ufb02at disk.The process requires a series of steps,as indicated in the \ufb01gure,to complete \rFIGURE 19.42 \rConventional spinning: (1) setup atstart of process;\r(2)\r during spinning; and\r\r(3)\r completion of process. \r\r\r\rthe shaping of the part. The tool position is controlled either by a human operator, using a \ufb01xed fulcrum to achieve the required leverage, or by an automatic method such as numerical control. These alternatives are manual spinning and power spinning. Power spinning has the capability to apply higher forces to the operation, resulting in faster cycle times and greater work size capacity. It also achieves better process control than manual spinning. \rConventional spinning bends the metal around a moving circular axis to conform to the outside surface of the axisymmetric mandrel.The thickness of the metal therefore remains unchanged (more or less) relative to the starting disk thickness. The diameter of the disk must therefore be somewhat larger than the diameter of the resulting part. The required starting diameter can be \ufb01gured by assuming constant volume, before and after spinning. \rApplications of conventional spinning include production of conical and curved shapes in low quantities. Very large diameter parts\u2014up to 5 m (15 ft) or more\u2014can be made by spinning. Alternative sheet-metal processes would require excessively high die costs.The form mandrel in spinning can be made of wood or other soft materials that are easy to shape. It is therefore a low-cost tool compared to the punch and die required for deep drawing, which might be a substitute process for some parts. \rShear Spinning In shear spinning, the part is formed over the mandrel by a shear deformation process in which the outside diameter remains constant and the wall thickness is therefore reduced, as in Figure 19.43. This shear straining (and consequent thinning of the metal) distinguishes this process from the bending action in conventional spinning. Several other names have been used for shear spinning, including \ufb02ow turning, shear forming, and spin forging. The process has been applied in the aerospace industry to form large parts such as rocket nose cones. \rFor the simple conical shape in the \ufb01gure, the resulting thickness of the spun wall can be readily determined by the sine law relationship: \rtf ! t sin a (19.16) \rwhere tf ! the \ufb01nal thickness of the wall after spinning, t ! the starting thickness of the disk, and a ! the mandrel angle (actually the half angle).

Tube spinning is similar to shear spinning except that the starting workpiece is a tube rather than a \ufb02at disk.The operation can be performed by applying the roller against the work externally (using a cylindrical mandrel on the inside of the tube) or internally (using a die to surround the tube). It is also possible to form pro\ufb01les in the walls of the cylinder, as in Figure 19.44(c), by controlling the path of the roller as it moves tangentially along the wall. \rSpinning reduction for a tube-spinning operation that produces a wall of uniform thickness can be determined as in shear spinning by Equation (19.17). \r19.6.4 HIGH-ENERGY-RATE FORMING \rSeveral processes have been developed to form metals using large amounts of energy applied in a very short time. Owing to this feature, these operations are called high-energy-rate forming (HERF) processes. They include explosive forming, electrohydraulic forming, and electromagnetic forming. \rExplosive Forming Explosive forming involves the use of an explosive charge to form sheet (or plate) metal into a die cavity. One method of implementing the process is illustrated in Figure 19.45. The work part is clamped and sealed over the die, and a vacuum is created in the cavity beneath.The apparatus is then placed in a large vessel of water. An explosive charge is placed in the water at a certain distance above the work. Detonation of the charge results in a shock wave whose energy is transmitted by the water to cause rapid forming of the part into the cavity.The size of the explosive charge and the distance at which it is placed above the part are largely a matter of art and experience. Explosive forming is reserved for large parts, typical of the aerospace industry. \r\rElectrohydraulic Forming Electrohydraulic forming is a HERF process in which a shock wave to deform the work into a die cavity is generated by the discharge of electrical energy between two electrodes submerged in a transmission \ufb02 uid (water). Owing to its principle of operation, this process is also called electric discharge forming. The setup for the process is illustrated in Figure 19.46. Electrical energy is accumulated in large capacitors and then released to the electrodes. Electrohydraulic forming is similar to explosive forming. The difference is in the method of generating the energy and the smaller amounts of energy that are released. This limits electrohydraulic forming to much smaller part sizes. \rElectromagnetic Forming Electromagnetic forming, also called magnetic pulse forming, is a process in which sheet metal is deformed by the mechanical force of an electromagnetic \ufb01eld induced in the work part by an energized coil. The coil, energized by a capacitor, produces a magnetic \ufb01eld. This generates eddy currents in the work that produce their own magnetic \ufb01eld. The induced \ufb01eld opposes the primary \ufb01eld, producing a mechanical force that deforms the part into the surrounding cavity. Developed in the 1960s, electromagnetic forming is the most widely used HERF process [10]. It is typically used to form tubular parts, as illustrated in Figure 19.47. \r\rFIGURE 19.46 \rElectrohydraulicforming setup. \r\r\r\rBending of Tube Stock \rSeveral methods of producing tubes and pipes are discussed in the previous chapter, and tube spinning is described in Section 19.6.3.

This section examines methods by which tubes are bent and otherwise formed. Bending of tube stock is more dif\ufb01cult than sheet stock because a tube tends to collapse and fold when attempts are made to bend it. Special \ufb02exible mandrels are usually inserted into the tube prior to bending to support the walls during the operation. \rSome of the terms in tube bending are de\ufb01ned in Figure 19.48.The radius of the bend R is de\ufb01ned with respect to the centerline of the tube. When the tube is bent, the wall on the inside of the bend is in compression, and the wall at the outside is in tension. These stress conditions cause thinning and elongation of the outer wall and thickening and shortening of the inner wall. As a result, there is a tendency for the inner and outer walls to be forced toward each other to cause the cross section of the tube to \ufb02atten. Because of this \ufb02attening tendency, the minimum bend radius R that the tube can be bent is about 1.5 times the diameter D when a mandrel is used and 3.0 times D when no mandrel is used [10]. The exact value depends on the wall factor WF, which is the diameter D divided by wall thickness \rt. Higher values of WF increase the minimum bend radius; that is, tube bending is more dif\ufb01cult for thin walls. Ductility of the work material is also an important factor in the process. \rSeveral methods to bend tubes (and similar sections) are illustrated in Figure 19.49. Stretch bending is accomplished by pulling and bending the tube around a \ufb01xed form block, as in Figure 19.49(a). Draw bending is performed by clamping the tube against a form block, and then pulling the tube through the bend by \rFIGURE 19.48 \rDimensions and terms for a bent tube: D  outside diameter of tube, R  bend radius, t  wall thickness. \r\r\rFIGURE 19.49 Tube bending methods:\r(a)\r stretch bending,\r\r(b)\r draw bending, and\r\r(c)\r compression bending.

The most important branch of the family is conventional machining, in which a sharp cutting tool is used to mechanically cut the material to achieve the desired geometry. The three most common machining processes are turning, drilling, and milling. The \u201cother machining operations\u201d in Figure 20.1 include shaping, planing, broaching, and sawing. This chapter begins the coverage of machining, which runs through Chapter 23. \rAnother group of material removal processes is the abrasive processes, which mechanically remove material by the action of hard, abrasive particles. This process group, which includes grinding, is covered in Chapter 24. The \u201cother abrasive processes\u201d in Figure 20.1 include honing, lapping, and super\ufb01 nishing. Finally, there are the nontraditional processes, which use various energy forms other than a sharp cutting tool or abrasive particles to remove material. The energy forms include mechanical, electrochemical, thermal, and chemical.1 The nontraditional processes are discussed in Chapter 25. \rMachining is a manufacturing process in which a sharp cutting tool is used to cut away material to leave \r1Some of the mechanical energy forms in the nontraditional processes use abrasive particles, and so they overlap with the abrasive processes in Chapter 24. \r\r\rFIGURE 20.1 \rClassi\ufb01cation of material removal processes. \rthe desired part shape. The predominant cutting action in machining involves shear deformation of the work material to form a chip; as the chip is removed, a new surface is exposed.Machining is most frequently applied to shape metals.The process is illustrated in the diagram of Figure 20.2. \rMachining is one of the most important manufacturing processes.The Industrial Revolution and the growth of the manufacturing-based economies of the world can be traced largely to the development of the various machining operations (Historical Note 21.1). Machining is important commercially and technologically for several reasons: \r\r\r\u27a2 \rVariety of work materials. Machining can be applied to a wide variety of work materials. Virtually all solid metals can be machined. Plastics and plastic composites can also be cut by machining. Ceramics pose dif\ufb01culties because of their high hardness and brittleness; however, most ceramics can be successfully cut by the abrasive machining processes discussed in Chapter 24. \r\r\u27a2 \rVariety of part shapes and geometric features. Machining can be used to create any regular geometries, such as \ufb02at planes, round holes, and cylinders. By introducing variations in tool shapes and tool paths, irregular geometries can be created, such as screw threads and T-slots. By combining several machining operations in sequence, shapes of almost unlimited complexity and variety can be produced. \r\r\u27a2 \rDimensional accuracy.

A machining operation generally takes more time to shape a given part than alternative shaping processes such as casting or forging. \r\r\rMachining is generally performed after other manufacturing processes such as casting or bulk deformation (e.g., forging, bar drawing). The other processes create the general shape of the starting work part, and machining provides the \ufb01nal geometry, dimensions, and \ufb01nish. \r\r\r\r\rOverview of Machining Technology \rMachining is not just one process; it is a group of processes. The common feature is the use of a cutting tool to form a chip that is removed from the work part. To perform the operation, relative motion is required between the tool and work. This relative motion is achieved in most machining operations by means of a primary motion, called the cutting speed, and a secondary motion, called the feed. The shape of the tool and its penetration into the work surface, combined with these motions, produces the desired geometry of the resulting work surface. \rTypes of Machining Operations There are many kinds of machining operations, each of which is capable of generating a certain part geometry and surface texture. These operations are discussed in considerable detail in Chapter 21, but for now it is appropriate to identify and de\ufb01ne the three most common types: turning, drilling, and milling, illustrated in Figure 20.3. \rSpeed motion (tool) \r\r\rCutting tool \rDrill Feed \rbit motion (tool) \r\rWork \r(a) (b) \r\rSpeed motionRotation Milling cutter New surface New surface \rFeed motion\rFeed motion (work) (work) \rWork \rWork \r(c) (d) \rIn turning, a cutting tool with a single cutting edge is used to remove material from a rotating workpiece to generate a cylindrical shape, as in Figure 20.3(a). The speed motion in turning is provided by the rotating work part, and the feed motion is achieved by the cutting tool moving slowly in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation of the workpiece. Drilling is used to create a round hole. It is accomplished by a rotating tool that typically has two cutting edges. The tool is fed in a direction parallel to its axis of rotation into the work part to form the round hole, as in Figure 20.3(b). In milling, a rotating tool with multiple cutting edges is fed slowly across the work material to generate a plane or straight surface. The direction of the feed motion is perpendicular to the tool\u2019s axis of rotation. The speed motion is provided by the rotating milling cutter.The two basic forms of milling are peripheral milling and face milling, as in Figure 20.3(c) and (d). \rOther conventional machining operations include shaping, planing, broaching, and sawing (Section 21.6). Also, grinding and similar abrasive operations are often included within the category of machining. These processes commonly follow the conventional machining operations and are used to achieve a superior surface \ufb01nish on the work part. \rThe Cutting Tool A cutting tool has one or more sharp cutting edges and is made of a material that is harder than the work material. The cutting edge serves to separate a chip from the parent work material, as in Figure 20.2. Connected to the cutting edge are two surfaces of the tool: the rake face and the \ufb02ank. The rake face, which directs the \ufb02ow of the newly formed chip, is oriented at a certain angle called the rake angle a.

The cutting edge serves to separate a chip from the parent work material, as in Figure 20.2. Connected to the cutting edge are two surfaces of the tool: the rake face and the \ufb02ank. The rake face, which directs the \ufb02ow of the newly formed chip, is oriented at a certain angle called the rake angle a. It is measured relative to a plane perpendicular to the work surface. \rFIGURE 20.3 The three most common types of machiningprocesses: (a) turning,\r(b)\r drilling, and twoforms of milling: (c)peripheral milling, and\r\r(d)\r face milling. \r\r\r\r\rThe rake angle can be positive, as in Figure 20.2(a), or negative as in (b). The \ufb02ank of the tool provides a clearance between the tool and the newly generated work surface, thus protecting the surface from abrasion, which would degrade the \ufb01nish. This \ufb02ank surface is oriented at an angle called the relief angle. \rMost cutting tools in practice have more complex geometries than those in Figure 20.2. There are two basic types, examples of which are illustrated in Figure 20.4: (a) single-point tools and (b) multiple-cutting-edge tools. A single-point tool has one cutting edge and is used for operations such as turning. In addition to the tool features shown in Figure 20.2, there is one tool point from which the name of this cutting tool is derived. During machining, the point of the tool penetrates below the original worksurface ofthepart.The point is usually rounded toacertainradius,called the nose radius. Multiple-cutting-edge tools have more than one cutting edge and usually achieve their motion relative to the work part by rotating. Drilling and milling use rotating multiple-cutting-edge tools. Figure 20.4(b) shows a helical milling cutter used in peripheral milling. Although the shape is quite different from a single-point tool, many elements of tool geometry are similar. Single-point and multiple-cutting-edge tools and the materials used in them are discussed in more detail in Chapter 22. \rCutting Conditions Relative motion is required between the tool and work to perform a machining operation. The primary motion is accomplished at a certain cutting speed v. In addition, the tool must be moved laterally across the work. This is a much slower motion, called the feed f. The remaining dimension of the cut is the penetration of the cutting tool below the original work surface, called the depth of cut d. Collectively, speed, feed, and depth of cut are called the cutting conditions. They form the three dimensions of the machining process, and for certain operations (e.g., most single-point tool operations) they can be used to calculate the material removal rate for the process: \rRMR \" vfd (20.1) \r\rwhere RMR \" material removal rate, mm3/s (in3/min); v \" cutting speed, m/s (ft/min), which must be converted to mm/s (in/min); f  feed, mm (in); and d  depth of cut, mm (in). \r\rThe cutting conditions for a turning operation are depicted in Figure 20.5.Typical units used for cutting speed are m/s (ft/min). Feed in turning is expressed in mm/rev (in/rev), and depth of cut is expressed in mm (in). In other machining operations, interpretations of the cutting conditions may differ. For example, in a drilling operation, depth is interpreted as the depth of the drilled hole. \rMachining operations usually divide into two categories, distinguished by purpose and cutting conditions: roughing cuts and \ufb01 nishing cuts. Roughing cuts are used to remove large amounts of material from the starting work part as rapidly as possible, in order to produce a shape close to the desired form, but leaving some material on the piece for a subsequent \ufb01 nishing operation.

Cutting speeds are lower in roughing than in \ufb01 nishing. \rA cutting \ufb02 uid is often applied to the machining operation to cool and lubricate the cutting tool. Cutting \ufb02uids are discussed in Section 22.4. Determining whether a cutting \ufb02uid should be used, and, if so, choosing the proper cutting \ufb02uid, is usually included within the scope of cutting conditions. Given the work material and tooling, the selection of these conditions is very in\ufb02uential in determining the success of a machining operation. \rMachine Tools A machine tool is used to hold the work part, position the tool relative to the work, and provide power for the machining process at the speed, feed, and depth that have been set. By controlling the tool, work, and cutting conditions, machine tools permit parts to be made with great accuracy and repeatability, to tolerances of 0.025 mm (0.001 in) and better. The term machine tool applies to any power-driven machine that performs a machining operation, including grinding. The term is also applied to machines that perform metal forming and pressworking operations (Chapters 18 and 19). \rThe traditional machine tools used to perform turning, drilling, and milling are lathes, drill presses, and milling machines, respectively. Conventional machine tools are usually tended by a human operator, who loads and unloads the work parts, changes cutting tools, and sets the cutting conditions. Many modern machine tools are designed to accomplish their operations with a form of automation called computer numerical control (Section 37.3). \r\r\rTheory of Chip Formation in Metal Machining \rThe geometry of most practical machining operations is somewhat complex. A simpli\ufb01ed model of machining is available that neglects many of the geometric complexities, yet describes the mechanics of the process quite well. It is called the orthogonal cutting model, Figure 20.6. Although an actual machining process is three-dimensional, the orthogonal model has only two dimensions that play active roles in the analysis. \r20.2.1 THE ORTHOGONAL CUTTING MODEL \rBy de\ufb01nition, orthogonal cutting uses a wedge-shaped tool in which the cutting edge is perpendicular to the direction of cutting speed.As the tool is forced into the material, the chip is formed by shear deformation along a plane called the shear plane, which is oriented at an angle \u00f8 with the surface of the work. Only at the sharp cutting edge of the tool does failure of the material occur, resulting in separation of the chip from the parent material. Along the shear plane, where the bulk of the mechanical energy is consumed in machining, the material is plastically deformed. \rThe tool in orthogonal cutting has only two elements of geometry: (1) rake angle and (2) clearance angle.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 10249, "end_char_idx": 14343, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cdd9ef2c-c535-4e2c-b120-c030ba6c9c7e": {"__data__": {"id_": "cdd9ef2c-c535-4e2c-b120-c030ba6c9c7e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec20.txt", "file_name": "sec20.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 41877, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "076ac0bb-0f32-4987-833e-6b4eed25cb40", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec20.txt", "file_name": "sec20.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 41877, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "c3022a1ee78c511b0ce239b2fd61cc250b1fb9ed19fff23029f58477a1e60c37", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0343c9ca-bc27-46e4-8263-347290b2b3bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec20.txt", "file_name": "sec20.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 41877, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4a9e230b11d89425ddcc7eef0a2fb55a52a52b8d9c35817f6ddceb5679ccf2e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "07be5197-6118-4421-b354-be82b589e39b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4e329dcb5edcf65814f1e9cec4e1438f9aba7a4b79a07a963e0c16908a600f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Although an actual machining process is three-dimensional, the orthogonal model has only two dimensions that play active roles in the analysis. \r20.2.1 THE ORTHOGONAL CUTTING MODEL \rBy de\ufb01nition, orthogonal cutting uses a wedge-shaped tool in which the cutting edge is perpendicular to the direction of cutting speed.As the tool is forced into the material, the chip is formed by shear deformation along a plane called the shear plane, which is oriented at an angle \u00f8 with the surface of the work.

Along the shear plane, where the bulk of the mechanical energy is consumed in machining, the material is plastically deformed. \rThe tool in orthogonal cutting has only two elements of geometry: (1) rake angle and (2) clearance angle. As indicated previously, the rake angle a determines the direction that the chip \ufb02ows as it is formed from the work part; and the clearance angle provides a small clearance between the tool \ufb02ank and the newly generated work surface. \rDuring cutting, the cutting edge of the tool is positioned a certain distance below the original work surface. This corresponds to the thickness of the chip prior to chip formation, to. As the chip is formed along the shear plane, its thickness increases to tc. The ratio of to to tc is called the chip thickness ratio (or simply the chip ratio) r: \r\rto\rr \" (20.2)\rtc \rSince the chip thickness after cutting is always greater than the corresponding thickness before cutting, the chip ratio will always be less than 1.0. \rIn addition to to, the orthogonal cut has a width dimension w, as shown in Figure 20.6(a), even though this dimension does not contribute much to the analysis in orthogonal cutting. \rThe geometry of the orthogonal cutting model allows us to establish an important relationship between the chip thickness ratio, the rake angle, and the shear plane angle.

If shearing were to take place across a plane of zero thickness, it would imply that the shearing action must occur instantaneously as it passes through the plane, rather than over some \ufb01 nite (although brief) time period. For the material to behave in a realistic way, the shear deformation must occur within a thin shear zone. This more realistic model of the shear deformation process in machining is illustrated in Figure 20.8. Metal-cutting experiments have indicated that the thickness of the shear zone is only a few thousandths of an inch. Since the shear zone is so thin, there is not a great loss of accuracy in most cases by referring to it as a plane. \rSecond, in addition to shear deformation that occurs in the shear zone, another shearing action occurs in the chip after it has been formed. This additional shear is referred to as secondary shear to distinguish it from primary shear. Secondary shear results from friction between the chip and the tool as the chip slides along the rake \rFIGURE 20.8 More realistic view of chipformation, showingshear zone rather than shear plane.

Four basic types of chip can be distinguished, illustrated in Figure 20.9: \r\u27a2 \rDiscontinuous chip. When relatively brittle materials (e.g., cast irons) are machined at low cutting speeds, the chips often form into separate segments (sometimes the segments are loosely attached). This tends to impart an irregular texture to the machined surface. High tool\u2013chip friction and large feed and depth of cut promote the formation of this chip type. \r\r\u27a2 \rContinuous chip. When ductile work materials are cut at high speeds and relatively small feeds and depths, long continuous chips are formed. A good surface \ufb01nish typically results when this chip type is formed. A sharp cutting edge on the tool and low tool\u2013chip friction encourage the formation of continuous chips. Long, continuous chips (as in turning) can cause problems with regard to chip disposal and/or tangling about the tool. To solve these problems, turning tools are often equipped with chip breakers (Section 22.3.1). \r\r\r\rContinuous chip \rContinuous chip \rHigh shearstrain zone \rLow shear strain zone \rGood finish typical Particle of BUE on new surface \r(b) (c) (d) \r\rFIGURE 20.9 Four types of chip formation in metal cutting: (a) discontinuous, (b) continuous, (c) continuous withbuilt-up edge, (d) serrated. \r\u27a2 Continuous chip with built-up edge. When machining ductile materials at low-to-medium cutting speeds, friction between tool and chip tends to cause portions of the work material to adhere to the rake face of the tool near the cutting edge.This formation is called a built-up edge (BUE).The formation of a BUE is cyclical; it forms and grows, then becomes unstable and breaks off. Much of the detached BUE is carried away with the chip, sometimes taking portions of the tool rake face with it, which reduces the life of the cutting tool. Portions of the detached BUE that are not carried off with the chip become imbedded in the newly created work surface, causing the surface to become rough. \rThe preceding chip types were \ufb01rst classi\ufb01ed by Ernst in the late 1930s [13].

This is the angle at which shear stress is just equal to the shear strength of the work material, and so shear deformation occurs at this angle. For all other possible shear angles, the shear stress is less than the shear strength, so chip formation cannot occur at these other angles. In effect, the work material will select a shear plane angle that minimizes energy.This angle can be determined by taking the derivative of the shear stress t in Equation (20.15) with respect to f and setting the derivative to zero. Solving for f, the relationship named after Merchant is obtained: \rf  45 $ a # b (20.16)\r22 \rAmong the assumptions in the Merchant equation is that shear strength of the work material is a constant, unaffected by strain rate, temperature, and other factors. Because this assumption is violated in practical machining operations, Equation (20.16) must be considered an approximate relationship rather than an accurate mathematical equation. Nevertheless, consider its application in the following example. \r\r\rUsing the data and results from the previous examples, determine (a) the friction angle and (b) the coef\ufb01cient of friction. \rSolution: (a) From Example 20.1, a  10\u00b0, and f  25.4\u00b0. Rearranging Equation (20.16), the friction angle can be estimated: \rb  2 (45)  10  2 (25.4) \" 49.2\u00b0 \r\r(b) The coef\ufb01cient of friction is given by Equation (20.6): m  tan 49.2 \" 1.16 \rLessons Based on the Merchant Equation The real value of the Merchant equation is that it de\ufb01nes the general relationship between rake angle, tool\u2013chip friction, and shear plane angle. The shear plane angle can be increased by (1) increasing the rake angle and (2) decreasing the friction angle (and coef\ufb01cient of friction) between the tool and the chip. Rake angle can be increased by proper tool design, and friction angle can be reduced by using a lubricant cutting \ufb02uid. \rThe importance of increasing the shear plane angle can be seen in Figure 20.12. If all other factors remain the same, a higher shear plane angle results in a smaller shear plane area. Since the shear strength is applied across this area, the shear force required to form the chip will decrease when the shear plane area is reduced. A greater shear plane angle results in lower cutting energy, lower power requirements, and lower cutting temperature. These are good reasons to try to make the shear plane angle as large as possible during machining. \rApproximation of Turning by Orthogonal Cutting The orthogonal model can be used to approximate turning and certain other single-point machining operations faiz big force small\rso long as the feed in these operations is small relative to depth of cut. Thus, most of the cutting will take place in the direction of the feed, and cutting on the point of the tool will be negligible.

The gross power required to operate the machine tool is greater than the power delivered to the cutting process because of mechanical losses in the motor and drive train in the machine.

For worn tools, the power required to perform the cut is greater, and this is re\ufb02ected in higher speci\ufb01c energy and unit horsepower values.As an approximate guide,the values in the table should be multiplied by a factor between 1.00 and 1.25 depending on the degree of dullness of the tool.

References [3], [5], [9], and [15] present some of these approaches. The method by Cook [5] was derived using experimental data for a variety of work materials to establish parameter values for the resulting equation.

The most frequently used measuring technique is the tool\u2013chip thermocouple. This thermocouple consists of the tool and the chip as the two dissimilar metals forming the thermocouple junction. By properly connecting electrical leads to the tool and work part (which is connected to the chip), the voltage generated at the tool\u2013chip interface during cutting can be monitored using a recording potentiometer or other appropriate data-collection device. The voltage output of the tool\u2013chip thermocouple (measured in mV) can be converted into the corresponding temperature value by means of calibration equations for the particular tool\u2013work combination. \rThe tool\u2013chip thermocouple has been utilized by researchers to investigate the relationship between temperature and cutting conditions such as speed and feed. \r\rRC-130B Titanium (T = 479v0.182)\r\r1600 \r\r\r1200 \r18-8 Stainless steel (T = 135v0.361) \r\r800 \rFIGURE 20.15 \rExperimentallymeasured cutting \rCutting temperature, \u00b0F \rB1113 Free machining steel (T = 86.2v0.348) \r\rtemperatures plottedagainst speed forthree work materials, indicating general agreement with Equation (20.23).

Casting can also produce a variety of shapes, but it lacks the precision and accuracy of machining. This chapter describes the important machining operations and the machine tools used to perform them. Historical Note 21.1 provides a brief narrative of the development of machine tool technology. \r\r\r\r\rMachining and Part Geometry \rMachined parts can be classi\ufb01ed as rotational or non-rotational (Figure 21.1). A rotational work part has a cylindrical or disk-like shape. The characteristic operation that produces this geometry is one in which a cutting tool removes material from a rotating work part. Examples include turning and boring. Drilling is closely related except that an internal cylindrical shape is created and the tool rotates (rather than the work) in most drilling operations. A nonrotational (also called prismatic) work part is block-like or plate-like, as in Figure 21.1(b). This geometry is achieved by linear motions of the work part, combined with either rotating or linear tool motions. Operations in this category include milling, shaping, planing, and sawing. \r\r\rMaterial removal as a means of making things dates back to prehistoric times, when man learned to carve wood and chip stones to make hunting and farming implements. There is archaeological evidence that the ancient Egyptians used a rotating bowstring mechanism to drill holes. \rDevelopment of modern machine tools is closely related to the Industrial Revolution. When James Watt designed his steam engine in England around 1763, one of the technical problems he faced was to make the bore of the cylinder suf\ufb01 ciently accurate to prevent steam from escaping around the piston. John Wilkinson built a water-wheel powered boring machine around 1775, which permitted Watt to build his steam engine. This boring machine is often recognized as the \ufb01 rst machine tool. \rAnother Englishman, Henry Maudsley, developed the \ufb01 rst screw-cutting lathe around 1800. Although the turning of wood had been accomplished for many centuries, Maudsley\u2019s machine added a mechanized tool carriage with which feeding and threading operations could be performed with much greater precision than any means before. \rEli Whitney is credited with developing the \ufb01 rst milling machine in the United States around 1818. Development of the planer and shaper occurred in England between 1800 and 1835, in response to the need to make components for the steam engine, textile equipment, and other machines associated with the Industrial Revolution.The powered drill press was developed by James Nasmyth around 1846, which permitted drilling of accurate holes in metal. \rMost of the conventional boring machines, lathes, milling machines, planers, shapers, and drill presses used today have the same basic designs as the early versions developed during the last two centuries. Modern machining centers\u2014machine tools capable of performing more than one type of cutting operation\u2014 were introduced in the late 1950s, after numerical control had been developed (Historical Note 37.1). \rEach machining operation produces a characteristic geometry due to two factors: \r(1) the relative motions between the tool and the work part and (2) the shape of the cutting tool.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4184, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19e47caf-1ac0-4fbb-9669-cffd56612108": {"__data__": {"id_": "19e47caf-1ac0-4fbb-9669-cffd56612108", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "29019680-cab8-467e-b66a-c28774bb619b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "5459d1faf2d886a349261f219b240526c29017f0c9a873b4d51caea29e409009", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ebe2692f-08b9-4229-8089-7fef7bb9c1b3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "3644a7aa2cc3eb94513a41a3b63c85bbd3efa029e3170bfd996dd0175c94f70b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "04995474-ce60-4b3b-bb1b-97fd5dd14c05", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "79a7d2bc7a4f4bb7aeeeba31c190524f8ac782c2aea7f63586d643d1310a3a3b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Development of the planer and shaper occurred in England between 1800 and 1835, in response to the need to make components for the steam engine, textile equipment, and other machines associated with the Industrial Revolution.The powered drill press was developed by James Nasmyth around 1846, which permitted drilling of accurate holes in metal. \rMost of the conventional boring machines, lathes, milling machines, planers, shapers, and drill presses used today have the same basic designs as the early versions developed during the last two centuries. Modern machining centers\u2014machine tools capable of performing more than one type of cutting operation\u2014 were introduced in the late 1950s, after numerical control had been developed (Historical Note 37.1). \rEach machining operation produces a characteristic geometry due to two factors: \r(1) the relative motions between the tool and the work part and (2) the shape of the cutting tool. These operations that create part shape are classi\ufb01ed as generating and forming. In generating, the geometry of the work part is determined by the feed trajectory of the cutting tool. The path followed by the tool during its feed motion is imparted to the work surface in order to create shape. Examples of generating include straight turning, taper turning, contour turning, peripheral milling, and pro\ufb01 le milling, all illustrated in Figure 21.2. In each of these operations, material removal is accomplished by the speed motion in the operation, but part shape is determined by the feed motion.The feed trajectory may involve variations in depth or width of cut during the operation. For example, in the contour turning and pro\ufb01le milling operations shown in the \ufb01gure, the feed motion results in changes in depth and width, respectively, as cutting proceeds. \r\r\rIn forming, the shape of the part is created by the geometry of the cutting tool. In effect, the cutting edge of the tool has the reverse of the shape to be produced on the part surface. Form turning, drilling, and broaching are examples of this case. In these operations, illustrated in Figure 21.3, the shape of the cutting tool is imparted to the work in order to create part geometry. The cutting conditions in forming usually include the primary speed motion combined with a feeding motion that is directed into the work. Depth of cut in this category of machining usually refers to the \ufb01nal penetration into the work after the feed motion has been completed. \rForming and generating are sometimes combined in one operation, as illustrated in Figure 21.4 for thread cutting on a lathe and slotting on a milling machine. In thread cutting, the pointed shape of the cutting tool determines the form of the threads, but the large feed rate generates the threads. In slotting (also called slot milling), the width of the cutter determines the width of the slot, but the feed motion creates the slot. \rMachining is classi\ufb01ed as a secondary process. In general, secondary processes follow basic processes, whose purpose is to establish the initial shape of a workpiece. Examples of basic processes include casting, forging, and bar rolling (to produce rod and bar stock). The shapes produced by these processes usually require re\ufb01nement by secondary processes. Machining operations serve to transform the starting shapes into the \ufb01nal geometries speci\ufb01ed by the part designer. For example, bar stock is the initial shape, but the \ufb01nal geometry after a series of machining operations is a shaft. The basic and secondary processes are described in more detail in Section 39.1.1 on process planning. \r\rFIGURE 21.4 \r\rCombination of forming and generating to create shape: (a) thread cutting on a lathe, and (b) slot milling. \r\r\r\r Turning and Related Operations  \rTurning is a machining process in which a single-point tool removes material from  \rthe surface of a rotating workpiece.

The tool is fed linearly in a direction parallel to  \rthe axis of rotation to generate a cylindrical geometry, as illustrated in Figures 21.2(a)  \rand 21.5. Single-point tools used in turning and other machining operations are dis \rcussed in Section 22.3.1. Turning is traditionally carried out on a machine tool called  \ra lathe, which provides power to turn the part at a given rotational speed and to feed  \rthe tool at a speci\ufb01ed rate and depth of cut.  \r21.2.1  CUTTING CONDITIONS IN TURNING  \r\r\rThe rotational speed in turning is related to the desired cutting speed at the surface of the cylindrical workpiece by the equation \rv\rN ! (21.1)\rpDo \r\r\rwhere N ! rotational speed, rev/min; v ! cutting speed, m/min (ft/min); and Do ! original diameter of the part, m (ft). \rThe turning operation reduces the diameter of the work from its original diameter Do to a \ufb01 nal diameter Df, as determined by the depth of cut d: \rDf  Do \" 2d (21.2) \r\rThe feed in turning is generally expressed in mm/rev (in/rev). This feed can be converted to a linear travel rate in mm/min (in/min) by the formula \rfr  N f (21.3) \r\rwhere fr  feed rate, mm/min (in/min); and f  feed, mm/rev (in/rev). \r\r\rThe time to machine from one end of a cylindrical work part to the other is given by \r! __ L\rTm (21.4)fr \rwhere Tm  machining time, min; and L  length of the cylindrical work part, mm (in). A more direct computation of the machining time is provided by the following equation: \rpDoL\rTm ! (21.5)\rfv \rwhere Do  work diameter, mm (in); L  work part length, mm (in); f ! feed, mm/rev (in/rev); and v ! cutting speed, mm/min (in/min).As a practical matter, a small distance is usually added to the work part length at the beginning and end of the piece to allow for approach and overtravel of the tool.Thus,the duration of the feed motion past the work will be longer than Tm. \rThe volumetric rate of material removal can be most conveniently determined by the following equation: \rRMR  vfd (21.6) \rwhere RMR  material removal rate, mm3/min (in3/min). In using this equation, the units for f are expressed simply as mm (in), in effect neglecting the rotational character of turning.Also,caremustbe exercisedtoensure thattheunits forspeedareconsistent with those for f and d. \r\r\rA turning operation is performed on a cylindrical work part whose diameter ! 120 mm and length  450 mm.

Instead of feeding the tool parallel to the axis of rotation of the work, the tool is fed at an angle, thus creating a tapered cylinder or conical shape. \r\r(c) \rContour turning. Instead of feeding the tool along a straight line parallel to the axis of rotation as in turning, the tool follows a contour that is other than straight, thus creating a contoured form in the turned part. \r\r\r\r\r(c) contour turning, (d) form turning, (e) chamfering, (f) cutoff, (g) threading, (h) boring, (i) drilling, and (j) knurling. \r(d) \rForm turning. In this operation, sometimes called forming, the tool has a shape that is imparted to the work by plunging the tool radially into the work. \r\r(e) \rChamfering. The cutting edge of the tool is used to cut an angle on the corner of the cylinder, forming a \u201cchamfer.\u201d \r\r(f) \rCutoff. The tool is fed radially into the rotating work at some location along its length to cut off the end of the part. This operation is sometimes referred to as parting. \r\r(g) \rThreading. A pointed tool is fed linearly across the outside surface of the rotating work part in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation at a large effective feed rate, thus creating threads in the cylinder. Methods of machining screw threads are discussed in greater detail in Section 21.7.1. \r\r\r(h) \rBoring. A single-point tool is fed linearly, parallel to the axis of rotation, on the inside diameter of an existing hole in the part. \r\r(i) \rDrilling. Drilling can be performed on a lathe by feeding the drill into the rotating work along its axis. Reaming can be performed in a similar way. \r\r(j) \rKnurling. This is not a machining operation because it does not involve cutting of material. Instead, it is a metal forming operation used to produce a regular cross-hatched pattern in the work surface. \r\r\rMost lathe operations use single-point tools. Turning, facing, taper turning, contour turning, chamfering, and boring are all performed with single-point tools. A threading operation is accomplished using a single-point tool designed with a geometry that shapes the thread. Certain operations require tools other than single-point. Form turning is performed with a specially designed tool called a form tool. The pro\ufb01le shape ground into the tool establishes the shape of the work part. A cutoff tool is basically a form tool. Drilling is accomplished by a drill bit (Section 22.3.2). Knurling is performed by a knurling tool, consisting of two hardened forming rolls, each mounted between centers. The forming rolls have the desired knurling pattern on their surfaces. To perform knurling, the tool is pressed against the rotating work part with suf\ufb01cient pressure to impress the pattern onto the work surface. \r\r\r21.2.3 THE ENGINE LATHE \rThe basic lathe used for turning and related operations is an engine lathe.It is a versatile machine tool,manually operated,and widely used in low and medium production.The term engine dates from the time when these machines were driven by steam engines. \rEngine Lathe Technology Figure 21.7 is a sketch of an engine lathe showing its principal components.

The headstock contains the drive unit to rotate the spindle, which rotates the work. Opposite the headstock is the tailstock, in which a center is mounted to support the other end of the workpiece. \r\r\rThe cutting tool is held in a tool post fastened to the cross-slide, which is assembled to the carriage. The carriage is designed to slide along the ways of the lathe in order to feed the tool parallel to the axis of rotation. The ways are like tracks along which the carriage rides, and they are made with great precision to achieve a high degree of parallelism relative to the spindle axis. The ways are built into the bed of the lathe, providing a rigid frame for the machine tool. \rThe carriage is driven by a leadscrew that rotates at the proper speed to obtain the desired feed rate. The cross-slide is designed to feed in a direction perpendicular to the carriage movement. Thus, by moving the carriage, the tool can be fed parallel to the work axis to perform straight turning; or by moving the cross-slide, the tool can be fed radially into the work to perform facing, form turning, or cutoff operations. \rThe conventional engine lathe and most other machines described in this section are horizontal turning machines; that is, the spindle axis is horizontal. This is appropriate for the majority of turning jobs, in which the length is greater than the diameter. For jobs in which the diameter is large relative to length and the work is heavy, it is more convenient to orient the work so that it rotates about a vertical axis; these are vertical turning machines. \rThe size of a lathe is designated by swing and maximum distance between centers. The swing is the maximum work part diameter that can be rotated in the spindle, determined as twice the distance between the centerline of the spindle and the ways of the machine. The actual maximum size of a cylindrical workpiece that can be accommodated on the lathe is smaller than the swing because the carriage and cross-slide assembly are in the way. The maximum distance between centers indicates the maximum length of a workpiece that can be mounted between headstock and tailstock centers. For example, a 350 mm  1.2 m (14 in # 48 in) lathe designates that the swing is 350 mm (14 in) and the maximum distance between centers is 1.2 m (48 in). \rMethods of Holding the Work in a Lathe There are four common methods used to hold work parts in turning. These workholding methods consist of various mechanisms to grasp the work, center and support it in position along the spindle axis,and rotate it.The methods,illustrated in Figure 21.8,are (a) mounting the work between centers, (b) chuck, (c) collet, and (d) face plate. \rHolding the work between centers refers to the use of two centers, one in the headstock and the other in the tailstock, as in Figure 21.8(a). This method is appropriate for parts with large length-to-diameter ratios.At the headstock center,a device called a dog is attached to the outside of the work and is used to drive the rotation from the spindle. The tailstock center has a cone-shaped point which is inserted into a tapered hole in the end of the work. The tailstock center is either a \u201clive\u201d center or a \u201cdead\u201d center. A live center rotates in a bearing in the tailstock, so that there is no relative rotation between the work and the live center, hence, no friction between the center and the workpiece. In contrast, a dead center is \ufb01 xed to the tailstock, so that it does not rotate; instead, the workpiece rotates about it. Because of friction and the heat buildup that results, this setup is normally used at lower rotational speeds.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 12451, "end_char_idx": 16856, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2425893-6f2a-4d90-b325-dd211e240999": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2425893-6f2a-4d90-b325-dd211e240999", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "29019680-cab8-467e-b66a-c28774bb619b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "5459d1faf2d886a349261f219b240526c29017f0c9a873b4d51caea29e409009", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "62662da3-3b4f-4870-8571-87266f53c9f4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "e9add8bb7049fd411c7c396597e025811d97a22938adf5a62927e45e8222f475", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fcf78d28-9f67-4115-bae0-e744e8f6269f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9ba5e168e89344fd0a3b29a974a496ca780f68f165b467be2daa3f1a2695043d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "This method is appropriate for parts with large length-to-diameter ratios.At the headstock center,a device called a dog is attached to the outside of the work and is used to drive the rotation from the spindle.

Because of friction and the heat buildup that results, this setup is normally used at lower rotational speeds. The live center can be used at higher speeds. \rThe chuck, Figure 21.8(b), is available in several designs, with three or four jaws to grasp the cylindrical work part on its outside diameter.The jaws are often designed so they can also grasp the inside diameter of a tubular part.A self-centering chuck has a mechanism to move the jaws in or out simultaneously, thus centering the work at the spindle axis. Other chucks allow independent operation of each jaw. Chucks can be used with or without a tailstock center. For parts with low length-to-diameter ratios, holding the part in the chuck in a cantilever fashion is usually suf\ufb01 cient to withstand the cutting forces. For long workbars, the tailstock center is needed for support. \r\rA collet consists of a tubular bushing with longitudinal slits running over half its length and equally spaced around its circumference, as in Figure 21.8(c). The inside diameter of the collet is used to hold cylindrical work such as barstock. Owing to the slits, one end of the collet can be squeezed to reduce its diameter and provide a secure grasping pressure against the work. Because there is a limit to the reduction obtainable in a collet of any given diameter, these workholding devices must be made in various sizes to match the particular work part size in the operation. \rA face plate, Figure 21.8(d), is a workholding device that fastens to the lathe spindle and is used to grasp parts with irregular shapes. Because of their irregular shape, these parts cannot be held by other workholding methods.The faceplate is therefore equipped with the custom-designed clamps for the particular geometry of the part. \r\r\r21.2.4 OTHER LATHES AND TURNING MACHINES \rIn addition to the engine lathe, other turning machines have been developed to satisfy particular functions or to automate the turning process. Among these machines are \r(1) toolroom lathe, (2) speed lathe, (3) turret lathe, (4) chucking machine, (5) automatic screw machine, and (6) numerically controlled lathe. \r\rThe toolroom lathe and speed lathe are closely related to the engine lathe. The toolroom lathe is smaller and has a wider available range of speeds and feeds. It is also built for higher accuracy, consistent with its purpose of fabricating components for tools, \ufb01xtures, and other high-precision devices. \rThe speed lathe is simpler in construction than the engine lathe. It has no carriage and cross-slide assembly,and therefore no leadscrew to drive the carriage.The cutting tool is held by the operator using a rest attached to the lathe for support. The speeds are higher on a speed lathe, but the number of speed settings is limited. Applications of this machine type include wood turning, metal spinning (Section 19.6.3), and polishing operations (Section 24.2.4). \rA turret lathe is a manually operated lathe in which the tailstock is replaced by a turret that holds up to six cutting tools. These tools can be rapidly brought into action against the work one by one by indexing the turret.

These tools can be rapidly brought into action against the work one by one by indexing the turret. In addition, the conventional tool post used on an engine lathe is replaced by a four-sided turret that is capable of indexing up to four tools into position. Hence, because of the capacity to quickly change from one cutting tool to the next, the turret lathe is used for high-production work that requires a sequence of cuts to be made on the part. \rAs the name suggests, a chucking machine (nicknamed chucker) uses a chuck in its spindle to hold the work part. The tailstock is absent on a chucker, so parts cannot be mounted between centers. This restricts the use of a chucking machine to short, light-weight parts. The setup and operation are similar to a turret lathe except that the feeding actions of the cutting tools are controlled automatically rather than by a human operator. The function of the operator is to load and unload the parts. \rA bar machine is similar to a chucking machine except that a collet is used (instead of a chuck), which permits long bar stock to be fed through the headstock into position. At the end of each machining cycle,a cutoff operation separates the new part.The bar stock is then indexed forward to present stock for the next part. Feeding the stock as well as indexing and feeding the cutting tools is accomplished automatically. Owing to its high level of automatic operation, it is often called an automatic bar machine. One of its important applications is in the production of screws and similar small hardware items; the name automatic screw machine is frequently used for machines used in these applications. \rBar machines can be classi\ufb01ed as single spindle or multiple spindle.A single spindle bar machine has one spindle that normally allows only one cutting tool to be used at a time on the single work part being machined. Thus, while each tool is cutting the work, the other tools are idle. (Turret lathes and chucking machines are also limited by this sequential, rather than simultaneous, tool operation). To increase cutting tool utilization and production rate, multiple spindle bar machines are available.These machines have more than one spindle, so multiple parts are machined simultaneously by multiple tools. For example, a six-spindle automatic bar machine works on six parts at a time, as in Figure 21.9. At the end of each machining cycle, the spindles (including collets and workbars) are indexed (rotated) to the next position. In the illustration, each part is cut sequentially by \ufb01ve sets of cutting tools, which takes six cycles (position 1 is for advancing the bar stock to a \u201cstop\u201d).With this arrangement,a part is completed at the end of each cycle. As a result, a six-spindle automatic screw machine has a very high production rate. \rThe sequencing and actuation of the motions on screw machines and chucking machines have traditionally been controlled by cams and other mechanical devices. \r\rThe modern form of control is computer numerical control (CNC), in which the machine tool operations are controlled by a \u201cprogram of instructions\u201d consisting of alphanumeric code (Section 37.3). CNC provides a more sophisticated and versatile means of control than mechanical devices. CNC has led to the development of machine tools capable of more complex machining cycles and part geometries, and a higher level of automated operation than conventional screw machines and chucking machines. The CNC lathe is an example of these machines in turning. It is especially useful for contour turning operations and close tolerance work. Today, automatic chuckers and bar machines are implemented by CNC. \r\r\r21.2.5 BORING MACHINES \rBoring is similar to turning. It uses a single-point tool against a rotating work part. The difference is that boring is performed on the inside diameter of an existing hole rather than the outside diameter of an existing cylinder. In effect, boring is an internal turning operation.

The designation refers to the orientation of the axis of rotation of the machine spindle or work part. In a horizontal boring operation, the setup can be arranged in either of two ways. The \ufb01 rst setup is one in which the work is \ufb01xtured to a rotating spindle, and the tool is attached to a cantilevered boring bar that feeds into the work, as illustrated in Figure 21.10(a). \r\r\rThe boring bar in this setup must be very stiff to avoid de\ufb02ection and vibration during cutting. To achieve high stiffness, boring bars are often made of cemented carbide, whose modulus of elasticity approaches 620  103 MPa (90  106 lb/in2). Figure 21.11 shows a carbide boring bar. \rThe second possible setup is one in which the tool is mounted to a boring bar, and the boring bar is supported and rotated between centers. The work is fastened to a feeding mechanism that feeds it past the tool.This setup,Figure 21.10(b),can be used to perform a boring operation on a conventional engine lathe. \rFIGURE 21.11 Boring bar made of cemented carbide (WC\u2013Co) that uses indexable cemented carbide inserts. (Courtesy of Kennametal Inc.) \r\r\rA vertical boring machine is used for large, heavy work parts with large diameters; usually the work part diameter is greater than its length. As in Figure 21.12, the part is clamped to a worktable that rotates relative to the machine base.Worktables up to 40 ft in diameter are available. The typical boring machine can position and feed several cutting tools simultaneously. The tools are mounted on tool heads that can be fed horizontally and vertically relative to the worktable. One or two heads are mounted on a horizontal cross-rail assembled to the machine tool housing above the worktable. The cutting tools mounted above the work can be used for facing and boring. In addition to the tools on the cross-rail, one or two additional tool heads can be mounted on the side columns of the housing to enable turning on the outside diameter of the work. \rThe tool heads used on a vertical boring machine often include turrets to accommodate several cutting tools.This results in a loss of distinction between this machine and a vertical turret lathe. Some machine tool builders make the distinction that the vertical turret lathe is used for work diameters up to 2.5 m (100 in), while the vertical boring mill is used for larger diameters [7].Also,vertical boring mills are often applied to one-of-a-kind jobs, while vertical turret lathes are used for batch production. \r\r\r\rDrilling and Related Operations \rDrilling, Figure 21.3(b), is a machining operation used to create a round hole in a work part. This contrasts with boring, which can only be used to enlarge an existing hole. Most drilling operations are performed using a rotating cylindrical tool that has two cutting edges on its working end. The tool is called a drill or drill bit, the most common form of which is the twist drill (Section 22.3.2).The rotating drill feeds into the stationary work part to form a hole whose diameter is equal to the drill diameter. Drilling is customarily performed on a drill press, although other machine tools also perform this operation. \r\r\r21.3.1 CUTTING CONDITIONS IN DRILLING \rThe cutting speed in a drilling operation is the surface speed at the outside diameter of the drill. It is speci\ufb01 ed in this way for convenience, even though nearly all of the cutting is actually performed at lower speeds closer to the axis of rotation.To set the desired cutting speed in drilling, it is necessary to determine the rotational speed of the drill.

Letting N represent the spindle rev/min, \rv\rN ! (21.7)\rpD \r\rwhere v ! cutting speed, mm/min (in/min); and D ! the drill diameter, mm (in). In some drilling operations, the workpiece is rotated about a stationary tool, but the same formula applies. \rFeed f in drilling is speci\ufb01ed in mm/rev (in/rev). Recommended feeds are roughly proportional to drill diameter; higher feeds are used with larger diameter drills. Since there are (usually) two cutting edges at the drill point, the uncut chip thickness (chip load) taken by each cutting edge is half the feed. Feed can be converted to feed rate using the same equation as for turning: \rfr  Nf (21.8) \r\rwhere fr = feed rate, mm/min (in/min). \rDrilled holes are either through holes or blind holes, shown in Figure 21.13 with a twist drill at the beginning of the operation. In through holes, the drill exits the opposite side of the work; in blind holes, it does not. The machining time required to drill a through hole can be determined by the following formula: \r! t $ A\rTm (21.9)fr \r\rwhere Tm ! machining (drilling) time, min; t ! work thickness, mm (in); fr ! feed rate, mm/min (in/min); and A ! an approach allowance that accounts for the drill point angle, representing the distance the drill must feed into the work before reaching full diameter, Figure 21.13(a). This allowance is given by \rA  0.5 D tan (90 \" u ) (21.10)\r2 \r\rwhere A  approach allowance, mm (in); and u  drill point angle, . In drilling a through hole, the feed motion usually proceeds slightly beyond the opposite side of the work, thus making the actual duration of the cut greater than Tm in Equation (21.9) by a small amount. \rIn a blind-hole, hole depth d is de\ufb01ned as the distance from the work surface to the depth of the full diameter,Figure 21.13(b).Thus,for a blind hole,machining time is given by \r! d $ A\rTm (21.11)fr \r\rwhere A  the approach allowance by Equation (21.10). \r\rThe rate of metal removal in drilling is determined as the product of the drill cross-sectional area and the feed rate: \rpD2 fr\rRMR !

Most of the operations follow drilling; a hole must be made \ufb01rst by drilling, and then the hole is modi\ufb01ed by one of the other operations. Centering and spot facing are exceptions to this rule. All of the operations use rotating tools. \r\rFIGURE 21.14 \rMachining operationsrelated to drilling:\r(a)\r reaming, (b) tapping,\r\r(c)\r counterboring,\r\r(d)\r countersinking,\r\r(e)\r center drilling, and\r\r(f)\r spot facing. \r\r\r\r(a) \rReaming. Reaming is used to slightly enlarge a hole, to provide a better tolerance on its diameter, and to improve its surface \ufb01nish. The tool is called a reamer, and it usually has straight \ufb02 utes. \r\r(b) \rTapping. This operation is performed by a tap and is used to provide internal screw threads on an existing hole.Tapping is discussed in more detail in Section 21.7.1. \r\r(c) \rCounterboring. Counterboring provides a stepped hole, in which a larger diameter follows a smaller diameter partially into the hole. A counterbored hole is used to seat a bolt head into a hole so the head does not protrude above the surface. \r\r(d) \rCountersinking. This is similar to counterboring, except that the step in the hole is cone-shaped for \ufb02at head screws and bolts. \r\r(e) \rCentering. Also called center drilling, this operation drills a starting hole to accurately establish its location for subsequent drilling. The tool is called a center drill. \r\r(f) \rSpot facing. Spot facing is similar to milling. It is used to provide a \ufb02at machined surface on the work part in a localized area. \r\r\r\r21.3.3 DRILL PRESSES \rThe standard machine tool for drilling is the drill press. There are various types of drill press, the most basic of which is the upright drill, Figure 21.15. The upright drill stands on the \ufb02oor and consists of a table for holding the work part, a drilling head with powered spindle for the drill bit, and a base and column for support. A similar drill press, but smaller, is the bench drill, which is mounted on a table or bench rather than the \ufb02 oor. \r\rThe radial drill, Figure 21.16, is a large drill press designed to cut holes in large parts. It has a radial arm along which the drilling head can be moved and clamped. The head therefore can be positioned along the arm at locations that are a signi\ufb01cant distance from the column to accommodate large work.

The head therefore can be positioned along the arm at locations that are a signi\ufb01cant distance from the column to accommodate large work. The radial arm can also be swiveled about the column to drill parts on either side of the worktable. \rThe gang drill is a drill press consisting basically of two to six upright drills connected together in an in-line arrangement. Each spindle is powered and operated independently, and they share a common worktable, so that a series of drilling and related operations can be accomplished in sequence (e.g., centering, drilling, reaming, tapping) simply by sliding the work part along the worktable from one spindle to the next. A related machine is the multiple-spindle drill, in which several drill spindles are connected together to drill multiple holes simultaneously into the work part. \rIn addition, computer numerical control drill presses are available to control the positioning of the holes in the work parts.These drill presses are often equipped with turrets to hold multiple tools that can be indexed under control of the NC program. The term CNC turret drill is used for these machine tools. \rWorkholding on a drill press is accomplished by clamping the part in a vise, \ufb01 xture, or jig. A vise is a general-purpose workholding device possessing two jaws that grasp the work in position.A \ufb01 xture is a workholding device that is usually custom-designed for the particular work part. The \ufb01xture can be designed to achieve higher accuracy in positioning the part relative to the machining operation, faster production rates, and greater operator convenience in use. A jig is a workholding device that is also specially designed for the work part. The distinguishing feature between a jig and a \ufb01 xture is that the jig provides a means of guiding the tool during the drilling operation.A \ufb01xture does not have this tool guidance feature.A jig used for drilling is called a drill jig. \r\r\r\r\r\rMilling \rMilling is a machining operation in which a work part is fed past a rotating cylindrical tool with multiple cutting edges, as illustrated in Figure 21.2 (d) and (e). (In rare cases, a tool with one cutting edge, called a \ufb02 y-cutter,is used).The axis of rotation of the cutting tool is perpendicular to the direction of feed. This orientation between the tool axis and the feed direction is one of the features that distinguishes milling from drilling. In drilling, the cutting tool is fed in a direction parallel to its axis of rotation. The cutting tool in milling is called a milling cutter and the cutting edges are called teeth.Aspects of milling cutter geometry are discussed in Section 22.3.2. The conventional machine tool that performs this operation is a milling machine. \rThe geometric form created by milling is a plane surface. Other work geometries can be created either by means of the cutter path or the cutter shape. Owing to the variety of shapes possible and its high production rates, milling is one of the most versatile and widely used machining operations. \rFIGURE 21.17 \rTwo basic types of milling operations:\r\r(a) peripheral or plainmilling and (b) facemilling. \r\rMilling is an interrupted cutting operation; the teeth of the milling cutter enter and exit the work during each revolution. This interrupted cutting action subjects the teeth to a cycle of impact force and thermal shock on every rotation. The tool material and cutter geometry must be designed to withstand these conditions. \r\r21.4.1 TYPES OF MILLING OPERATIONS \rThere are two basic types of milling operations, shown in Figure 21.17: (a) peripheral milling and (b) face milling. Most milling operations create geometry by generating the shape (Section 21.1). \rPeripheral Milling In peripheral milling, also called plain milling,the axis of the tool is parallel to the surface being machined, and the operation is performed by cutting edges on the outside periphery of the cutter. Several types of peripheral milling are shown in Figure 21.18: (a) slab milling, the basic form of peripheral milling in which \rFIGURE 21.18 \rPeripheral milling:\r\r(a)\r slab milling,\r\r(b)\r slotting,\r\r(c)\r side milling,\r\r\r(d)\r straddle milling, and\r\r(e)\r form milling. \r\r\r\r\r\r(a)\r up milling, and\r\r(b)\r down milling.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 32538, "end_char_idx": 36843, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4af899af-2785-47f8-8143-f80c151c09e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "4af899af-2785-47f8-8143-f80c151c09e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "29019680-cab8-467e-b66a-c28774bb619b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "5459d1faf2d886a349261f219b240526c29017f0c9a873b4d51caea29e409009", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "72e19081-aaaf-44d9-a022-32c656c253a7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "0c450f064b4343f0ffe5f3c308c156b338f32f079ea7a791caa10a6c5de747ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "28092f0c-e94b-4cc6-813e-18d63326394d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7377ab558aa1914ff28c7e45c99d9e4ab8854da2dd4f35b5b732fc8e1a03ece2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Most milling operations create geometry by generating the shape (Section 21.1). \rPeripheral Milling In peripheral milling, also called plain milling,the axis of the tool is parallel to the surface being machined, and the operation is performed by cutting edges on the outside periphery of the cutter.

Form milling is therefore classi\ufb01ed as a forming operation (Section 21.1). \rIn peripheral milling, the direction of cutter rotation distinguishes two forms of milling: up milling and down milling, illustrated in Figure 21.19. In up milling, also called conventional milling, the direction of motion of the cutter teeth is opposite the feed direction when the teeth cut into the work. It is milling \u201cagainst the feed.\u201d In down milling, also called climb milling, the direction of cutter motion is the same as the feed direction when the teeth cut the work. It is milling \u201cwith the feed.\u201d \rThe relative geometries of these two forms of milling result in differences in their cutting actions. In up milling, the chip formed by each cutter tooth starts out very thin and increases in thickness during the sweep of the cutter. In down milling, each chip starts out thick and reduces in thickness throughout the cut. The length of a chip in down milling is less than in up milling (the difference is exaggerated in the \ufb01 gure). This means that the cutter is engaged in the work for less time per volume of material cut, and this tends to increase tool life in down milling. \rThe cutting force direction is tangential to the periphery of the cutter for the teeth that are engaged in the work. In up milling, this has a tendency to lift the work part as the cutter teeth exit the material. In down milling, this cutter force direction is downward, tending to hold the work against the milling machine table. \rFace Milling In face milling, the axis of the cutter is perpendicular to the surface being milled, and machining is performed by cutting edges on both the end and outside periphery of the cutter. As in peripheral milling, various forms of face milling exist, several of which are shown in Figure 21.20: (a) conventional face milling, in which the diameter of the cutter is greater than the work part width, so the cutter overhangs the work on both sides; (b) partial face milling, where the cutter overhangs the work on only one side; (c) end milling, in which the cutter diameter is less than the work width, so a slot is cut into the part; (d) pro\ufb01 le milling, a form of end milling in which the outside periphery of a \ufb02at part is cut; (e) pocket milling, another form of end milling used \r\r\rFIGURE 21.20 Face milling: (a) conventionalface milling, (b) partialface milling, (c) endmilling, (d) pro\ufb01 lemilling, (e) pocketmilling, and (f) surfacecontouring. \rto mill shallow pockets into \ufb02at parts; and (f) surface contouring, in which a ball-nose cutter (rather than square-end cutter) is fed back and forth across the work along a curvilinear path at close intervals to create a three-dimensional surface form.The same basic cutter control is required to machine the contours of mold and die cavities, in which case the operation is called die sinking.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 36229, "end_char_idx": 40332, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28092f0c-e94b-4cc6-813e-18d63326394d": {"__data__": {"id_": "28092f0c-e94b-4cc6-813e-18d63326394d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "29019680-cab8-467e-b66a-c28774bb619b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "5459d1faf2d886a349261f219b240526c29017f0c9a873b4d51caea29e409009", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4af899af-2785-47f8-8143-f80c151c09e1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "5bd925f43abe23db150faffca43384c2a48d64495589308af96e272dceed6873", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4df38592-9cce-4f62-928e-7a58d6bedc5f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "12233d0204bdb7029e094140239d1b8935b3891c1f548ff614bc8f7c3721fffa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "to mill shallow pockets into \ufb02at parts; and (f) surface contouring, in which a ball-nose cutter (rather than square-end cutter) is fed back and forth across the work along a curvilinear path at close intervals to create a three-dimensional surface form.The same basic cutter control is required to machine the contours of mold and die cavities, in which case the operation is called die sinking. \r\r\r21.4.2 CUTTING CONDITIONS IN MILLING \rThe cutting speed is determined at the outside diameter of a milling cutter. This can be converted to spindle rotation speed using a formula that should now be familiar: \rv\rN ! (21.13)\rpD \r\rThe feed f in milling is usually given as a feed per cutter tooth; called the chip load, it represents the size of the chip formed by each cutting edge. This can be converted to feed rate by taking into account the spindle speed and the number of teeth on the cutter as follows: \rfr ! Nnt f (21.14) \rwhere fr ! feed rate, mm/min (in/min); N ! spindle speed, rev/min; nt ! number of teeth on the cutter; and f  chip load in mm/tooth (in/tooth). \rMaterial removal rate in milling is determined using the product of the cross-sectional area of the cut and the feed rate. Accordingly, if a slab-milling operation is cutting a workpiece with width w at a depth d, the material removal rate is \rRMR ! wd fr (21.15) \r\r\rThis neglects the initial entry of the cutter before full engagement. Equation (21.15) can be applied to end milling, side milling, face milling, and other milling operations, making the proper adjustments in the computation of cross-sectional area of cut. \rThe time required to mill a workpiece of length L must account for the approach distance required to fully engage the cutter. First, consider the case of slab milling, Figure 21.21.To determine the time to perform a slab milling operation,the approach distance A to reach full cutter depth is given by \rA ! d(D \" d) (21.16) \r\rwhere d ! depth of cut, mm (in); and D ! diameter of the milling cutter, mm (in). The time Tm in which the cutter is engaged milling the workpiece is therefore \r! L $ A\rTm (21.17)fr \r\rFor face milling, consider the two possible cases pictured in Figure 21.22. The \ufb01 rst case is when the cutter is centered over a rectangular workpiece as in Figure 21.22(a). The cutter feeds from right to left across the workpiece. In order for the cutter to reach the full width of the work, it must travel an approach distance given by \rA  0.5 ( D \" D2 \" w2 ) (21.18) \r\rwhere D  cutter diameter, mm (in) and w  width of the workpiece, mm (in). If D ! w, then Equation (21.18) reduces to A  0.5D. And if D & w, then a slot is cut into the work and A  0.5D. \rThe second case is when the cutter is offset to one side of the work, as in Figure 21.22(b). In this case, the approach distance is given by \rA ! w(D \" w) (21.19) \r\rwhere w  width of the cut, mm (in). In either case, the machining time is given by \r! L $ A\rTm (21.20)fr \r\rIt should be emphasized in all of these milling scenarios that Tm represents the time the cutter teeth are engaged in the work, making chips. Overtravel distances are usually added at the beginning and end of each cut to allow access to the work for loading and unloading. Thus the actual duration of the cutter feed motion is likely to be greater than Tm. \rFIGURE 21.22 \r\rFace milling showing approach and overtravel distances for two cases: (a) when cutter is centered over the workpiece, and \r(b) when cutter is offset to one side over the work.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 39937, "end_char_idx": 43423, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4df38592-9cce-4f62-928e-7a58d6bedc5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "4df38592-9cce-4f62-928e-7a58d6bedc5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "29019680-cab8-467e-b66a-c28774bb619b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "5459d1faf2d886a349261f219b240526c29017f0c9a873b4d51caea29e409009", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "28092f0c-e94b-4cc6-813e-18d63326394d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "792278ddfc3433f05064bacb9aaadf2b2e847ad1071c48841b4ee8a4cb4db917", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e56b5aa3-e541-4493-8e8d-84553091b9f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "62f3108b149f20f00bbcf4a5f7b22db37fd4b3a3a25b179b827aed03291c1550", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In this case, the approach distance is given by \rA ! w(D \" w) (21.19) \r\rwhere w  width of the cut, mm (in).

Various machine tool designs satisfy these requirements.To begin with,milling machines can be classi\ufb01ed as horizontal or vertical. A horizontal milling machine has a horizontal spindle, and this design is well suited for performing peripheral milling (e.g., slab milling, slotting, side and straddle milling) on work parts that are roughly cube shaped.A vertical milling machine has a vertical spindle, and this orientation is appropriate for face milling, end milling, surface contouring, and die-sinking on relatively \ufb02at work parts. \rOtherthanspindleorientation,millingmachines canbeclassi\ufb01ed intothefollowing types: (1) knee-and-column, (2) bed type, (3) planer type, (4) tracer mills, and (5) CNC milling machines. \rThe knee-and-column milling machine is the basic machine tool for milling. It derives its name from the fact that its two main components are a column that supports the spindle, and a knee (roughly resembling a human knee) that supports the worktable. \r\r\rIt is available as either a horizontal or a vertical machine, as illustrated in Figure 21.23. In the horizontal version, an arbor usually supports the cutter. The arbor is basically a shaft that holds the milling cutter and is driven by the spindle. An overarm is provided on horizontal machines to support the arbor. On vertical knee-and-column machines, milling cutters can be mounted directly in the spindle without an arbor. \rOne of the features of the knee-and-column milling machine that makes it so versatile is its capability for worktable feed movement in any of the x\u2013y\u2013z axes.

On vertical knee-and-column machines, milling cutters can be mounted directly in the spindle without an arbor. \rOne of the features of the knee-and-column milling machine that makes it so versatile is its capability for worktable feed movement in any of the x\u2013y\u2013z axes. The worktable can be moved in the x-direction, the saddle can be moved in the y-direction, and the knee can be moved vertically to achieve the z-movement. \rTwo special knee-and-column machines should be identi\ufb01ed. One is the universal milling machine, Figure 21.24(a), which has a table that can be swiveled in a horizontal plane (about a vertical axis) to any speci\ufb01ed angle. This facilitates the cutting of angular shapes and helixes on work parts. Another special machine is the ram mill, Figure 21.24(b), in which the toolhead containing the spindle is located on the end of a horizontal ram; the ram can be adjusted in and out over the worktable to locate the cutter relative to the work. The toolhead can also be swiveled to achieve an angular orientation of the cutter with respect to the work. These features provide considerable versatility in machining a variety of work shapes. \r\rBed-type milling machines are designed for high production. They are constructed with greater rigidity than knee-and-column machines, thus permitting them to achieve heavier feed rates and depths of cut needed for high material removal rates. The characteristic construction of the bed-type milling machine is shown in Figure 21.25. The worktable is mounted directly to the bed of the machine tool, rather than using the less rigid knee-type design.This construction limits the possible motion of the table to longitudinal feeding of the work past the milling cutter. The cutter is mounted in a spindle head that can be adjusted vertically along the machine column. Single spindle bed machines are called simplex mills, as in Figure 21.25, and are available in either horizontal or vertical models. Duplex millsusetwospindleheads.Theheads areusually positioned horizontally on opposite sides of the bed to perform simultaneous operations during one feeding pass of the work. Triplex mills add a third spindle mounted vertically over the bed to further increase machining capability. \rPlaner type mills are the largest milling machines. Their general appearance and construction are those of a large planer (see Figure 21.31); the difference is that milling is performed instead of planing. Accordingly, one or more milling heads are substituted for the single-point cutting tools used on planers, and the motion of the work past the tool is a feed rate motion rather than a cutting speed motion. Planer mills are built to machine very large parts. The worktable and bed of the machine are heavy and relatively low to the ground, and the milling heads are supported by a bridge structure that spans across the table. \rA tracer mill, also called a pro\ufb01 ling mill, is designed to reproduce an irregular part geometry that has been created on a template. Using either manual feed by a human operator or automatic feed by the machine tool, a tracing probe is controlled to follow the template while a milling head duplicates the path taken by the probe to machine the desired shape. Tracer mills are of two types: (1) x\u2013y tracing, in which the contour of a \ufb02at template is pro\ufb01le milled using two-axis control; and (2) x\u2013y\u2013z tracing, in which the probe follows a three dimensional pattern using three-axis control. Tracer mills have been used for creating shapes that cannot easily be generated by a simple feeding action of the work against the milling cutter. Applications include molds and dies. In recent years, many of these applications have been taken over by computer numerical control (CNC) milling machines. \r\r\r\rCNC milling machines are milling machines in which the cutter path is controlled by alphanumerical data rather than a physical template. They are especially suited to pro\ufb01le milling,pocket milling,surfacecontouring,and die sinkingoperations,inwhich two or three axes of the worktable must be simultaneously controlled to achieve the required cutter path.

An operator is normally required to change cutters as well as load and unload work parts. \r\r\rMachining Centers and Turning Centers \rA machining center, illustrated in Figure 21.26, is a highly automated machine tool capable of performing multiple machining operations under computer numerical control in one setup with minimal human attention. Workers are needed to load and unload parts, which usually takes considerable less time than the machine cycle time, so one worker may be able to tend more than one machine. Typical operations performed on a machining center are milling and drilling, which use rotating cutting tools. \rThe typical features that distinguish a machining center from conventional machine tools and make it so productive include: \r\u27a2 \rMultiple operations in one setup.Most work parts require more than one operation to completely machine the speci\ufb01ed geometry. Complex parts may require dozens of separate machining operations, each requiring its own machine tool, setup, and cutting tool. Machining centers are capable of performing most or all of the operations at one location, thus minimizing setup time and production lead time. \r\r\u27a2 \rAutomatic tool changing.To change from one machining operation to the next,the cutting tools must be changed.This is done on a machining center under CNC program control by an automatic tool-changer designed to exchange cutters between the machine tool spindle and a tool storage carousels. Capacities of these carousels \r\r\rFIGURE 21.26 A universal machiningcenter. Capability to orient the workhead makes this a \ufb01ve-axis machine. (Courtesy ofCincinnati Milacron.) \r\rcommonly range from 16 to 80 cutting tools. The machine in Figure 21.26 has two storage carousels on the left side of the column. \r\u27a2 \rPallet shuttles. Some machining centers are equipped with pallet shuttles, which are automatically transferred between the spindle position and the loading station, as shown in Figure 21.26. Parts are \ufb01xtured on pallets that are attached to the shuttles. In this arrangement, the operator can be unloading the previous part and loading the next part while the machine tool is engaged in machining the current part. Nonproductive time on the machine is thereby reduced. \r\r\u27a2 \rAutomatic work part positioning. Many machining centers have more than three axes. One of the additional axes is often designed as a rotary table to position the part at some speci\ufb01ed angle relative to the spindle.The rotary table permits the cutter to perform machining on four sides of the part in a single setup. \r\r\rMachining centers are classi\ufb01ed as horizontal,vertical,or universal.The designation refers to spindle orientation. Horizontal machining centers (HMCs) normally machine cube-shaped parts, in which the four vertical sides of the cube can be accessed by the cutter. Vertical machining centers (VMCs) are suited to \ufb02at parts on which the tool can machine the top surface. Universal machining centers have workheads that swivel their spindle axes to any angle between horizontal and vertical, as in Figure 21.26. \rSuccess of CNC machining centers led to the development of CNC turning centers.A modern CNC turning center, Figure 21.27, is capable of performing various turning and related operations,contour turning,and automatic tool indexing,all under computer control.In addition,the most sophisticated turning centers can accomplish (1) work part gaging (checking key dimensions after machining), (2) tool monitoring (sensors to indicate \r\r\r\r(b) sequence of operations on a mill-turn center: (1) turn second diameter, (2) mill \ufb02at with part in programmed angular position, (3) drill hole with part in same programmed position, and (4) cutoff. \rwhen the tools are worn), (3) automatic tool changing when tools become worn, and even (4) automatic work part changing at the completion of the work cycle [14]. \rAnother type of machine tool related to machining centers and turning centers is the CNC mill-turn center.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 49323, "end_char_idx": 53646, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fb844d3-e4f3-46cd-96be-efd12fbd6829": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fb844d3-e4f3-46cd-96be-efd12fbd6829", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "29019680-cab8-467e-b66a-c28774bb619b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "5459d1faf2d886a349261f219b240526c29017f0c9a873b4d51caea29e409009", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "018e4a55-3f54-4400-a229-57144af9899d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "65fffe959a0865a3f76de0fab7f5114689c85e1f9d567f984cc5c7087814cbd7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ff7a6f18-8a51-47d2-a6d3-b3d278c69f9a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b60c1fd30ffce564fdeb3de0650e39858d2998d6112b8a86ad58f69cd55e7a31", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Success of CNC machining centers led to the development of CNC turning centers.A modern CNC turning center, Figure 21.27, is capable of performing various turning and related operations,contour turning,and automatic tool indexing,all under computer control.In addition,the most sophisticated turning centers can accomplish (1) work part gaging (checking key dimensions after machining), (2) tool monitoring (sensors to indicate \r\r\r\r(b) sequence of operations on a mill-turn center: (1) turn second diameter, (2) mill \ufb02at with part in programmed angular position, (3) drill hole with part in same programmed position, and (4) cutoff. \rwhen the tools are worn), (3) automatic tool changing when tools become worn, and even (4) automatic work part changing at the completion of the work cycle [14]. \rAnother type of machine tool related to machining centers and turning centers is the CNC mill-turn center. This machine has the general con\ufb01guration of a turning center; in addition, it can position a cylindrical work part at a speci\ufb01ed angle so that a rotating cutting tool (e.g., milling cutter) can machine features into the outside surface of the part,as illustrated in Figure 21.28.An ordinary turning center does not have the capability to stop the work part at a de\ufb01ned angular position, and it does not possess rotating tool spindles. \rFurther progress in machine tool technology has taken the mill-turn center one step further by integrating additional capabilities into a single machine. The additional capabilities include (1) combining milling, drilling, and turning with grinding, welding, and inspection operations, all in one machine tool; (2) using multiple spindles simultaneously, either on a single workpiece or two different workpieces; and (3) automating the part handling function by adding industrial robots to the machine [2], [20]. The terms multitasking machine and multifunction machine are sometimes used for these machine tools. \r\rOther Machining Operations In addition to turning, drilling, and milling,several other machining operations should be included in this survey: (1) shaping and planing, (2) broaching, and (3) sawing.  \r21.6.1  SHAPING AND PLANING  \r\rShaping and planing are similar operations, both involving the use of a single-point cutting tool moved linearly relative to the work part. In conventional shaping and \r\rSpeed motion(linear, tool) \r\r\rFeed motion Feed motion \r(intermittent, tool) \r\rNew surface (intermittent, work) \rNew surface \r\rWorkpart  Speed motion(linear, work)  Workpart  \r(a) Shaping  (b) Planing  \rFIGURE 21.29  (a) Shaping, and (b) planing.  \r\rplaning, a straight, \ufb02at surface is created by this action. The difference between the two operations is illustrated in Figure 21.29. In shaping, the speed motion is accomplished by moving the cutting tool; while in planing, the speed motion is accomplished by moving the work part. \rCutting tools used in shaping and planing are single-point tools. Unlike turning, interrupted cutting occurs in shaping and planing, subjecting the tool to an impact loading upon entry into the work. In addition, these machine tools are limited to low speeds due to their start-and-stop motion. The conditions normally dictate use of high-speed steel cutting tools. \rShaping Shaping is performed on a machine tool called a shaper, Figure 21.30. The components of the shaper include a ram, which moves relative to a column to provide the cutting motion, and a worktable that holds the part and accomplishes the feed motion. The motion of the ram consists of a forward stroke to achieve the cut, and a return stroke during which the tool is lifted slightly to clear the work and then reset for the next pass. On completion of each return stroke, the worktable is advanced laterally relative to the ram trajectory to feed the part. Feed is speci\ufb01ed in mm/stroke (in/stroke). The drive mechanism for the ram can be either hydraulic \rFIGURE 21.30 Componentsof a shaper. \r\r\r\r(a) \rV-groove, (b) square groove, (c) T-slot, \r\r(d) \rdovetail slot, and \r\r(e)\r gear teeth. \r\r\rFIGURE 21.31 \rOpen side planer. \ror mechanical.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 52743, "end_char_idx": 56845, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff7a6f18-8a51-47d2-a6d3-b3d278c69f9a": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff7a6f18-8a51-47d2-a6d3-b3d278c69f9a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "29019680-cab8-467e-b66a-c28774bb619b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "5459d1faf2d886a349261f219b240526c29017f0c9a873b4d51caea29e409009", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3fb844d3-e4f3-46cd-96be-efd12fbd6829", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "3d49515f8dd03226c515b6850ffd415904525d599d3610f4cd4205854a4517ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aaffb0c6-68fd-4165-8e2c-4cc0e70f3770", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eda32548c9e4178679012422d4c7da875306ee68b0e1ddbf32937ae0d6407fe8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The motion of the ram consists of a forward stroke to achieve the cut, and a return stroke during which the tool is lifted slightly to clear the work and then reset for the next pass.

Hydraulic drive has greater \ufb02exibility in adjusting the stroke length and a more uniform speed during the forward stroke, but it is more expensive than a mechanical drive unit. Both mechanical and hydraulic drives are designed to achieve higher speeds on the return (noncutting) stroke than on the forward (cutting) stroke, thereby increasing the proportion of time spent cutting. \rPlaning The machine tool for planing is a planer. Cutting speed is achieved by a reciprocating worktable that moves the part past the single point cutting tool.The construction and motion capability of a planer permit much larger parts to be machined than on a shaper. Planers can be classi\ufb01ed as open side planers or double-column planers.The open-side planer, also known as a single-column planer, Figure 21.31, has a single column supporting the cross-rail on which a toolhead is mounted. Another toolhead can also be mounted and fed along the vertical column. Multiple toolheads permit more than one cut to be taken on each pass. At the completion of each stroke, each toolhead is moved relative to the cross-rail (or column) to achieve the intermittent feed motion. The con\ufb01guration of the open-side planer permits very wide work parts to be machined. \rA double-column planer has two columns, one on either side of the base and worktable. The columns support the cross-rail, on which one or more toolheads are mounted.The two columns provide a more rigid structure for the operation;however, the two columns limit the width of the work that can be handled on this machine. \rShaping and planing can be used to machine shapes other than \ufb02 at surfaces. The restriction is that the cut surface must be straight. This allows the cutting of grooves, slots, gear teeth, and other shapes as illustrated in Figure 21.32. Special machines and tool geometries must be speci\ufb01ed to cut some of these shapes.An important example is the gear shaper, a vertical shaper with a specially designed rotary feed table and synchronized tool head used to generate teeth on spur gears. Gear shaping and other methods of producing gears are discussed inSection 21.7.2. \r\r\r21.6.2 BROACHING \rBroaching is performed using a multiple teeth cutting tool by moving the tool linearly relative to the work in the direction of the tool axis, as in Figure 21.33. The machine tool is called a broaching machine, and the cutting tool is called a broach. Aspects of broach geometry are discussed in Section 22.3.2. In certain jobs for which broaching can be used, it is a highly productive method of machining. Advantages include good surface \ufb01nish, close tolerances, and a variety of work shapes. Owing to the complicated and often custom-shaped geometry of the broach, tooling is expensive. \rThere are two principal types of broaching: external (also called surface broaching) and internal. External broaching is performed on the outside surface of the work to create a certain cross-sectional shape on the surface.

External broaching is performed on the outside surface of the work to create a certain cross-sectional shape on the surface. Figure 21.34(a) shows some possible cross sections that can be formed by external broaching. Internal broaching is accomplished on the internal surface of a hole in the part. Accordingly, a starting hole must be present in the part so as to insert the broach at the beginning of the broaching stroke.

Most broaching machines can be classi\ufb01 ed as either vertical or horizontal machines. The vertical broaching machine is designed to move the broach along a vertical path, while the horizontal broaching machine has a horizontal tool path. Most broaching machines pull the broach past the work. However, there are exceptions to this pull action. One exception is a relatively simple type called a broaching press, used only for internal broaching, that pushes the tool through the work part. Another exception is the continuous broaching machine, in which the work parts are \ufb01xtured to an endless belt loop and moved past a stationary broach. Because of its continuous operation, this machine can be used only for surface broaching. \r\r21.6.3 SAWING \rSawing is a process in which a narrow slit is cut into the work by a tool consisting of a series of narrowly spaced teeth. Sawing is normally used to separate a work part into two pieces, or to cut off an unwanted portion of a part. These operations are often referred to as cutoff operations. Since many factories require cutoff operations at some point in the production sequence, sawing is an important manufacturing process. \rIn most sawing operations, the work is held stationary and the saw blade is moved relative to it. Saw blade tooth geometry is discussed in Section 22.3.2. There are three basic types of sawing, as in Figure 21.35, according to the type of blade motion involved: (a) hacksawing, (b) bandsawing, and (c) circular sawing. \rHacksawing, Figure 21.35(a), involves a linear reciprocating motion of the saw against the work. This method of sawing is often used in cutoff operations. Cutting is accomplished only on the forward stroke of the saw blade. Because of this intermittent cutting action, hacksawing is inherently less ef\ufb01cient than the other sawing methods, both of which are continuous. The hacksaw blade is a thin straight tool with cutting teeth on one edge. Hacksawing can be done either manually or with a power hacksaw. A power hacksaw provides a drive mechanism to operate the saw blade at a desired speed; it also applies a given feed rate or sawing pressure. \rBandsawing involves a linear continuous motion, using a bandsaw blade made in the form of an endless \ufb02 exible loop with teeth on one edge. The sawing machine is a bandsaw, which provides a pulley-like drive mechanism to continuously move and guide the bandsaw blade past the work. Bandsaws are classi\ufb01 ed as vertical or horizontal.The designation refers to the direction of saw blade motion during cutting. Vertical bandsaws are used for cutoff as well as other operations such as contouring and slotting. Contouring on a bandsaw involves cutting a part pro\ufb01 le from \ufb02 at stock. Slotting is the cutting of a thin slot into a part, an operation for which bandsawing is well suited. Contour sawing and slotting are operations in which the work is fed into the saw blade. \rVertical bandsaw machines can be operated either manually, in which the operator guides and feeds the work past the bandsaw blade, or automatically, in which the work is power fed past the blade. Recent innovations in bandsaw design have permitted the use of CNC to perform contouring of complex outlines.

Circular sawing is often used to cut long bars, tubes, and similar shapes to speci\ufb01 ed length. The cutting action is similar to a slot milling operation, except that the saw blade is thinner and contains many more cutting teeth than a slot milling cutter. Circular sawing machines have powered spindles to rotate the saw blade and a feeding mechanism to drive the rotating blade into the work. \rTwo operations related to circular sawing are abrasive cutoff and friction sawing. In abrasive cutoff, an abrasive disk is used to perform cutoff operations on hard materials that would be dif\ufb01cult to saw with a conventional saw blade. In friction sawing, a steel disk is rotated against the work at very high speeds, resulting in friction heat that causes the material to soften suf\ufb01 ciently to permit penetration of the disk through the work.The cutting speeds in both of these operations are much faster than in circular sawing. \r\r\r\r\rMachining Operations for Special Geometries \rOne of the reasons for the technological importance of machining is its capability to produce unique geometric features such as screw threads and gear teeth.This section discusses the cutting processes that are used to accomplish these shapes, most of which are adaptations of machining operations discussed earlier in the chapter. \r\r21.7.1 SCREW THREADS \rThreaded hardware components are widely used as fasteners in assembly (screws, bolts, and nuts, Section 31.1) and for transmission of motion in machinery (e.g., lead screws in positioning systems, Section 37.3.2). Threads can be de\ufb01 ned as grooves that form a spiral around the outside of a cylinder (external threads) or the inside of a round hole (internal threads). Thread rolling (Section 18.2) is by far the most common method for producing external threads, but the process is not economical for low production quantities and the work metal must be ductile. Metallic threaded components can also be made by casting, especially investment casting and die casting (Sections 11.2.4 and 11.3.3), and plastic parts with threads can be injection molded (Section 13.6). Finally, threaded components can be machined, and this is the topic addressed here. The discussion is organized into external and internal thread machining. \r\rExternal Threads The simplest and most versatile method of cutting an external thread on a cylindrical work part is single-point threading, which employs a single-point cutting tool on a lathe. This process is illustrated in Figure 21.6(g). The starting diameter of the workpiece is equal to the major diameter of the screw thread. The tool must have the pro\ufb01 le of the thread groove, and the lathe must be capable of maintaining the same relationship between the tool and the workpiece on successive passes in order to cut a consistent spiral.This relationship is achieved by means of the lathe\u2019s lead screw (see Figure 21.7). More than one turning pass is usually required. The \ufb01 rst pass takes a light cut; the tool is then retracted and rapidly traversed back to the starting point; and each ensuing pass traces the same spiral using ever greater depths of cut until the desired form of the thread groove has been established. Single-point threading is suitable for low or even medium production quantities, but less time-consuming methods are more economical for high production. \rAn alternative to using a single-point tool is a threading die, shown in Figure 21.36.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 62939, "end_char_idx": 67423, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8352301a-3864-45b0-aba2-c623738e5928": {"__data__": {"id_": "8352301a-3864-45b0-aba2-c623738e5928", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "29019680-cab8-467e-b66a-c28774bb619b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "5459d1faf2d886a349261f219b240526c29017f0c9a873b4d51caea29e409009", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "98cb98e7-c4ae-4967-8780-735d214461e3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "0528e401719fb88c0db847b0242bf2abb6851715405cad094191e2fde5d53995", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "36717092-645b-43d4-92fc-fedb619dde18", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "824d29a19c33720a4045882219f588ac408f55965b9b75502fb5a04d70496b60", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The starting diameter of the workpiece is equal to the major diameter of the screw thread.

Single-point threading is suitable for low or even medium production quantities, but less time-consuming methods are more economical for high production. \rAn alternative to using a single-point tool is a threading die, shown in Figure 21.36. To cut an external thread, the die is rotated around the starting cylindrical stock of the proper diameter, beginning at one end and proceeding to the other end. The cutting teeth at the opening of the die are tapered so that the starting depth of cut is less at the beginning of the operation, \ufb01nally reaching full thread depth at the trailing side of the die.The pitch of the threading die teeth determines the pitch of the screw that is being cut.The die in Figure 21.36 has a slit that allows the size of the opening to be adjusted to compensate for tool wear on the teeth or to provide for minor differences in screw size. Threading dies cut the threads in a single pass rather than multiple passes as in single-point threading. \rThreading dies are typically used in manual operations, in which the die is \ufb01 xed in a holder that can be rotated by hand. If the workpiece has a head or other obstacle at the other end, the die must be unwound from the screw just created in order to remove it. This is not only time consuming, but it also risks possible damage to the thread surfaces. In mechanized threading operations, cycle times can be reduced by using self-opening threading dies, which are designed with an automatic device that opens the cutting teeth at the end of each cut.This eliminates the need to unwind the die from the work and avoids possible damage to the threads. Self-opening dies are equipped with four sets of cutting teeth, similar to the threading die in Figure 21.36, except that the teeth can be adjusted and removed for resharpening, and the tool-holder mechanism possesses the self-opening feature. Different sets of cutting teeth are required for different thread sizes. \r\rThe term thread chasing is often applied to production operations that utilize self-opening dies.Two types of thread chasing equipment are available:(1) stationary self-opening dies, in which the workpiece rotates and the die does not, like a turning operation; and (2) revolving self-opening dies, in which the die rotates and the workpiece does not, like a drilling operation. \rTwo additional external threading operations should be mentioned: thread milling and thread grinding. Thread milling involves the use of a milling cutter to shape the threads of a screw. One possible setup is illustrated in Figure 21.37. In this operation a form-milling cutter, whose pro\ufb01le is that of the thread groove, is oriented at an angle equal to the helix angle of the thread and fed longitudinally as the workpiece is slowly rotated. In a variation of this operation, a multiple-form cutter is used, so that multiple screw threads can be cut simultaneously to increase production rates. Possible reasons for preferring thread milling over thread chasing include (1) the size of the thread is too large to be readily cut with a die and (2) thread milling is generally noted to produce more accurate and smoother threads. \rThread grinding is similar to thread milling except the cutter is a grinding wheel with the shape of the thread groove, and the rotational speed of the grinding wheel is much greater than in milling. The process can be used to completely form the threads or to \ufb01nish threads that have been formed by one of the previously discussed processes.Thread grinding is especially applicable for threads that have been hardened by heat treatment. \r\r\rInternal Threads The most common process for cutting internal threads is tapping, in which a cylindrical tool with cutting teeth arranged in a spiral whose pitch is equal to that of the screw threads, is simultaneously rotated and fed into a pre-existing hole. The operation is illustrated in Figure 21.14(b), and the cutting tool is called a tap. The end of the tool is slightly conical to facilitate entry into the hole.

The operation is illustrated in Figure 21.14(b), and the cutting tool is called a tap. The end of the tool is slightly conical to facilitate entry into the hole. The initial hole size is approximately equal to the minor diameter of the screw thread. In the simplest version of the process, the tap is a solid piece and the tapping operation is performed on a drill press equipped with a tapping head, which allows penetration into the hole at a rate that corresponds to the screw pitch.At the end of the operation,the spindle rotation is reversed so the tap can be unscrewed from the hole. \rIn addition to solid taps, collapsible taps are available, just as self-opening dies are available for external threading. Collapsible taps have cutting teeth that automatically retract into the tool when the thread has been cut, allowing it to be quickly removed from the tapped hole without reversing spindle direction. Thus, shorter cycle times are possible. \rAlthough production tapping can be accomplished on drill presses and other conventional machine tools (e.g., lathes, turret lathes), several types of specialized machines have been developed for higher production rates. Single-spindle tapping machines perform tapping one workpiece at a time, with manual or automatic loading and unloading of the starting blanks. Multiple-spindle tapping machines operate on multiple work parts simultaneously and provide for different hole sizes and screw pitches to be accomplished together. Finally gang drills (Section 21.3.3) can be set up to perform drilling, reaming, and tapping in rapid sequence on the same part. \r\r21.7.2 GEARS \rGears are machinery components used to transmit motion and power between rotat ing shafts. As illustrated in Figure 21.38, the transmission of rotational motion is achieved between meshing gears by teeth located around their respective circumferences. The teeth have a special curved shape called an involute, which minimizes friction and wear between contacting teeth of meshing gears. Depending on the relative numbers of teeth of the two gears, the speed of rotation can be increased or decreased from one gear to the next, with a corresponding decrease or increase in torque. These speed effects are examined in Section 37.3.2 on numerical control positioning systems. \rThere are various gear types, the most basic and least complicated to produce is the spur gear represented in Figure 21.38. It has teeth that are parallel to the axis of the gear\u2019s rotation. A gear with teeth that form an angle relative to the axis of rotation is called a helical gear. The helical tooth design allows more than one tooth to be in contact for smoother operation. Spur and helical gears provide rotation between shafts whose axes are parallel. Other types, such as bevel gears, provide motion between shafts that are at an angle with each other, usually 90. A rack is a straight gear (a gear of in\ufb01nite radius), which allows rotational motion to be converted into linear motion (e.g., rack-and-pinion steering on automobiles). The variety of gear types is far too great for us to discuss them all, and the interested reader is referred to texts on machine design for coverage of gear design and mechanics.This section is concerned with the manufacture of gears. \r\rSeveral of the shape processing operations discussed in previous chapters can be used to produce gears. These include investment casting, die casting, plastic injection molding, powder metallurgy, forging, and other bulk deformation operations (e.g., gear rolling, Section 18.2). The advantage of these operations over machining is material savings because no chips are produced.

These include investment casting, die casting, plastic injection molding, powder metallurgy, forging, and other bulk deformation operations (e.g., gear rolling, Section 18.2). The advantage of these operations over machining is material savings because no chips are produced. Sheet metal stamping operations (Section 19.1) are used to produce thin gears in watches and clocks.The gears produced by all of the preceding operations can often be used without further processing. In other cases, a basic shape processing operation such as casting or forging is used to produce a starting metal blank, and these parts are then machined to form the gear teeth. Finishing operations are often required to achieve the speci\ufb01ed accuracies of the teeth dimensions. \rThe principal machining operations used to cut gear teeth are form milling, gear hobbing, gear shaping, and gear broaching. Form milling and gear broaching are considered to be forming operations in the sense of Section 21.1, while gear hobbing and gear shaping are classi\ufb01ed as generating operations. Finishing processes for gear teeth include gear shaving, gear grinding, and burnishing. Many of the processes used to make gears are also used to produce splines, sprockets, and other special machinery components. \rForm Milling In this process, illustrated in Figure 21.39, the teeth on a gear blank are machined individually by a form-milling cutter whose cutting edges have the shape of the spaces between the teeth on the gear. The machining operation is classi\ufb01ed as forming (Section 21.1) because the shape of the cutter determines the geometry of the gear teeth. The disadvantage of form milling is that production rates are slow because each tooth space is created one at a time and the gear blank must be indexed between each pass to establish the correct size of the gear tooth, which also takes time. The advantage of form milling over gear hobbing (discussed next) is that the milling cutter is much less expensive. The slow production rates and relatively low cost tooling make form milling appropriate for low production quantities. \r\r\rGear Hobbing Gear hobbing is also a milling operation, but the cutter, called a hob, is much more complex and therefore much more expensive than a form milling cutter. In addition, special milling machines (called hobbing machines) are required to accomplish the relative speed and feed motions between the cutter and the gear blank.Gear hobbing is illustrated in Figure 21.40.As shown inthe \ufb01gure,the hob has a slight helix and its rotation must be coordinated with the much slower rotation of the gear blank in order for the hob\u2019s cutting teeth to mesh with the blank\u2019s teeth as they are being cut.This is accomplished for a spur gear by offsetting the axis of rotation of the hob by an amount equal to 90% less the helix angle relative to the axis of the gear blank. In addition to these rotary motions of the hob and the workpiece, a straight-line motion is also required to feed the hob relative to the gear blank throughout its thickness. Several teeth are cut simultaneously in hobbing, which allows for higher production rates than form milling. Accordingly, it is a widely used gear making process for medium and high production quantities. \rGear Shaping In gear shaping, a reciprocating cutting tool motion is used rather than a rotational motion as in form milling and gear hobbing. Two quite different forms of shaping operation (Section 21.6.1) are used to produce gears. In the \ufb01 rst type, a single-point tool takes multiple passes to gradually shape each tooth pro\ufb01le using \rHob \rCutting edges Gear blank \rWorkpiecerotation (slow) \rWork feed \rCutter rotation\rFIGURE 21.40 \rGear hobbing. \rcomputerized controls or a template. The gear blank is slowly rotated or indexed, with the same pro\ufb01 le being imparted to each tooth.

The axes of the cutter and the gear blank are parallel, as illustrated in Figure 21.41, and the action is similar to a pair of conjugate gears except that the reciprocation of the cutter is gradually creating the form of the matching teeth in its mating component. At the beginning of the operation for a given gear blank, the cutter is fed into the blank after each stroke until the required depth has been reached.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 74322, "end_char_idx": 78888, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9add55e3-bc34-4279-ae79-757db08092fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "9add55e3-bc34-4279-ae79-757db08092fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "29019680-cab8-467e-b66a-c28774bb619b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "5459d1faf2d886a349261f219b240526c29017f0c9a873b4d51caea29e409009", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d8b7ea5e-534d-43a1-bca2-031ca9ab055f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "2fd37845575e4ce82d47c17eafec9ce67d5b9a95bb7aa78529daf4ed0a29dbaa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e7fc6c22-4836-4c8d-b2c4-4e7b37bfa221", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "00a3a86a85828a4427102ebd9e383acbf7f4c47ea4553403eaac3c865c4df528", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "computerized controls or a template.

At the beginning of the operation for a given gear blank, the cutter is fed into the blank after each stroke until the required depth has been reached. Then, after each successive pass of the tool, both the cutter and the blank are rotated a small amount (indexed) so as to maintain the same tooth spacing on each. Gear shaping by this second method is widely used in industry, and specialized machines (called gear shapers) are available to accomplish the process. \rGear Broaching Broaching (Section 21.6.2) as a gear making process is noted for short production cycle times and high tooling cost. It is therefore economical only for high volumes. Good dimensional accuracy and \ufb01 ne surface \ufb01 nish are also features of gear broaching. The process can be applied for both external gears (the conventional gear) and internal gears (teeth on the inside of the gear). For making internal gears, the operation is similar to that shown in Figure 21.3(c), except the cross section of the tool consists of a series of gear-shaped cutting teeth of increasing size to form the gear \r\rFIGURE 21.41 Gear shaping. \r\rteeth in successive steps as the broach is drawn through the work blank. To produce external gears,the broach is tubular with inward-facing teeth.As mentioned,the cost of tooling in both cases is high due to the complex geometry. \rFinishing Operations Some metal gears can be used without heat treatment, while those used in more demanding applications are usually heat treated to harden the teeth for maximum wear resistance. Unfortunately, heat treatment (Chapter 26) often results in warpage of the workpiece, and the proper gear-tooth shape must be restored. Whether heat treated or not, some type of \ufb01nishing operation is generally required to improve dimensional accuracy and surface \ufb01nish of the gear after machining. Finishing processes applied to gears that have not been heat treated include shaving and burnishing. Finishing processes applied to hardened gears include grinding, lapping, and honing (Chapter 24). \rGear shaving involves the use of a gear-shaped cutter that is meshed and rotated with the gear. Cutting action results from reciprocation of the cutter during rotation. Each tooth of the gear-shaped cutter has multiple cutting edges along its width, producing very small chips and removing very little metal from the surface of each gear tooth. Gear shaping is probably the most common industrial process for \ufb01nishing gears. It is often applied to a gear prior to heat treatment, and then followed by grinding and/or lapping after heat treatment. \rGear burnishing is a plastic deformation process in which one or more hardened gear-shaped dies are rolled in contact with the gear, and pressure is applied by the dies to effect cold working of the gear teeth.Thus,the teeth are strengthened through strain hardening, and surface \ufb01nish is improved. \rGrinding, honing, and lapping are three \ufb01nishing processes that can be used on hardened gears. Gear grinding can be based on either of two methods. The \ufb01rst is form grinding, in which the grinding wheel has the exact shape of the tooth spacing (similar to form milling), and a grinding pass or series of passes are made to \ufb01nish form each tooth in the gear. The other method involves generating the tooth pro\ufb01le using a conventional straight-sided grinding wheel. Both of these grinding methods are very time consuming and expensive. \rHoning and lapping, discussed in Section 24.2.1 and 24.2.2, respectively, are two \ufb01 nishing processes that can be adapted to gear \ufb01 nishing using very \ufb01 ne abrasives.The tools in both processes usually possess the geometry of a gear that meshes with the gear to be processed. Gear honing uses a tool that is made of either plastic impregnated with abrasives or steel coated with carbide.

In its simplest de\ufb01 nition, high-speed machining (HSM) means using cutting speeds that are signi\ufb01cantly higher than those used in conventional machining operations. Some examples of cutting speed values for conventional and HSM are presented in Table 21.1, according to data compiled by Kennametal Inc.1 \rOther de\ufb01nitions of HSM have been developed to deal with the wide variety of work materials and tool materials used in machining. One popular HSM de\ufb01nition is the DN ratio\u2014the bearing bore diameter (mm) multiplied by the maximum spindle speed (rev/min). For high-speed machining, the typical DN ratio is between 500,000 and 1,000,000.This de\ufb01nition allows larger diameter bearings to fall within the HSM range, even though they operate at lower rotational speeds than smaller bearings. \r\rTABLE \u2022 21.1 Comparison of cutting speeds used in conventional versus high-speed machining for selectedwork materials. \r\r\r\rSolid Tools (end mills, drills)a Indexable Tools (face mills)a Conventional Speed High Cutting Speed Conventional Speed High Cutting Speed Work Material m/min ft/min m/min ft/min m/min ft/min m/min ft/min \rAluminum 300$ 1000$ 3000$ 10,000$ 600$ 2000$ 3600$ 12,000$ Cast iron, soft 150 500 360 1200 360 1200 1200 4000 Cast iron, ductile 105 350 250 800 250 800 900 3000 Steel, free machining 105 350 360 1200 360 1200 600 2000 Steel, alloy 75 250 250 800 210 700 360 1200 Titanium 40 125 60 200 45 150 90 \r300 \r\rSource: Kennametal Inc.

Appropriate tool materials include cemented carbide and coated carbide of various grades for all materials, ceramics for all materials, polycrystalline diamond tools for aluminum, and cubic boron nitride for steels (see Section 22.2 for discussion of these tool materials). \r1Kennametal Inc. is a leading producer of cutting tools. \r\rTypical HSM spindle velocities range between 8000 and 35,000 rpm, although some spindles today are designed to rotate at 100,000 rpm. \rAnother HSM de\ufb01nition is based on the ratio of horsepower to maximum spindle speed, or hp/rpm ratio. Conventional machine tools usually have a higher hp/rpm ratio than machines equipped for high-speed machining. By this metric, the dividing line between conventional machining and HSM is around 0.005 hp/rpm. Thus, high-speed machining includes 50 hp spindles capable of 10,000 rpm (0.005 hp/rpm) and 15 hp spindles that can rotate at 30,000 rpm (0.0005 hp/rpm). \rOther de\ufb01nitions emphasize higher production rates and shorter lead times, rather than functions of spindle speed. In this case, important noncutting factors come into play, such as high rapid traverse speeds and quick automatic tool changes (\u201cchip-to-chip\u201d times of 7 s and less).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 81972, "end_char_idx": 85767, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c037e396-fda8-48eb-8595-9410388c5c05": {"__data__": {"id_": "c037e396-fda8-48eb-8595-9410388c5c05", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "29019680-cab8-467e-b66a-c28774bb619b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "5459d1faf2d886a349261f219b240526c29017f0c9a873b4d51caea29e409009", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7fc6c22-4836-4c8d-b2c4-4e7b37bfa221", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec21.txt", "file_name": "sec21.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 88896, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "08d3492ea0de61664c35199d4c0818f5727cfac73ed756d1941d4eb8ddd99e85", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Another HSM de\ufb01nition is based on the ratio of horsepower to maximum spindle speed, or hp/rpm ratio.

Also important are the cutting tool materials. As listed in Table 21.1, various tool materials are used for high-speed machining, and these materials are discussed in the following chapter. \r\r\rApplications of HSM seem to divide into three categories [3]. One is in the aircraft industry, by companies such as Boeing, in which long airframe structural components are machined from large aluminum blocks. Much metal removal is required, mostly by milling. The resulting pieces are characterized by thin walls and large surface-to-volume ratios, but they can be produced more quickly and are more reliable than assemblies involving multiple components and riveted joints.A second category involves the machining of aluminum by multiple operations to produce a variety of components for industries such as automotive, computer, and medical. Multiple cutting operations mean many tool changes as well as many accelerations and decelerations of the tooling. Thus, quick tool changes and tool path control are important in these applications. The third application category for HSM is in the die and mold industry, which fabricates complex geometries from hard materials. In this case, high-speed machining involves much metal removal to create the mold or die cavity and \ufb01nishing operations to achieve \ufb01ne surface \ufb01nishes. \r\r[1]  Aronson, R.

The high forces and temperatures during machining create a very harsh environment for the tool. If cutting force becomes too high, the tool fractures. If cutting temperature becomes too high, the tool material softens and fails. If neither of these conditions causes the tool to fail, continual wear of the cutting edge ultimately leads to failure. \rCutting tool technology has two principal aspects: tool material and tool geometry. The \ufb01rst is concerned with developing materials that can withstand the forces, temperatures, and wearing action in the machining process.The second deals with optimizing the geometry of the cutting tool for the tool material and for a given operation. It is appropriate to begin by considering tool life, because this is a prerequisite for much of the subsequent discussion on tool materials. It also seems appropriate to include a section on cutting \ufb02uids at the end of this chapter; cutting \ufb02uids are often used in machining operations to prolong the life of a cutting tool. \r\r\r\r\r\rTool Life \rAs suggested by the opening paragraph, there are three possible modes by which a cutting tool can fail in machining: \r1. \rFracture failure. This mode of failure occurs when the cutting force at the tool point becomes excessive, causing it to fail suddenly by brittle fracture. \r\r2. \rTemperature failure. This failure occurs when the cutting temperature is too high for the tool material, causing the material at the tool point to soften, which leads to plastic deformation and loss of the sharp edge. \r\r3. \rGradual wear. Gradual wearing of the cutting edge causes loss of tool shape, reduction in cutting ef\ufb01ciency, an acceleration of wearing as the tool becomes heavily worn, and \ufb01nally tool failure in a manner similar to a temperature failure. \r\r\r\rFracture and temperature failures result in premature loss of the cutting tool. These two modes of failure are therefore undesirable. Of the three possible tool failures, gradual wear is preferred because it leads to the longest possible use of the tool, with the associated economic advantage of that longer use. \rProduct quality must also be considered when attempting to control the mode of tool failure. When the tool point fails suddenly during a cut, it often causes damage to the work surface. This damage requires either rework of the surface or possible scrapping of the part. The damage can be avoided by selecting cutting conditions that favor gradual wearing of the tool rather than fracture or temperature failure, and by changing the tool before the \ufb01nal catastrophic loss of the cutting edge occurs. \r\r22.1.1 TOOL WEAR \r,Figure22.2(b),occursonthe\ufb02ank,orrelief wearFlank . eitherbyitsdepthoritsarea \rGradual wear occurs at two principal locations on a cutting tool: the top rake face and the \ufb02ank.

It results from rubbing between the newly generated work surface and the \ufb02ank face adjacent to the cutting edge. Flank wear is measured by the width of the wear band, FW. This wear band is sometimes called the \ufb02 ank wear land. \rCertain features of \ufb02ank wear can be identi\ufb01ed. First, an extreme condition of \ufb02ank wear often appears on the cutting edge at the location corresponding to the original surface of the work part. This is called notch wear. It occurs because the original work surface is harder and/or more abrasive than the internal material, which could be caused by work hardening from cold drawing or previous machining, sand particles in the surface from casting, or other reasons. As a consequence of the harder surface, wear is accelerated at this location. A second region of \ufb02ank wear that can be identi\ufb01ed is nose radius wear; this occurs on the nose radius leading into the end cutting edge. \r\rFIGURE 22.1 Diagramof worn cutting tool,showing the principallocations and types ofwear that occur. \r\r\r(a) \r\r\r(b) \r\rFIGURE 22.2 (a) Crater wear and (b) \ufb02ank wear on a cemented carbide tool, as seen through a toolmaker\u2019s microscope. (Courtesy of George E. Kane Manufacturing Technology Laboratory, Lehigh University; photos by \rJ. C. Keefe.) \rThe mechanisms that cause wear at the tool\u2013chip and tool\u2013work interfaces in machining can be summarized as follows: \r\u27a2 \rAbrasion.This is a mechanical wearing action caused by hard particles in the work material gouging and removing small portions of the tool. This abrasive action  occurs in both \ufb02ank wear and crater wear; it is a signi\ufb01cant cause of \ufb02 ank wear. \r\r\u27a2 \rAdhesion. When two metals are forced into contact under high pressure and temperature, adhesion (welding) occurs between them. These conditions are present between the chip and the rake face of the tool. As the chip \ufb02ows across \r\r\rthe tool, small particles of the tool adhere to the chip and are broken away from the surface, resulting in attrition of the surface. \r\u27a2 \rDiffusion. This is a process in which an exchange of atoms takes place across a close contact boundary between two materials (Section 4.3). In the case of tool wear, diffusion occurs at the tool\u2013chip boundary, causing the tool surface to become depleted of the atoms responsible for its hardness. As this process continues, the tool surface becomes more susceptible to abrasion and adhesion. Diffusion is believed to be a principal mechanism of crater wear. \r\r\u27a2 \rChemical reactions. The high temperatures and clean surfaces at the tool\u2013chip interface in machining at high speeds can result in chemical reactions, in particular, oxidation, on the rake face of the tool. The oxidized layer, being softer than the parent tool material, is sheared away, exposing new material to sustain the reaction process. \r\r\u27a2 \rPlastic deformation. Another mechanism that contributes to tool wear is plastic deformation of the cutting edge. The cutting forces acting on the cutting edge at high temperature cause the edge to deform plastically, making it more vulnerable to abrasion of the tool surface.Plastic deformation contributes mainly to \ufb02 ank wear. \r\r\rMost of these tool-wear mechanisms are accelerated at higher cutting speeds and temperatures. Diffusion and chemical reaction are especially sensitive to elevated temperature. \r\r\r22.1.2 TOOL LIFE AND THE TAYLOR TOOL LIFE EQUATION \rAs cutting proceeds, the various wear mechanisms result in increasing levels of wear on the cutting tool. The general relationship of tool wear versus cutting time is shown in Figure 22.3.

The general relationship of tool wear versus cutting time is shown in Figure 22.3. Although the relationship shown is for \ufb02ank wear, a similar relationship occurs for crater wear. Three regions can usually be identi\ufb01ed in the typical wear growth curve. The \ufb01rst is the break-in period, in which the sharp cutting edge wears rapidly at the beginning of its use. This \ufb01rst region occurs within the \ufb01rst few minutes of cutting. The break-in period is followed by wear that occurs at a fairly uniform rate. This is called the steady-state wear region. In the \ufb01gure, this region is pictured as a linear function of time, although there are deviations from the straight line in actual machining. Finally, wear reaches a level at which the wear rate begins to accelerate. This marks the beginning of the failure region, in which cutting \r\rFIGURE 22.3 Tool wear as a function of cutting time. Flank wear (FW) is usedhere as the measure of tool wear.

If allowed to continue, the tool \ufb01nally fails by temperature failure. \rThe slope of the tool wear curve in the steady-state region is affected by work material and cutting conditions.Harder work materials cause the wear rate (slope of the tool wear curve) to increase. Increased speed, feed, and depth of cut have a similar effect, with speed being the most important of the three. If the tool wear curves are plotted for several different cutting speeds,the results appear as in Figure 22.4.As cutting speed is increased, wear rate increases so the same level of wear is reached in less time. \rTool life is de\ufb01ned as the length of cutting time that the tool can be used. Operating the tool until \ufb01nal catastrophic failure is one way of de\ufb01ning tool life. This is indicated in Figure 22.4 by the end of each tool wear curve. However, in production, it is often a disadvantage to use the tool until this failure occurs because of dif\ufb01culties in resharpening the tool and problems with work surface quality. As an alternative, a level of tool wear can be selected as a criterion of tool life, and the tool is replaced when wear reaches that level.

C (22.1) \r\r1The reader may have noted in Figure 22.5 that the dependent variable (tool life) has been plotted on the horizontal axis and the independent variable (cutting speed) on the vertical axis. Although this is a reversal of the normal plotting convention, it nevertheless is the way the Taylor tool life relationship is usually presented. \r\r400 \r200 \r(1) \rv = 160, T = 5 160 \r\r(2) \rv = 130, T = 12 130 \r\r(3) \rv = 100, T = 41 100 \r\r\r1.0 23 5 10 2030 50 100\r\rlog\u2013log plot of cuttingspeed vs. tool life. Tool life (min) \rCutting speed (m/min) \rwhere v  cutting speed, m/min (ft/min); T  tool life, min; and n and C are parameters whose values depend on feed, depth of cut, work material, tooling (material in particular), and the tool life criterion used. The value of n is relative constant for a given tool material, whereas the value of C depends on tool material, work material, and cutting conditions. \rBasically, Equation (22.1) states that higher cutting speeds result in shorter tool lives. Relating the parameters n and C to Figure 22.5, n is the slope of the plot (expressed in linear terms rather than in the scale of the axes), and C is the intercept on the speed axis. C represents the cutting speed that results in a 1-min tool life. \rThe problem with Equation (22.1) is that the units on the right-hand side of the equation are not consistent with the units on the left-hand side. To make the units consistent, the equation should be expressed in the form \rvTn ! C (Tref n) (22.2) \rwhere Tref ! a reference value for C. Tref is simply 1 min when m/min (ft/min) and minutes are used for v and T, respectively. The advantage of Equation (22.2) is seen when it is desired to use the Taylor equation with units other than m/min (ft/min) and minutes\u2014for example, if cutting speed were expressed as m/sec and tool life as sec. In this case, Tref would be 60 sec and C would therefore be the same speed value as in Equation (22.1), although converted to units of m/sec.

The values of m and p, the exponents for feed and depth, are less than 1.0. This indicates the greater effect of cutting speed on tool life because the exponent of v is 1.0. After speed, feed is next in importance, so m has a value greater than p. The exponent for work hardness, q, is also less than 1.0. \rPerhaps the greatest dif\ufb01culty in applying Equation (22.3) in a practical machining operation is the tremendous amount of machining data that would be required to determine the parameters of the equation. Variations in work materials and testing conditions also cause dif\ufb01culties by introducing statistical variations in the data. Equation (22.3) is valid in indicating general trends among its variables, but not in its ability to accurately predict tool life performance. To reduce these problems and make the scope of the equation more manageable, some of the terms are usually eliminated. For example, omitting depth and hardness reduces Equation (22.3) to the following: \r\rm\rvT n f m ! KTref nfref (22.4) \rwhere the terms have the same meaning as before, except that the constant K will have a slightly different interpretation. \rTool Life Criteria in Production Although \ufb02 ank wear is the tool life criterion in the previous discussion of the Taylor equation, this criterion is not very practical in a factory environment because of the dif\ufb01culties and time required to measure \ufb02 ank wear. Following are nine alternative tool life criteria that are more convenient to use in a production machining operation, some of which are admittedly subjective: \r1. \rComplete failure of the cutting edge (fracture failure, temperature failure, or wearing until complete breakdown of the tool has occurred). This criterion has disadvantages, as discussed earlier. \r\r2. \rVisual inspection of \ufb02ank wear (or crater wear) by the machine operator (without a toolmaker\u2019s microscope). This criterion is limited by the operator\u2019s judgment and ability to observe tool wear with the naked eye. \r\r3. \rFingernail test across the cutting edge by the operator to test for irregularities. \r\r4. \rChanges in the sound emitting from the operation, as judged by the operator. \r\r5. \rChips become ribbony, stringy, and dif\ufb01cult to dispose of. \r\r6. \rDegradation of the surface \ufb01nish on the work. \r\r7. \rIncreased power consumption in the operation, as measured by a wattmeter connected to the machine tool. \r\r8. \rWorkpiece count.

To avoid fracture failure, the tool material must possess high toughness.Toughness is the capacity of a material to absorb energy without failing.It is usually characterized by a combination of strength and ductility in the material. \r\r\u27a2 \rHot hardness. Hot hardness is the ability of a material to retain its hardness at high temperatures. This is required because of the high-temperature environment in which the tool operates. \r\r\r\r\u27a2 Wear resistance. Hardness is the single most important property needed to resist abrasive wear. All cutting-tool materials must be hard. However, wear resistance in metal cutting depends on more than just tool hardness, because of the other tool-wear mechanisms. Other characteristics affecting wear resistance include surface \ufb01nish on the tool (a smoother surface means a lower coef\ufb01cient of friction), chemistry of tool and work materials, and whether a cutting \ufb02uid is used. \rCutting-tool materials achieve this combination of properties in varying degrees. In this section, the following cutting-tool materials are discussed: (1) high-speed steel and its predecessors, plain carbon and low alloy steels, (2) cast cobalt alloys, \r(3) cemented carbides, cermets, and coated carbides, (4) ceramics, (5) synthetic diamond and cubic boron nitride. Before examining these individual materials, a brief overview and technical comparison will be helpful. The historical development of these materials is described in Historical Note 22.1. Commercially, the most important tool materials are high-speed steel and cemented carbides, cermets, and coated carbides. These two categories account for more than 90% of the cutting tools used in machining operations. \rTable 22.1 and Figure 22.6 present data on properties of various tool materials. The properties are those related to the requirements of a cutting tool: hardness, toughness, and hot hardness. Table 22.1 lists room temperature hardness and transverse rupture strength for selected materials. Transverse rupture strength (Section \r3.1.3) is a property used to indicate toughness for hard materials. Figure 22.6 shows hardness as a function of temperature for several of the tool materials discussed in this section. \rTABLE \u2022 22.1 Typical hardness values (at room temperature) and transverse rupture strengths for various tool materials.a \r\r\rCompiled from [4], [9], [17], and other sources. aNote: The values of hardness and TRS are intended to be comparative and typical.

Mushet\u2019s tool steel was far superior to its predecessor in machining. \rFrederick W. Taylor stands as an important \ufb01 gure in the history of cutting tools. Starting around 1880 at Midvale Steel in Philadelphia and later at Bethlehem Steel in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, he began a series of experiments that lasted a quarter century, yielding a much improved understanding of the metal-cutting process. Among the developments resulting from the work of Taylor and colleague Maunsel White at Bethlehem was high-speed steel (HSS), a class of highly alloyed tool steels that permitted substantially higher cutting speeds than previous cutting tools. The superiority of HSS resulted not only from greater alloying, but also from re\ufb01nements in heat treatment. Tools of the new steel allowed cutting speeds more than twice those of Mushet\u2019s steel and almost four times those of plain carbon cast steels. \rTungsten carbide (WC) was \ufb01rst synthesized in the late 1890s. It took nearly three decades before a useful cutting tool material was developed by sintering the WC with a metallic binder to form cemented carbides. These were \ufb01rst used in metal cutting in the mid-1920s in Germany, and in the late 1920s in the United States (Historical Note 7.2). Cermet cutting tools based on titanium carbide were \ufb01 rst introduced in the 1950s, but their commercial importance dates from the 1970s. The \ufb01 rst coated carbides, consisting of one coating on a WC\u2013Co substrate, were \ufb01 rst used around 1970. Coating materials included TiC, TiN, and Al2O3. Modern coated carbides have three or more coatings of these and other hard materials. \rAttempts to use alumina ceramics in machining date from the early 1900s in Europe. Their brittleness inhibited success in these early applications. Processing re\ufb01 nements over many decades have resulted in property improvements in these materials. U.S. commercial use of ceramic cutting tools dates from the mid-1950s. \rThe \ufb01rst industrial diamonds were produced by the General Electric Company in 1954. They were single crystal diamonds that were applied with some success in grinding operations starting around 1957. Greater acceptance of diamond cutting tools has resulted from the use of sintered polycrystalline diamond (SPD), dating from the early 1970s. A similar tool material, sintered cubic boron nitride, was \ufb01rst introduced in 1969 by GE under the trade name Borazon. \r\r\rTABLE \u2022 22.2 Representative values of n and C in the Taylor tool life equation, Equation (22.1), for selected tool materials. \r\r\rCompiled from [4], [9], and other sources.

Machine tool practice has not always kept pace with cutting-tool technology. Limitations on horsepower, machine tool rigidity, spindle bearings, and the widespread use of older equipment in industry have acted to underutilize the possible upper speeds permitted by available cutting tools. \r\r22.2.1 HIGH-SPEED STEEL AND ITS PREDECESSORS \rBefore the development of high-speed steel, plain carbon steel and Mushet\u2019s steel were the principal tool materials for metal cutting. Today, these steels are rarely used in industrial machining applications. The plain carbon steels used as cutting tools could be heat-treated to achieve relatively high hardness (~ Rockwell C 60), because of their fairly high carbon content. However, with low alloying levels, they possess poor hot hardness (Figure 22.6), which renders them unusable in metal cutting except at speeds too slow to be practical by today\u2019s standards. Mushet\u2019s steel contained alloying elements tungsten (4%\u201312%) and manganese (2%\u20134%) in addition to carbon. It was displaced by the introduction of high speed steel and other advances in tool steel metallurgy. \rHigh-speed steel (HSS) is a highly alloyed tool steel capable of maintaining hardness at elevated temperatures better than high carbon and low alloy steels. Its good hot hardness permits tools made of HSS to be used at higher cutting speeds. Compared with the other tool materials at the time of its development, it was truly deserving of its name \u201chigh speed.\u201d A wide variety of high-speed steels is available, but they can be dividedintotwobasictypes:(1) tungsten-type,designatedT-gradesbytheAmerican Iron and Steel Institute (AISI); and (2) molybdenum-type, designated M-grades by AISI. \rTungsten-type HSS contains tungsten (W) as its principal alloying ingredient.Additional alloying elements are chromium (Cr), and vanadium (V). One of the original and best known HSS grades is T1, or 18-4-1 high-speed steel, containing 18% W, 4% Cr, and 1% V. Molybdenum HSS grades contain combinations of tungsten and molybdenum (Mo), plus the same additional alloying elements as in the T-grades. Cobalt (Co) is sometimes added to HSS to enhance hot hardness. Of course, high-speed steel contains carbon, the element common to all steels. Typical alloying contents and functions of each alloying element in HSS are listed in Table 22.4. \rCommercially, high-speed steel is one of the most important cutting-tool materials in use today, despite the fact that it was introduced more than a century ago.

Typical alloying contents and functions of each alloying element in HSS are listed in Table 22.4. \rCommercially, high-speed steel is one of the most important cutting-tool materials in use today, despite the fact that it was introduced more than a century ago. HSS is especially suited to applications involving complicated tool geometries, such as drills, taps, milling cutters, and broaches. These complex shapes are generally easier and less expensive to produce from unhardened HSS than other tool materials.They can then be heat-treated so that cutting-edge hardness is very good (Rockwell C 65) whereas toughness of the internal portions of the tool is also good. HSS cutters possess better toughness than any of the harder nonsteel tool materials used for machining, such as cemented carbides and ceramics. Even for single-point tools, HSS is popular among machinists because of the ease with which a desired tool geometry can be ground into the tool point. Over the years, improvements have been made in the metallurgical formulation and processing of HSS so that this class of tool material remains competitive in many applications. Also, HSS tools, drills in particular, are often coated with a thin \ufb01lm of titanium nitride (TiN) to provide signi\ufb01cant increases in cutting performance. Physical vapor deposition processes (Section \r27.5.1) are commonly used to coat these HSS tools. \r\rTABLE \u2022 22.4 Typical contents and functions of alloying elements in high-speed steel. \r\r\r22.2.2 CAST COBALT ALLOYS \rCast cobalt alloy cutting tools consist of cobalt, around 40% to 50%; chromium, about 25% to 35%; and tungsten, usually 15% to 20%; with trace amounts of other elements. These tools are made into the desired shape by casting in graphite molds and then grinding to \ufb01 nal size and cutting-edge sharpness. High hardness is achieved as cast, an advantage over HSS, which requires heat treatment to achieve its hardness. Wear resistance of the cast cobalts is better than high-speed steel, but not as good as cemented carbide. Toughness of cast cobalt tools is better than carbides but not as good as HSS. Hot hardness also lies between these two materials. \rAs might be expected from their properties, applications of cast cobalt tools are generally between those of high-speed steel and cemented carbides. They are capable of heavy roughing cuts at speeds greater than HSS and feeds greater than carbides. Work materials include both steels and nonsteels, as well as nonmetallic materials such as plastics and graphite.Today,cast cobalt alloy tools are not nearly as important commercially as either high-speed steel or cemented carbides. They were introduced around 1915 as a tool material that would allow higher cutting speeds than HSS. The carbides were subsequently developed and proved to be superior to the cast Co alloys in most cutting situations. \r\r22.2.3 CEMENTED CARBIDES, CERMETS, AND COATED CARBIDES \rCermets are de\ufb01ned as composites of ceramic and metallic materials (Section 9.2.1). Technically speaking, cemented carbides are included within this de\ufb01nition; however, cermets based on WC\u2013Co, including WC\u2013TiC\u2013TaC\u2013Co, are known as carbides (cemented carbides) in common usage. In cutting-tool terminology, the term cermet is applied to ceramic-metal composites containing TiC, TiN, and certain other ceramics not including WC. One of the advances in cutting-tool materials involves the application of a very thin coating to a WC\u2013Co substrate.

There may be other carbide compounds in the mixture, such as titanium carbide (TiC) and/or tantalum carbide (TaC), in addition to WC. \rThe \ufb01rst cemented carbide cutting tools were made of WC\u2013Co (Historical Note 7.2) and could be used to machine cast irons and nonsteel materials at cutting speeds faster than those possible with high-speed steel and cast cobalt alloys. However, when the straight WC\u2013Co tools were used to cut steel, crater wear occurred rapidly, leading to early failure of the tools. A strong chemical af\ufb01 nity exists between steel and the carbon in WC, resulting in accelerated wear by diffusion and chemical reaction at the tool\u2013chip interface for this work-tool combination. Consequently, straight WC\u2013Co tools cannot be used effectively to machine steel. It was subsequently discovered that additions of titanium carbide and tantalum carbide to the WC\u2013Co mix signi\ufb01cantly retarded the rate of crater wear when cutting steel. These new WC\u2013TiC\u2013TaC\u2013Co tools could be used for steel machining. The result is that cemented carbides are divided into two basic types: (1) nonsteel-cutting grades, consisting of only WC\u2013Co; and (2) steel-cutting grades, with combinations of TiC and TaC added to the WC\u2013Co. \rThe general properties of the two types of cemented carbides are similar: (1) high compressive strength but low-to-moderate tensile strength; (2) high hardness (90 to 95 HRA); (3) good hot hardness; (4) good wear resistance; (5) high thermal conductivity; (6) high modulus of elasticity\u2014E values up to around 600 # 103 MPa (90 # 106lb/in2); and (7) toughness lower than high-speed steel. \rNonsteel-cutting grades refer to those cemented carbides that are suitable for machining aluminum, brass, copper, magnesium, titanium, and other nonferrous metals; anomalously, gray cast iron is included in this group of work materials. In the nonsteel-cutting grades, grain size and cobalt content are the factors that in\ufb02uence properties of the cemented carbide material. The typical grain size found in conventional cemented carbides ranges between 0.5 and 5 mm (20 and 200 m-in). As grain size is increased, hardness and hot hardness decrease, but transverse rupture strength increases.2 The typical cobalt content in cemented carbides used for cutting tools is 3 to 12%. The effect of cobalt content on hardness and transverse rupture strength is shown in Figure 9.9. As cobalt content increases, TRS improves at the expense of hardness and wear resistance. Cemented carbides with low percentages of cobalt content (3%\u20136%) have high hardness and low TRS, whereas carbides with high Co (6%\u201312%) have high TRS but lower hardness (Table 22.1). Accordingly, cemented carbides with higher cobalt are used for roughing operations and interrupted cuts (such as milling), while carbides with lower cobalt (therefore, higher hardness and wear resistance) are used in \ufb01nishing cuts. \r2The effect of grainsize (GS) on transverse rupture strength (TRS) is more complicated than reported here.

For these carbide grades, titanium carbide and/or tantalum carbide is substituted for some of the tungsten carbide. TiC is the more popular additive in most applications. Typically, from 10% to 25% of the WC might be replaced by combinations of TiC and TaC. This composition increases the crater wear resistance for steel cutting, but tends to adversely affect \ufb02ank wear resistance for nonsteel-cutting applications.That is why two basic categories of cemented carbide are needed. \rOne of the important developments in cemented carbide technology in recent years is the use of very \ufb01ne grain sizes (submicron sizes) of the various carbide ingredients (WC,TiC,andTaC).Although small grain size is usually associated with higher hardness but lower transverse rupture strength, the decrease in TRS is reduced or reversed at the submicron particle sizes. Therefore, these ultra\ufb01 ne grain carbides possess high hardness combined with good toughness. \rSince the two basic types of cemented carbide were introduced in the 1920s and 1930s, the increasing number and variety of engineering materials have complicated the selection of the most appropriate cemented carbide for a given machining application. To address the problem of grade selection, two classi\ufb01cation systems have been developed: (1) the ANSI3 C-grade system, developed in the United States starting around 1942; and (2) the ISO R513-1975(E) system, introduced by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) around 1964. In the C-grade system, summarized in Table 22.5, machining grades of cemented carbide are divided into two basic groups, corresponding to nonsteel-cutting and steel-cutting categories. Within each group there are four levels, corresponding to roughing, general purpose, \ufb01nishing, and precision \ufb01nishing. \rThe ISO R513-1975(E) system, titled \u201cApplication of Carbides for Machining by Chip Removal,\u201d classi\ufb01es all machining grades of cemented carbides into three basic groups, each with its own letter and color code, as summarized in Table 22.6. Within each group, the grades are numbered on a scale that ranges from maximum hardness to maximum toughness. Harder grades are used for \ufb01nishing operations (high speeds, low feeds and depths), whereas tougher grades are used for roughing operations. The ISO classi\ufb01cation system can also be used to recommend applications for cermets and coated carbides. \rThe two systems map into each other as follows:The ANSI C1 through C4-grades map into the ISO K-grades, but in reverse numerical order, and the ANSI C5 through C8 grades translate into the ISO P-grades, but again in reverse numerical order. \r3ANSI !

Higher speeds are generally allowed with these tools compared with steel-cutting carbide grades. Lower feeds are typically used so that better surface \ufb01 nish is achieved, often eliminating the need for grinding. \rCoated Carbides The development of coated carbides around 1970 represented a signi\ufb01cant advance in cutting-tool technology. Coated carbides are a cemented carbide insert coated with one or more thin layers of wear resistant material, such as titanium carbide, titanium nitride, and/or aluminum oxide (Al2O3). The coating is applied to the substrate by chemical vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition (Section 27.5). The coating thickness is only 2.5 to 13 mm (0.0001\u20130.0005 in). It has been found that thicker coatings tend to be brittle, resulting in cracking, chipping, and separation from the substrate. \rThe \ufb01rst generation of coated carbides had only a single layer coating (TiC, TiN, or Al2O3). More recently, coated inserts have been developed that consist of multiple layers. The \ufb01rst layer applied to the WC\u2013Co base is usually TiN or TiCN because of good adhesion and similar coef\ufb01cient of thermal expansion. Additional layers of various combinations of TiN, TiCN, Al2O3, and TiAlN are subsequently applied (see Figure 27.8). \rCoated carbides are used to machine cast irons and steels in turning and milling operations. They are best applied at high cutting speeds in situations in which dynamic force and thermal shock are minimal. If these conditions become too severe, as in some interrupted cut operations, chipping of the coating can occur, resulting in premature tool failure. In this situation, uncoated carbides formulated for toughness are preferred. When properly applied, coated carbide tools usually permit increases in allowable cutting speeds compared with uncoated cemented carbides. \rUse of coated carbide tools is expanding to nonferrous metal and nonmetal applications for improved tool life and higher cutting speeds. Different coating materials are required, such as chromium carbide (CrC), zirconium nitride (ZrN), and diamond [11]. \r\r\r22.2.4 CERAMICS \rCutting tools made from ceramics were \ufb01rst used commercially in the United States in the mid-1950s, although their development and use in Europe dates back to the early 1900s. Today\u2019s ceramic cutting tools are composed primarily of \ufb01ne-grained aluminum oxide (Al2O3), pressed and sintered at high pressures and temperatures with no binder into insert form. The aluminum oxide is usually very pure (99% is typical), although some manufacturers add other oxides (such as zirconium oxide) in small amounts. In producing ceramic tools, it is important to use a very \ufb01ne grain size in the alumina powder, and to maximize density of the mix through high-pressure compaction to improve the material\u2019s low toughness. \rAluminum oxide cutting tools are most successful in high-speed turning of cast iron and steel. Applications also include \ufb01nish turning of hardened steels using high cutting speeds, low feeds and depths, and a rigid work setup. Many premature fracture failures of ceramic tools occur because of nonrigid machine tool setups, which subject the tools to mechanical shock.

Applications also include \ufb01nish turning of hardened steels using high cutting speeds, low feeds and depths, and a rigid work setup. Many premature fracture failures of ceramic tools occur because of nonrigid machine tool setups, which subject the tools to mechanical shock. When properly applied, ceramic cutting tools can be used to obtain very good surface \ufb01nish. Ceramics are not recommended for heavy interrupted cut operations (e.g., rough milling) because of their low toughness. In addition to its use as inserts in conventional machining operations, Al2O3 is widely used as an abrasive in grinding and other abrasive processes (Chapter 24). \rOther commercially available ceramic cutting-tool materials include silicon nitride (SiN), sialon (silicon nitride and aluminum oxide, SiN\u2013Al2O3), aluminum oxide and titanium carbide (Al2O3\u2013TiC), and aluminum oxide reinforced with single crystal-whiskers of silicon carbide.These tools are usually intended for special applications,a discussion of which is beyond the scope of this introductory treatment. \r\r22.2.5 SYNTHETIC DIAMONDS AND CUBIC BORON NITRIDE \rDiamond is the hardest material known (Section 7.6.1). By some measures of hardness, diamond is three to four times as hard as tungsten carbide or aluminum oxide. Since high hardness is one of the desirable properties of a cutting tool, it is natural to think of diamonds for machining and grinding applications. Synthetic diamond cutting tools are made of sintered polycrystalline diamond (SPD), which dates from the early 1970s. Sintered polycrystalline diamond is fabricated by sintering \ufb01ne-grained diamond crystals under high temperatures and pressures into the desired shape. Little or no binder is used. The crystals have a random orientation and this adds considerable toughness to the SPD tools compared with single crystal diamonds. Tool inserts are typically made by depositing a layer of SPD about 0.5 mm (0.020 in) thick on the surface of a cemented carbide base. Very small inserts have also been made of 100% SPD. \rApplications of diamond cutting tools include high-speed machining of nonferrous metals and abrasive nonmetals such as \ufb01berglass, graphite, and wood. Machining of steel, other ferrous metals, and nickel-based alloys with SPD tools is not practical because of the chemical af\ufb01nity that exists between these metals and carbon (a diamond, after all, is carbon). \rNext to diamond, cubic boron nitride (Section 7.3.3) is the hardest material known, and its fabrication into cutting tool inserts is basically the same as SPD, that is, coatings on WC\u2013Co inserts. Cubic boron nitride (symbolized cBN) does not react chemically with iron and nickel as SPD does; therefore, the applications of cBN-coated tools are for machining steel and nickel-based alloys. Both SPD and cBN tools are expensive, as one might expect, and the applications must justify the additional tooling cost. \r\r\r\r\rTool Geometry \rOne important way to classify cutting tools is according to the machining process. Thus, there are turning tools, cutoff tools, milling cutters, drill bits, reamers, taps, and many other cutting tools that are named for the operation in which they are used, each with its own tool geometry\u2014in some cases quite unique. \rAs indicated in Section 20.1, cutting tools can be divided into single-point tools and multiple-cutting-edge tools. Single-point tools are used in turning, boring, shaping, and planing. Multiple-cutting-edge tools are used in drilling, reaming, tapping, milling, broaching, and sawing. Many of the principles that apply to single-point tools also apply to the other cutting-tool types, simply because the mechanism of chip formation is basically the same for all machining operations. \rTable 22.7 presents a troubleshooting guide that summarizes many of the actions \rthat can be taken to reduce tooling problems that might result from nonoptimal \r application of cutting conditions, tool material, and/or tool geometry. \r\rTABLE \u2022 22.7 Troubleshooting Guide for Cutting Tool Problems.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 39420, "end_char_idx": 43754, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f2264c3-5b1c-4e24-989c-4d3c1ff80ade": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f2264c3-5b1c-4e24-989c-4d3c1ff80ade", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec22.txt", "file_name": "sec22.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75223, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b518e04b-68fb-4077-81ed-392f53229ed9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec22.txt", "file_name": "sec22.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75223, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "67ecebff1133b156b1ffe4bfe3ac4f4380f131a3575abe2d32e2ba2860de10b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "55a066f9-d05a-420b-97c8-1681503cdc2d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec22.txt", "file_name": "sec22.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 75223, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "5a8e1203eda868306afe0cc0d86781ebc6a97cd6fea78ce0cb1e56cbb1fba3ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6ef74e2a-fa18-4efc-9685-1d67652eec4d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ef3fc52565502f4b17d1e44f9c682f276c319fe51ac13bd8c33180bc8b1a7f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "As indicated in Section 20.1, cutting tools can be divided into single-point tools and multiple-cutting-edge tools.

Figure 22.7 shows a more detailed drawing. \rThe rake angle of a cutting tool has previously been treated as one parameter. In a single-point tool, the orientation of the rake face is de\ufb01ned by two angles, back rake angle (ab) and side rake angle (as). Together, these angles are in\ufb02 uential in determining the direction of chip \ufb02ow across the rake face. The \ufb02 ank surface of the tool is de\ufb01ned by the end relief angle (ERA) and side relief angle (SRA). These angles determine the amount of clearance between the tool and the freshly cut work surface. The cutting edge of a single-point tool is divided into two sections, side cutting edge and end cutting edge. These two sections are separated by the tool point, which has a certain radius,called the nose radius.The side cutting edge angle (SCEA) determines the entry of the tool into the work and can be used to reduce the sudden force the tool experiences as it enters a work part. Nose radius (NR) determines to a large degree the texture of the surface generated in the operation. A very pointed tool (small nose radius) results in very pronounced feed marks on the surface (Section 23.2.2). End cutting edge angle (ECEA) provides a clearance between the trailing edge of the tool and the newly generated work surface, thus reducing rubbing and friction against the surface. \rIn all, there are seven elements of tool geometry for a single-point tool. When speci\ufb01ed in the following order, they are collectively called the tool geometry signature: back rake angle, side rake angle, end relief angle, side relief angle, end cutting edge angle, side cutting edge angle, and nose radius. For example, a single-point tool used in turning might have the following signature: 5, 5, 7, 7, 20, 15, 0.8 mm. \rChip Breakers Chip disposal is a problem that is often encountered in turning and other continuous operations. Long, stringy chips are often generated, especially when turning ductile materials at high speeds. These chips cause a hazard to the machine \r\r\rFIGURE 22.8 Two methods of chipbreaking in single-pointtools: (a) groove-typeand (b) obstruction-type chip breakers. \roperator and the work part \ufb01nish, and they interfere with automatic operation of the turning process. Chip breakers are frequently used with single-point tools to force the chips to curl more tightly than they would naturally be inclined to do, thus causing them to fracture.There are two principal forms of chip breaker design commonly used on single-point turning tools, illustrated in Figure 22.8: (a) groove-type chip breaker designed into the cutting tool itself, and (b) obstruction-type chip breaker designed as an additional device on the rake face of the tool.The chip breaker distance can be adjusted in the obstruction-type device for different cutting conditions. \rEffect of Tool Material on Tool Geometry It was noted in the discussion of the Merchant equation (Section 20.3.2) that a positive rake angle is generally desirable because it reduces cutting forces, temperature, and power consumption. High speed steel cutting tools are almost always ground with positive rake angles, typically ranging from 5\u00b0 to 20\u00b0.

High speed steel cutting tools are almost always ground with positive rake angles, typically ranging from 5\u00b0 to 20\u00b0. HSS has good strength and toughness, so that the thinner cross section of the tool created by high positive rake angles does not usually cause a problem with tool breakage. HSS tools are predominantly made of one piece. The heat treatment of high-speed steel can be controlled to provide a hard cutting edge while maintaining a tough inner core. \rWith the development of the very hard tool materials (e.g., cemented carbides and ceramics), changes in tool geometry were required. As a group, these materials have higher hardness and lower toughness than HSS. Also, their shear and tensile strengths are low relative to their compressive strengths, and their properties cannot be manipulated through heat treatment like those of HSS. Finally, cost per unit weight for these very hard materials is higher than the cost of HSS. These factors have affected cutting-tool design for the very hard tool materials in several ways. \rFirst, the very hard materials must be designed with either negative rake or small positive angles. This change tends to load the tool more in compression and less in shear, thus favoring the high compressive strength of these harder materials. Cemented carbides, for example, are used with rake angles typically in the range from 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0. Ceramics have rake angles between \u20135\u00b0 and \u201315\u00b0. Relief angles are made as small as possible (5\u00b0 is typical) to provide as much support for the cutting edge as possible. \rAnother difference is the way in which the cutting edge of the tool is held in position.

The geometry of a HSS tool is ground from a solid shank, as shown in part (a) of the \ufb01gure. The higher cost and differences in properties and processing of the harder tool materials have given rise to the use of inserts that are either brazed or mechanically clamped to a tool-holder. Part (b) shows a brazed insert, in which a cemented carbide insert is brazed to a tool shank.The shank is made of tool steel for strength and toughness. Part (c) illustrates one possible design for mechanically clamping an insert in a toolholder. Mechanical clamping is used for cemented carbides, ceramics, and the other hard materials. The signi\ufb01cant advantage of the mechanically clamped insert is that each insert contains multiple cutting edges. When an edge wears out, the insert is unclamped, indexed (rotated in the toolholder) to the next edge, and reclamped in the toolholder. When all of the cutting edges are worn, the insert is discarded and replaced. \rInserts Cutting-tool inserts are widely used in machining because they are economical and adaptable to many different types of machining operations: turning, boring, threading, milling, and even drilling.They are available in a variety of shapes and sizes for the variety of cutting situations encountered in practice. A square insert is shown in Figure 22.9(c). Other common shapes used in turning operations are displayed in Figure 22.10. In general, the largest point angle should be selected for strength and economy. Round inserts possess large point angles (and large nose radii) just because of their shape. Inserts with large point angles are inherently stronger and less likely to chip or break during cutting, but they require more power, and there is a greater likelihood of vibration. The economic advantage of round inserts is that they can be indexed multiple times for more cuts per insert.

Primary examples are drilling and milling. On the other hand, broaching and some sawing operations (hack sawing and band sawing) use multiple-cutting-edge tools that operate with a linear motion. Other sawing operations (circular sawing) use rotating saw blades. \rDrills Various cutting tools are available for hole making, but the twist drill is by far the most common.

It comes in diameters ranging from about 0.15 mm (0.006 in) to as large as 75 mm (3.0 in).Twist drills are widely used in industry to produce holes rapidly and economically. \rThe standard twist drill geometry is illustrated in Figure 22.12.The body of the drill has two spiral \ufb02 utes (the spiral gives the twist drill its name). The angle of the spiral \ufb02 utes is called the helix angle, a typical value of which is around 30\u00b0. While drilling, the \ufb02utes act as passageways for extraction of chips from the hole. Although it is desirable for the \ufb02ute openings to be large to provide maximum clearance for the chips, the body of the drill must be supported over its length.This support is provided by the web, which is the thickness of the drill between the \ufb02 utes. \rThe point of the twist drill has a conical shape.A typical value for the point angle is 118\u00b0. The point can be designed in various ways, but the most common design is a chisel edge, as in Figure 22.12. Connected to the chisel edge are two cutting edges (sometimes called lips) that lead into the \ufb02utes.The portion of each \ufb02ute adjacent to the cutting edge acts as the rake face of the tool. \rThe cutting action of the twist drill is complex. The rotation and feeding of the drill bit result in relative motion between the cutting edges and the workpiece to form the chips. The cutting speed along each cutting edge varies as a function of the distance from the axis of rotation. Accordingly, the ef\ufb01ciency of the cutting action varies, being most ef\ufb01cient at the outer diameter of the drill and least ef\ufb01cient at the center. In fact, the relative velocity at the drill point is zero, so no cutting takes place. Instead, the chisel edge of the drill point pushes aside the material at the center as it penetrates into the hole; a large thrust force is required to drive the twist drill forward into the hole. Also, at the beginning of the operation, the rotating chisel edge tends to wander on the surface of the work part, causing loss of positional accuracy. Various alternative drill point designs have been developed to address this problem. \rChip removal can be a problem in drilling. The cutting action takes place inside the hole, and the \ufb02utes must provide suf\ufb01cient clearance throughout the length of \r\r\rFIGURE 22.13 \r\rStraight-\ufb02ute drill that uses indexable inserts. \rCarbide Flute Detail showing \rinserts (2) shape ofsix-sided insert (typical) \r\rHole for clamping \rthe drill to allow the chips to be extracted from the hole. As the chip is formed it is forced through the \ufb02utes to the work surface. Friction makes matters worse in two ways. In addition to the usual friction in metal cutting between the chip and the rake face of the cutting edge, friction also results from rubbing between the outside diameter of the drill bit and the newly formed hole.This increases the temperature of the drill and work. Delivery of cutting \ufb02uid to the drill point to reduce the friction and heat is dif\ufb01cult because the chips are \ufb02owing in the opposite direction. Because of chip removal and heat, a twist drill is normally limited to a hole depth of about four times its diameter. Some twist drills are designed with internal holes running their lengths, through which cutting \ufb02uid can be pumped to the hole near the drill point, thus delivering the \ufb02uid directly to the cutting operation. An alternative approach with twist drills that do not have \ufb02uid holes is to use a \u201cpecking\u201d procedure during the drilling operation. In this procedure, the drill is periodically withdrawn from the hole to clear the chips before proceeding deeper. \rTwist drills are normally made of high-speed steel. The geometry of the drill is fabricated before heat treatment, and then the outer shell of the drill (cutting edges and friction surfaces) is hardened while retaining an inner core that is relatively tough.

Straight-\ufb02 ute drills operate like twist drills except that the \ufb02utes for chip removal are straight along the length of the tool rather than spiraled. The simpler design of the straight-\ufb02ute drill permits carbide tips to be used as the cutting edges, either as brazed or indexable inserts. Figure 22.13 illustrates the straight-\ufb02ute indexable-insert drill. The cemented carbide inserts allow higher cutting speeds and greater production rates than HSS twist drills. However, the inserts limit how small the drills can be made. Thus, the diameter range of commercially available indexable-insert drills runs from about 16 mm (0.625 in) to about 127 mm (5 in) [9]. \rA straight-\ufb02ute drill designed for deep-hole drilling is the gun drill, shown in Figure 22.14. Whereas the twist drill is usually limited to a depth-to-diameter ratio of 4:1, and the straight-\ufb02ute drill to about 3:1, the gun drill can cut holes up to 125 times its diameter. As shown in the \ufb01gure, the gun drill has a carbide cutting edge, a single \ufb02ute for chip removal, and a coolant hole running its complete length. In the typical gun drilling operation, the work rotates around the stationary drill (opposite \r\rFIGURE 22.14 \rGun drill. \rFIGURE 22.15 \rSpade drill. \rCarbide tip \r\r\rof most drilling operations), and the coolant \ufb02ows into the cutting process and out of the hole along the \ufb02ute, carrying the chips with it. Gun drills range in diameter from less than 2 mm (0.075 in) to about 50 mm (2 in). \rIt was previously mentioned that twist drills are available with diameters up to 75 mm (3 in).Twist drills that large are uncommon because so much metal is required in the drill bit.An alternative for large diameter holes is the spade drill, illustrated in Figure 22.15. Standard sizes range from 25 to 152 mm (1\u20136 in). The interchangeable drill bit is held in a toolholder,which provides rigidity during cutting.The mass of the spade drill is much less than a twist drill of the same diameter. \rMore information on hole-making tools can be found in references [3] and [9]. \rMilling Cutters Classi\ufb01cation of milling cutters is closely associated with the milling operations described in Section 21.4.1.The major types of milling cutters are the following: \r\u27a2 Plain milling cutters.

These are designed with teeth that cut on both the periphery as well as the end of the cutter. Face milling cutters can be made of HSS, as in Figure 21.17(b), or they can be designed to use cemented carbide inserts. Figure 22.17 shows a four-tooth face-milling cutter that uses inserts. \r\r\r\r\rFIGURE 22.17 Tool geometry elements of a four-tooth face milling cutter: (a) side view and (b) bottom view. \r\rFIGURE 22.18 The broach: (a) terminologyof the tooth geometry, and (b) a typical broachused for internal broaching. \r\u27a2 End milling cutters. As shown in Figure 21.20(c), an end milling cutter looks like a drill bit, but close inspection indicates that it is designed for primary cutting with its peripheral teeth rather than its end. (A drill bit cuts only on its end as it penetrates into the work.) End mills are designed with square ends, ends with radii, and ball ends. End mills can be used for face milling, pro\ufb01le milling and pocketing, cutting slots, engraving, surface contouring, and die sinking. \rBroaches The terminology and geometry of the broach are illustrated in Figure 22.18. The broach consists of a series of distinct cutting teeth along its length. Feed is accomplished by the increased step between successive teeth on the broach. This feeding action is unique among machining operations, because most operations accomplish feeding by a relative feed motion that is carried out by either the tool or the work.The total material removed in a single pass of the broach is the cumulative result of all the steps in the tool. The speed motion is accomplished by the linear travel of the tool past the work surface. The shape of the cut surface is determined by the contour of the cutting edges on the broach, particularly the \ufb01nal cutting edge. Owing to its complex geometry and the low speeds used in broaching, most broaches are made of HSS. In broaching of certain cast irons, the cutting edges are cemented carbide inserts either brazed or mechanically held in place on the broaching tool. \rSaw Blades For each of the three sawing operations (Section 21.5.3), the saw blades possess certain common features, including tooth form, tooth spacing, and tooth set, as seen in Figure 22.19. Tooth form is concerned with the geometry of each cutting tooth. Rake angle, clearance angle, tooth spacing, and other features of geometry are \r\rFIGURE 22.19 Features of saw blades: (a) nomenclature for saw blade geometries, (b) two common tooth forms,and (c) two types of tooth set. \rshown in Figure 22.19(a). Tooth spacing is the distance between adjacent teeth on the saw blade. This parameter determines the size of the teeth and the size of the gullet between teeth. The gullet allows space for the formation of the chip by the adjacent cutting tooth. Different tooth forms are appropriate for different work materials and cutting situations.Two forms commonly used in hacksaw and bandsaw blades are shown in Figure 22.19(b).The tooth set permits the kerf cut by the saw blade to be wider than the width of the blade itself; otherwise the blade would bind against the walls of the slit made by the saw.Two common tooth sets are illustrated in Figure 22.19(c). \r\r\r\r\rCutting Fluids \rA cutting \ufb02 uid is any liquid or gas that is applied directly to the machining operation to improve cutting performance.

Cutting \ufb02uids address two main problems: (1) heat generation at the shear zone and friction zone, and (2) friction at the tool\u2013chip and tool\u2013work interfaces. In addition to removing heat and reducing friction, cutting \ufb02uids provide additional bene\ufb01ts, such as washing away chips (especially in grinding and milling), reducing the temperature of the work part for easier handling, reducing cutting forces and power requirements, improving dimensional stability of the work part, and improving surface \ufb01nish. \r\r22.4.1 TYPES OF CUTTING FLUIDS \rA variety of cutting \ufb02uids are commercially available. It is appropriate to discuss them \ufb01 rst according to function and then to classify them according to chemical formulation. \r\rCutting Fluid Functions There are two general categories of cutting \ufb02uids, corresponding to the two main problems they are designed to address: coolants and lubricants. Coolants are cutting \ufb02uids designed to reduce the effects of heat in the machining operation.They have a limited effect on the amount of heat energy generated in cutting; instead, they carry away the heat that is generated, thereby reducing the temperature of tool and workpiece. This helps to prolong the life of the cutting tool.The capacity of a cutting \ufb02uid to reduce temperatures in machining depends on its thermal properties. Speci\ufb01c heat and thermal conductivity are the most important properties (Section 4.2.1).Water has high speci\ufb01c heat and thermal conductivity relative to other liquids, which is why water is used as the base in coolant-type cutting \ufb02uids.These properties allow the coolant to draw heat away from the operation, thereby reducing the temperature of the cutting tool. \rCoolant-type cutting \ufb02uids seem to be most effective at relatively high cutting speeds in which heat generation and high temperatures are problems.They are most effective on tool materials that are most susceptible to temperature failures, such as high-speed steels, and are used frequently in turning and milling operations in which large amounts of heat are generated. \rLubricants are usually oil-based \ufb02uids (because oils possess good lubricating qualities) formulated to reduce friction at the tool\u2013chip and tool\u2013work interfaces. Lubricant cutting \ufb02uids operate by extreme pressure lubrication, a special form of lubrication that involves formation of thin solid salt layers on the hot, clean metal surfaces through chemical reaction with the lubricant. Compounds of sulfur, chlorine, and phosphorous in the lubricant cause the formation of these surface layers, which act to separate the two metal surfaces (i.e.,chip and tool).These extreme pressure \ufb01 lms are signi\ufb01 cantly more effective in reducing friction in metal cutting than conventional lubrication, which is based on the presence of liquid \ufb01lms between the two surfaces. \rLubricant-type cutting \ufb02uids are most effective at lower cutting speeds.They tend to lose their effectiveness at high speeds, above about 120 m/min (400 ft/min), because the motion of the chip at these speeds prevents the cutting \ufb02uid from reaching the tool\u2013chip interface. In addition, high cutting temperatures at these speeds cause the oils to vaporize before they can lubricate. Machining operations such as drilling and tapping usually bene\ufb01t from lubricants.

According to Merchant\u2019s equation, Equation 21.16, a lower friction angle causes the shear plane angle to increase, hence reducing the amount of heat energy generated in the shear zone. \rThere is typically an overlapping effect between the two types of cutting \ufb02uids. Coolants are formulated with ingredients that help reduce friction. And lubricants have thermal properties that, although not as good as those of water, act to remove heat from the cutting operation. Cutting \ufb02uids (both coolants and lubricants) manifest their effect on the Taylor tool life equation through higher C values. Increases of 10% to 40% are typical. The slope n is not signi\ufb01cantly affected. \rChemical Formulation of Cutting Fluids There are four categories of cutting \ufb02uids according to chemical formulation: (1) cutting oils, (2) emulsi\ufb01ed oils, \r(3) semichemical \ufb02uids, and (4) chemical \ufb02uids. All of these cutting \ufb02uids provide both coolant and lubricating functions. The cutting oils are most effective as lubricants, whereas the other three categories are more effective as coolants because they are primarily water. \rCutting oils are based on oil derived from petroleum, animal, marine, or vegetable origin. Mineral oils (petroleum based) are the principal type because of their abundance and generally desirable lubricating characteristics. To achieve maximum lubricity, several types of oils are often combined in the same \ufb02 uid. Chemical additives are also mixed with the oils to increase lubricating qualities. These additives contain compounds of sulfur, chlorine, and phosphorous, and are designed to react chemically with the chip and tool surfaces to form solid \ufb01lms (extreme pressure lubrication) that help to avoid metal-to-metal contact between the two. \rEmulsi\ufb01 ed oils consist of oil droplets suspended in water. The \ufb02uid is made by blending oil (usually mineral oil) in water using an emulsifying agent to promote blending and stability of the emulsion. A typical ratio of water to oil is 30:1. Chemical additives based on sulfur, chlorine, and phosphorous are often used to promote extreme pressure lubrication. Because they contain both oil and water, the emulsi\ufb01ed oils combine cooling and lubricating qualities in one cutting \ufb02 uid. \rChemical \ufb02 uids are chemicals in a water solution rather than oils in emulsion. The dissolved chemicals include compounds of sulfur, chlorine, and phosphorous, plus wetting agents. The chemicals are intended to provide some degree of lubrication to the solution. Chemical \ufb02uids provide good coolant qualities but their lubricating qualities are less than the other cutting \ufb02 uid types. Semichemical \ufb02 uids have small amounts of emulsi\ufb01 ed oil added to increase the lubricating characteristics of the cutting \ufb02uid. In effect, they are a hybrid class between chemical \ufb02 uids and emulsi\ufb01 ed oils. \rTable 22.8 presents a troubleshooting guide for machining problems related to the use of cutting \ufb02uids. \r\rTABLE \u2022 22.8 Troubleshooting Guide for Problems Related to Cutting Fluids. \r\r\r22.4.2 APPLICATION OF CUTTING FLUIDS \rCutting \ufb02uids are applied to machining operations in various ways, and this section considers these application methods.

In \ufb02 ooding, a steady stream of \ufb02uid is directed at the tool\u2013work or tool\u2013chip interface of the machining operation. A second method of delivery is mist application, primarily used for water-based cutting \ufb02uids. In this method the \ufb02uid is directed at the operation in the form of a high-speed mist carried by a pressurized air stream. Mist application is generally not as effective as \ufb02ooding in cooling the tool. However, because of the high-velocity air stream, mist application may be more effective in delivering the cutting \ufb02uid to areas that are dif\ufb01cult to access by conventional \ufb02 ooding. \rManual application by means of a squirt can or paint brush is sometimes used for applying lubricants in tapping and other operations in which cutting speeds are low and friction is a problem. It is generally not preferred by most production machine shops because of its variability in application. \rCutting Fluid Filtration and Dry Machining Cutting \ufb02uids become contaminated over time with a variety of foreign substances, such as tramp oil (machine oil, hydraulic \ufb02uid, etc.), garbage (cigarette butts, food, etc.), small chips, molds, fungi, and bacteria. In addition to causing odors and health hazards, contaminated cutting \ufb02uids do not perform their lubricating function as well. Alternative ways of dealing with this problem are to (1) replace the cutting \ufb02uid at regular and frequent intervals (perhaps twice per month); (2) use a \ufb01ltration system to continuously or periodically clean the \ufb02uid; or (3) dry machining, that is, machining without cutting \ufb02uids. Because of growing concern about environmental pollution and associated legislation, disposing old \ufb02uids has become both costly and contrary to the general public welfare. \rFiltration systems are being installed in numerous machine shops today to solve the contamination problem. Advantages of these systems include (1) prolonged cutting \ufb02uid life between changes\u2014instead of replacing the \ufb02uid once or twice per month, coolant lives of 1 year have been reported; (2) reduced \ufb02uid disposal cost, since disposal is much less frequent when a \ufb01lter is used; (3) cleaner cutting \ufb02uid for better working environment and reduced health hazards; (4) lower machine tool maintenance;and (5) longer tool life.There are various types of \ufb01ltration systems for \ufb01ltering cutting \ufb02uids. For the interested reader, \ufb01ltration systems and the bene\ufb01ts of using them are discussed in reference [19]. \rThe third alternative is called dry machining, meaning that no cutting \ufb02uid is used. Dry machining avoids the problems of cutting \ufb02 uid contamination, disposal, and \ufb01ltration, but can lead to problems of its own: (1) overheating the tool, (2) operating at lower cutting speeds and production rates to prolong tool life, and \r(3) absence of chip removal bene\ufb01ts in grinding and milling.

The \ufb01rst topic is machinability, which is concerned with how work material properties affect machining perform-ance.The second topic is concerned with the tolerances and surface \ufb01nishes (Chapter 5) that can be expected in machining processes. Third, the selection of cutting conditions (speed, feed, and depth of cut) in a machining operation is explored. This selection determines to a large extent the economic success of a given operation. Finally, some guidelines are provided for product designers to consider when they design parts that are to be produced by machining. \r\r\r\r\rMachinability \rProperties of the work material have a signi\ufb01cant in\ufb02uence on the success of the machining operation. These properties and other characteristics of the work are often summarized in the term \u201cmachinability.\u201d Machinability denotes the relative ease with which a material (usually a metal) can be machined using appropriate tooling and cutting conditions. \rThere are various criteria used to evaluate machinability, the most important of which are (1) tool life, \r(2) forces and power, (3) surface \ufb01nish, and (4) ease of chip disposal. Although machinability generally refers to the work material, it should be recognized that machining performance depends on more than just material. The type of machining operation, tooling, and cutting conditions are also important factors. In addition, the machinability criterion is a source of variation. One material may yield a longer tool life whereas another material provides a better surface \ufb01nish. All of these factors make evaluation of machinability dif\ufb01 cult. \r\r\rMachinability testing usually involves a comparison of work materials. The machining performance of a test material is measured relative to that of a base (standard) material. Possible measures of performance in machinability testing include (1) tool life, (2) tool wear, (3) cutting force, (4) power in the operation, (5) cutting temperature, and (6) material removal rate under standard test conditions. The relative performance is expressed as an index number, called the machinability rating (MR). The base material used as the standard is given a machinability rating of 1.00. B1112 steel is often used as the base material in machinability comparisons. Materials that are easier to machine than the base have ratings greater than 1.00, and materials that are more dif\ufb01cult to machine have ratings less than 1.00. Machinability ratings are often expressed as percentages rather than index numbers. The following example illustrates how a machinability rating might be determined using a tool life test as the basis of comparison. \rA series of tool life tests are conducted on two work materials under identical cutting conditions, varying only speed in the test procedure. The \ufb01rst material, de\ufb01ned as the base material, yields a Taylor Tool Life equation vT0.28  350, and the other material (test material) yields a Taylor equation vT0.27  440, where speed is in m/min and tool life is in min.

Important mechanical properties include hardness and strength. As hardness increases, abrasive wear of the tool increases so that tool life is reduced. Strength is usually indicated as tensile strength, even though machining involves shear stresses. Of course, shear strength and tensile strength are correlated. As work material strength increases, cutting forces, speci\ufb01c energy, and cutting temperature increase, making the material more dif\ufb01cult to machine. On the other hand, very low hardness can be detrimental to machining performance. For example, low carbon steel, which has relatively low hardness, is often too ductile to machine well. High ductility causes tearing of the metal as the chip is formed, resulting in poor \ufb01nish, and problems with chip disposal. Cold drawing is often used on low carbon bars to increase surface hardness and promote chip-breaking during cutting. \r\rA metal\u2019s chemistry has an important effect on properties; and in some cases, chemistry affects the wear mechanisms that act on the tool material. Through these relationships, chemistry affects machinability. Carbon content has a signi\ufb01 cant effect on the properties of steel. As carbon is increased, the strength and hardness of the steel increases; this reduces machining performance. Many alloying elements added to steel to enhance properties are detrimental to machinability. Chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten form carbides in steel, which increase tool wear and reduce machinability. Manganese and nickel add strength and toughness to steel, which reduce machinability. Certain elements can be added to steel to improve machining \rTABLE \u2022 23.1 Approximate values of Brinell hardness and typical machinability ratings for selected workmaterials. \r\rValues are estimated average values based on [1], [4], [5], [7], and other sources. Ratings represent relative cutting speeds for a given tool life (see Example 23.1). aMachinability ratings are often expressed as percents (index number  100%). bThe list of alloy steels is by no means complete. The table includes some of the more common alloys and indicates the range of machinability ratings among these steels. cThe machinability of aluminum varies widely. It is expressed here as MR  5.00, but the range is probably from 3.00 to 10.00 or more. dAluminum alloys, brasses, and bronzes also vary signi\ufb01cantly in machining performance. Different grades have different machinability ratings. For each case, we have attempted to reduce the variation to a single average value to indicate relative performance with other work materials. \rperformance, such as lead, sulfur, and phosphorus. The additives have the effect of reducing the coef\ufb01cient of friction between the tool and chip, thereby reducing forces, temperature, and built-up edge formation.

Steel alloys formulated to improve machinability are referred to as free machining steels (Section 6.2.3). \rSimilar relationships exist for other work materials.

Machining is often selected when tolerances are close, because it is more accurate than most other shape-making proc-esses.Table 23.2 indicates typical tolerances that can be achieved for most machining operations examined in Chapter 21.

On the other hand, newer machine tools can achieve closer tolerances than those listed. \rTighter tolerances usually mean higher costs. For example, if the product designer speci\ufb01es a tolerance of 0.10 mm on a hole diameter of 6.0 mm, this tolerance could be achieved by a drilling operation, according to Table 23.2. However, if the designer speci\ufb01es a tolerance of 0.025 mm, then an additional reaming operation is needed to satisfy this tighter requirement. This is not to suggest that looser tolerances are always good. It often happens that closer tolerances and lower variability in the machining of the individual components will lead to fewer problems in assembly, \ufb01nal product testing, \ufb01eld service, and customer acceptance. Although these costs are not always as easy to quantify as direct manufacturing costs, they can nevertheless be signi\ufb01cant. Tighter tolerances that push a factory to achieve better control over its manufacturing processes may lead to lower total operating costs for the company over the long run. \r\r23.2.2 SURFACE FINISH IN MACHINING \rBecause machining is often the manufacturing process that determines the \ufb01nal geometry and dimensions of the part, it is also the process that determines the part\u2019s surface texture (Section 5.3.2).

The shape of the tool point is the important tool geometry factor. The effects can be seen for a single-point tool in Figure 23.1.With the same feed,a larger nose radius causes the feed marks to be less pronounced, thus leading to a better \ufb01nish. If two feeds are compared with the same nose radius, the larger feed increases the separation between feed marks, leading to an increase in the value of ideal surface roughness. If feed rate is large enough and the nose radius is small enough so that the end cutting edge participates in creating the new surface, then the end cutting-edge angle will affect surface geometry.

Workpiece geometry can sometimes play a role in chatter. Thin cross sections tend to increase the likelihood of chatter, requiring additional supports to alleviate the condition. \r\r\r\r\r\r\rSelection of Cutting Conditions \rOne of the practical problems in machining is selecting the proper cutting conditions for a given operation. This is one of the tasks in process planning (Section 39.1). For each operation,decisions must be made about machine tool,cutting tool(s),and cutting conditions. These decisions must give due consideration to work part machinability, part geometry, surface \ufb01nish, and so forth. \r\r23.3.1 SELECTING FEED AND DEPTH OF CUT \rCutting conditions in a machining operation consist of speed, feed, depth of cut, and cutting \ufb02uid (whether a cutting \ufb02uid should be used and, if so, what type of cutting \ufb02uid).Tooling considerations are usually the dominant factor in decisions about cutting \ufb02uids (Section 22.4). Depth of cut is often predetermined by workpiece geometry and operation sequence. Many jobs require a series of roughing operations followed by a \ufb01nal \ufb01nishing operation. In the roughing operations, depth is made as large as possible within the limitations of available horsepower, machine tool and setup rigidity, strength of the cutting tool, and so on. In the \ufb01nishing cut, depth is set to achieve the \ufb01nal dimensions for the part. \r\rThe problem then reduces to selection of feed and speed. In general, values of these \rparameters should be decided in the order: feed \ufb01 rst, speed second. Determining the \rappropriate feed rate for a given machining operation depends on the following factors: \r\u27a2 \rTooling.What type of tooling will be used? Harder tool materials (e.g., cemented carbides, ceramics, etc.) tend to fracture more readily than high-speed steel. These tools are normally used at lower feed rates. HSS can tolerate higher feeds because of its greater toughness. \r\r\u27a2 \rRoughing or \ufb01 nishing. Roughing operations involve high feeds, typically 0.5 to \r\r1.25 mm/rev (0.020\u20130.050 in/rev) for turning; \ufb01nishing operations involve low feeds, typically 0.125 to 0.4 mm/rev (0.005\u20130.015 in/rev) for turning. \r\r\u27a2 \rConstraints on feed in roughing. If the operation is roughing, how high can the feed rate be set? To maximize metal removal rate, feed should be set as high as possible. Upper limits on feed are imposed by cutting forces, setup rigidity, and sometimes horsepower. \r\r\u27a2 \rSurface \ufb01nish requirements in \ufb01 nishing. If the operation is \ufb01nishing, what is the desired surface \ufb01nish? Feed is an important factor in surface \ufb01nish, and computations like those in Example 23.2 can be used to estimate the feed that will produce a desired surface \ufb01nish. \r\r\r\r23.3.2 OPTIMIZING CUTTING SPEED \rSelection of cutting speed is based on making the best use of the cutting tool, which normally means choosing a speed that provides a high metal removal rate yet suitably long tool life. Mathematical formulas have been derived to determine optimal cutting speed for a machining operation, given that the various time and cost components of the operation are known.

Mathematical formulas have been derived to determine optimal cutting speed for a machining operation, given that the various time and cost components of the operation are known. The original derivation of these machining economics equations is credited toW.Gilbert [10].The formulas allow the optimal cutting speed to be calculated for either of two objectives: (1) maximum production rate, or (2) minimum unit cost. Both objectives seek to achieve a balance between material removal rate and tool life. The formulas are based on a known Taylor Tool Life equation for the tool used in the operation.Accordingly,feed,depth of cut,and work material have already been set. The derivation will be illustrated for a turning operation. Similar derivations can be developed for other types of machining operations [3]. \rMaximizing Production Rate For maximum production rate, the speed that minimizes machining time per workpiece is determined. Minimizing cutting time per unit is equivalent to maximizing production rate.This objective is important in cases when the production order must be completed as quickly as possible. \rIn turning, there are three time elements that contribute to the total production cycle time for one part: \r1. \rPart handling time Th.This is the time the operator spends loading the part into the machine tool at the beginning of the production cycle and unloading the part after machining is completed. Any additional time required to reposition the tool for the start of the next cycle should also be included here. \r\r2. \rMachining time Tm.This is the time the tool is actually engaged in cutting metal during the cycle. \r\r\rFIGURE 23.3 \rTime elements in a machining cycle plottedas a function of cuttingspeed. Total cycle time per piece is minimizedat a certain value of cutting speed. This isthe speed for maximumproduction rate. \r\r3. Tool change time Tt.At the end of the tool life, the tool must be changed, which takes time. This time must be apportioned over the number of parts cut during the tool life. Let np ! the number of pieces cut in one tool life (the number of pieces cut with one cutting edge until the tool is changed); thus, the tool change time per part ! Tt /np. \rThe sum of these three time elements gives the total time per unit product for the operation cycle: \rTt\rTc ! Th & Tm & (23.3)\rnp \rwhere Tc  production cycle time per piece, min; and the other terms are de\ufb01 ned above. \rThe cycle time Tc is a function of cutting speed. As cutting speed is increased, Tm decreases and Tt /np increases; Th is unaffected by speed. These relationships are shown in Figure 23.3. \rThe cycle time per part is minimized at a certain value of cutting speed. This optimal speed can be identi\ufb01ed by recasting Equation (23.3) as a function of speed. Machining time in a straight turning operation is given by previous Equation (21.5): \r! pDL\rTm vf \rwhere Tm  machining time, min; D  work part diameter, mm (in); L ! work part length, mm (in); f  feed, mm/rev (in/rev); and v  cutting speed, mm/min for consistency of units (in/min for consistency of units). \rThe number of pieces per tool np is also a function of speed. It can be shown that \rnp ! TTm (23.4) \rwhere T ! tool life, min/tool; and Tm ! machining time per part, min/pc. Both T and Tm are functions of speed; hence, the ratio is a function of speed: \rfC1/n \rnp !

Let Co ! the cost rate (e.g., $/min) for the operator and machine. Thus the cost of part handling time ! CoTh. \r\r2. \rCost of machining time. This is the cost of the time the tool is engaged in machining. Using Co again to represent the cost per minute of the operator and machine tool, the cutting time cost ! CoTm. \r\r3. \rCost of tool change time. The cost of tool change time ! CoTt /np. \r\r4. \rTooling cost. In addition to the tool change time, the tool itself has a cost that must be added to the total operation cost. This cost is the cost per cutting edge Ct, divided by the number of pieces machined with that cutting edge np. Thus, tool cost per workpiece is given by Ct /np. \r\r\rTooling cost requires an explanation, because it is affected by different tooling situations. For disposable inserts (e.g., cemented carbide inserts), tool cost is determined as \rPt\rCt !

First, as the values of C and n increase in the Taylor tool life equation, the optimum cutting speed increases by either Equation (23.7) or Equation (23.13). Cemented carbides and ceramic cutting tools should be used at speeds that are signi\ufb01cantly higher than for high-speed steel tools. \rSecond, as the tool change time and/or tooling cost (Tt and Ct) increase, the cutting speed equations yield lower values. Lower speeds allow the tools to last longer, and it is wasteful to change tools too frequently if either the cost of tools or the time to change them is high. An important effect of this tool cost factor is that disposable inserts usually possess a substantial economic advantage over regrindable tooling. Even though the cost per insert is signi\ufb01cant, the number of edges per insert is large enough and the time required to change the cutting edge is low enough that disposable tooling generally achieves higher production rates and lower costs per unit product. \rThird, vmax is always greater than vmin. The Ct /np term in Equation (23.13) has the effect of pushing the optimum speed value to the left in Figure 23.4, resulting in a lower value than in Figure 23.3.Rather than taking the risk of cutting at a speed above vmax or below vmin, some machine shops strive to operate in the interval between vmin and vmax\u2014an interval sometimes referred to as the \u201chigh-ef\ufb01ciency range.\u201d \rThe procedures outlined for selecting feeds and speeds in machining are often dif\ufb01cult to apply in practice. The best feed rate is dif\ufb01cult to determine because the relationships between feed and surface \ufb01nish, force, horsepower, and other constraints are not readily available for each machine tool. Experience, judgment, and experimentation are required to select the proper feed.

Testing of this kind in a production environment is expensive. \r\r\r\r\r\rProduct Design Considerations in Machining \rSeveral important aspects of product design have already been considered in the discussion of tolerance and surface \ufb01nish (Section 23.2). In this section, some design guidelines for machining are presented, compiled from sources [1], [5], and [15]: \r\u27a2 \rIf possible, parts should be designed that do not need machining. If this is not possible, then minimize the amount of machining required on the parts. In general, a lower-cost product is achieved through the use of net shape processes such as precision casting, closed die forging, or (plastic) molding; or near net shape processes such as impression die forging. Reasons why machining may be required include close tolerances; good surface \ufb01 nish; and special geometric features such as threads, precision holes, cylindrical sections with high degree of roundness, and similar shapes that cannot be achieved except by machining. \r\r\u27a2 \rTolerances should be speci\ufb01ed to satisfy functional requirements, but process capabilities should also be considered. See Table 23.2 for tolerance capabilities in machining.Excessively close tolerances add cost but may not add value to the part. As tolerances become tighter (smaller), product costs generally increase because of additional processing, \ufb01xturing, inspection, sortation, rework, and scrap. \r\r\u27a2 \rSurface \ufb01nish should be speci\ufb01ed to meet functional and/or aesthetic requirements, but better \ufb01nishes generally increase processing costs by requiring additional operations such as grinding or lapping. \r\r\u27a2 \rMachined features such as sharp corners, edges, and points should be avoided; they are often dif\ufb01 cult to accomplish by machining. Sharp internal corners require pointed cutting tools that tend to break during machining. Sharp external corners and edges tend to create burrs and are dangerous to handle. \r\r\u27a2 \rDeep holes that must be bored should be avoided. Deep hole boring requires a long boring bar. Boring bars must be stiff, and this often requires use of high modulus materials such as cemented carbide, which is expensive. \r\r\u27a2 \rMachined parts should be designed so they can be produced from standard available stock. Choose exterior dimensions equal to or close to the standard stock size to minimize machining; for example, rotational parts with outside diameters that are equal to standard bar stock diameters. \r\r\u27a2 \rParts should be designed to be rigid enough to withstand forces of cutting and workholder clamping. Machining of long narrow parts, large \ufb02at parts, parts with thin walls, and similar shapes should be avoided if possible. \r\r\u27a2 \rUndercuts as in Figure 23.5 should be avoided because they often require additional setups and operations and/or special tooling; they can also lead to stress concentrations in service. \r\r\u27a2 \rMaterials with good machinability should be selected by the designer (Section 23.1). As a rough guide, the machinability rating of a material correlates with the allowable cutting speed and production rate that can be used. Thus, parts made of materials with low machinability cost more to produce. Parts that are hardened by heat treatment must usually be \ufb01nish ground or machined with higher cost tools after hardening to achieve \ufb01nal size and tolerance. \r\r\r(a) bracket and (b) rotational part.

Grinding is the most important abrasive process. In terms of number of machine tools in use, grinding is the most common of all metalworking operations [11]. Other traditional abrasive processes include honing, lapping, super\ufb01 nishing, polishing, and buff-ing.The abrasive machining processes are generally used as \ufb01nishing operations, although some abrasive processes are capable of high material removal rates rivaling those of conventional machining operations. \rThe use of abrasives to shape parts is probably the oldest material removal process (Historical Note 24.1). Abrasive processes are important commercially and technologically for the following reasons: \r\u27a2 \rThey can be used on all types of materials ranging from soft metals to hardened steels and hard nonmetallic materials such as ceramics and silicon. \r\r\u27a2 \rSome of these processes can produce extremely \ufb01ne surface \ufb01nishes, to 0.025 mm (1 m-in). \r\r\u27a2 \rFor certain abrasive processes, dimensions can be held to extremely close tolerances. \r\r\rAbrasive water jet cutting and ultrasonic machining are also abrasive processes, because material removal is accomplished by means of abrasives. However, they are commonly classi\ufb01ed as nontraditional processes and are covered in the Chapter 25. \r\r\r\r\r24.1 Grinding \rGrinding is a material removal process accomplished by abrasive particles that are contained in a bonded grinding wheel rotating at very high surface speeds.The grinding wheel is usually disk shaped, and is precisely balanced for high rotational speeds. \r\rHistorical Note 24.1 Development of abrasive processes \rUse of abrasives predates any of the other machining operations. There is archaeological evidence that ancient people used abrasive stones such as sandstone found in nature to sharpen tools and weapons and scrape away unwanted portions of softer materials to make domestic implements. \rGrinding became an important technical trade in ancient Egypt. The large stones used to build the Egyptian pyramids were cut to size by a rudimentary grinding process. The grinding of metals dates to around 2000 B.C.E. and was a highly valued skill at that time. \rEarly abrasive materials were those found in nature, such as sandstone, which consists primarily of quartz (SiO2); emery, consisting of corundum (Al2O3) plus equal or lesser amounts of the iron minerals hematite (Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4); and diamond. The \ufb01 rst grinding wheels were likely cut out of sandstone and were no doubt rotated under manual power. However, grinding wheels made in this way were not consistent in quality. \rIn the early 1800s, the \ufb01rst solid bonded grinding wheels were produced in India. They were used to grind gems, an important trade in India at the time. The abrasives were corundum, emery, or diamond. The bonding material was natural gum-resin shellac. The technology was exported to Europe and the United States, and other bonding materials were subsequently introduced: rubber bond in the mid-1800s, vitri\ufb01 ed bond around 1870, shellac bond around 1880, and resinoid bond in the 1920s with the development of the \ufb01 rst thermosetting plastics (phenol-formaldehyde). \rIn the late 1800s, synthetic abrasives were \ufb01 rst produced: silicon carbide (SiC) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3). By manufacturing the abrasives, chemistry and size of the individual abrasive grains could be controlled more closely, resulting in higher quality grinding wheels. \rThe \ufb01rst real grinding machines were made by the \rU.S. \ufb01rm Brown & Sharpe in the 1860s for grinding parts for sewing machines, an important industry during the period.

Grinding machines also contributed to the development of the bicycle industry in the 1890s and later the U.S. automobile industry. The grinding process was used to size and \ufb01nish heat-treated (hardened) parts in these products. \rThe superabrasives diamond and cubic boron nitride are products of the twentieth century. Synthetic diamonds were \ufb01 rst produced by the General Electric Company in 1955. These abrasives were used to grind cemented carbide cutting tools, and today this remains one of the important applications of diamond abrasives. Cubic boron nitride (cBN), second only to diamond in hardness, was \ufb01rst synthesized in 1957 by GE using a similar process to that for making arti\ufb01 cial diamonds. Cubic BN has become an important abrasive for grinding hardened steels. \r\r\rGrinding can be likened to the milling process. Cutting occurs on either the periphery or the face of the grinding wheel, similar to peripheral and face milling. Peripheral grinding is much more common than face grinding.The rotating grinding wheel consists of many cutting teeth (the abrasive particles), and the work is fed relative to the wheel to accomplish material removal. Despite these similarities, there are signi\ufb01cant differences between grinding and milling: (1) the abrasive grains in the wheel are much smaller and more numerous than the teeth on a milling cutter; \r(2) cutting speeds in grinding are much higher than in milling; (3) the abrasive grits in a grinding wheel are randomly oriented and possess on average a very high negative rake angle; and (4) a grinding wheel is self-sharpening\u2014as the wheel wears, the abrasive particles become dull and either fracture to create fresh cutting edges or are pulled out of the surface of the wheel to expose new grains. \r24.1.1 THE GRINDING WHEEL \rA grinding wheel consists of abrasive particles and bonding material. The bonding material holds the particles in place and establishes the shape and structure of the wheel. These two ingredients and the way they are fabricated determine the \ufb01ve \r(3)bonding ,(2)grainsize ,(1)abrasivematerial : basicparametersofagrindingwheel \rmaterial, (4) wheel grade, and (5) wheel structure. To achieve the desired performance in a given application, each parameter must be carefully selected. \rAbrasive Material Different abrasive materials are appropriate for grinding different work materials. General properties of an abrasive material used in grinding wheels include high hardness, wear resistance, toughness, and friability. Hardness, wear resistance, and toughness are desirable properties of any cutting-tool material. Friability refers to the capacity of the abrasive material to fracture when the cutting edge of the grain becomes dull, thereby exposing a new sharp edge. \rThe development of grinding abrasives is described in Historical Note 24.1. Today, the abrasive materials of greatest commercial importance are aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, cubic boron nitride, and diamond. They are brie\ufb02y described in Table 24.1, together with their relative hardness values. \rGrain Size The grain size of the abrasive particle is important in determining surface \ufb01nish and material removal rate. Small grit sizes produce better \ufb01nishes, whereas larger grain sizes permit larger material removal rates. Thus, a choice must be made between these two objectives when selecting abrasive grain size. The selection of grit size also depends to some extent on the hardness of the work material. Harder work materials require smaller grain sizes to cut effectively, whereas softer materials require larger grit sizes. \rThe grit size is measured using a screen mesh procedure, as explained in Section 15.1.

The selection of grit size also depends to some extent on the hardness of the work material. Harder work materials require smaller grain sizes to cut effectively, whereas softer materials require larger grit sizes. \rThe grit size is measured using a screen mesh procedure, as explained in Section 15.1. In this procedure, smaller grit sizes have larger numbers and vice versa. Grain sizes used in grinding wheels typically range between 8 and 250. Grit size 8 is very coarse and size 250 is very \ufb01ne. Even \ufb01ner grit sizes are used for lapping and super\ufb01nishing (Section 24.2). \rBonding Materials The bonding material holds the abrasive grains and establishes the shape and structural integrity of the grinding wheel. Desirable properties of the bond material include strength, toughness, hardness, and temperature resistance. \r\rTABLE \u2022 24.1 Abrasives of greatest importance in grinding. \r\rTABLE \u2022 24.2 Bonding materials used in grinding wheels. \r\rThe bonding material must be able to withstand the centrifugal forces and high temperatures experienced by the grinding wheel, resist shattering in shock loading of the wheel, and hold the abrasive grains rigidly in place to accomplish the cutting action while allowing those grains that are worn to be dislodged so that new grains can be exposed. Bonding materials commonly used in grinding wheels are identi\ufb01ed and brie\ufb02y described in Table 24.2. \rWheel Structure and Wheel Grade Wheel structure refers to the relative spacing of the abrasive grains in the wheel. In addition to the abrasive grains and bond material, grinding wheels contain air gaps or pores, as illustrated in Figure 24.1. The volumetric proportions of grains, bond material, and pores can be expressed as\r Pg  Pb  Pp  1.0 (24.1) \r\rwhere Pg \" proportion of abrasive grains in the total wheel volume, Pb \" proportion of bond material, and Pp  proportion of pores (air gaps). \rWheel structure is measured on a scale that ranges between \u201copen\u201d and \u201cdense.\u201d An open structure is one in which Pp is relatively large, and Pg is relatively small. That is, there are more pores and fewer grains per unit volume in a wheel of open structure. By contrast, a dense structure is one in which Pp is relatively small, and Pg is larger. Generally, open structures are recommended in situations in which clearance for chips must be provided. Dense structures are used to obtain better surface \ufb01nish and dimensional control. \r\rTABLE \u2022 24.3 Marking system for conventional grinding wheels as de\ufb01ned by ANSI Standard B74.13-1977 [2]. \r\rWheel grade indicates the grinding wheel\u2019s bond strength in retaining the abrasive grits during cutting. This is largely dependent on the amount of bonding material present in the wheel structure\u2014Pb in Equation (24.1).

Using surface grinding to illustrate, Figure 24.3(a) shows the principal features of the process. The peripheral speed of the grinding wheel is determined by the rotational speed of the wheel: \r\rv \" pDN (24.2) \rwhere v \" surface speed of wheel, m/min (ft/min); N \" spindle speed, rev/min; and D  wheel diameter, m (ft). \rDepth of cut d, called the infeed, is the penetration of the wheel below the original work surface. As the operation proceeds, the grinding wheel is fed laterally across the surface on each pass by the work. This is called the crossfeed, and it determines the width of the grinding path w in Figure 24.3(a). This width, multiplied by depth d determines the cross-sectional area of the cut. In most grinding operations, the work moves past the wheel at a certain speed vw, so that the material removal rate is\r RMR \" vwwd (24.3) \rEach grain in the grinding wheel cuts an individual chip whose longitudinal shape before cutting is shown in Figure 24.3(b) and whose assumed cross-sectional shape is triangular, as in Figure 24.3(c). At the exit point of the grit from the work, where the chip cross section is largest, this triangle has height t and width w. \rIn a grinding operation, one is interested in how the cutting conditions combine with the grinding wheel parameters to affect (1) surface \ufb01nish, (2) forces and energy, \r(3) temperature of the work surface, and (4) wheel wear. \rSurface Finish Most commercial grinding is performed to achieve a surface \ufb01nish that is superior to that which can be accomplished with conventional machining.The surface \ufb01nish of the work part is affected by the size of the individual chips formed during grinding. One obvious factor in determining chip size is grit size\u2014smaller grit sizes yield better \ufb01nishes. \r\rConsider the dimensions of an individual chip. From the geometry of the grinding process in Figure 24.3, it can be shown that the average length of a chip is given by \rlc \" Dd (24.4) \r\rwhere lc is the length of the chip, mm (in); D \" wheel diameter, mm (in); and d \" depth of cut, or infeed, mm (in). This assumes the chip is formed by a grit that acts throughout the entire sweep arc shown in the diagram. \rFigure 24.3(c) shows the assumed cross section of a chip in grinding. The cross-sectional shape is triangular with width w# being greater than the thickness t by a factor called the grain aspect ratio rg, de\ufb01ned by \rrg \" w# (24.5)\rt \r\rTypical values of grain aspect ratio are between 10 and 20. \rThe number of active grits (cutting teeth) per square inch on the outside periphery of the grinding wheel is denoted by C.

It stands to reason that surface \ufb01nish will be improved by increasing the number of chips formed per unit time on the work surface for a given width w. Therefore, according to Equation (24.6), increasing v and/or C will improve \ufb01nish. \rForces and Energy If the force required to drive the work past the grinding wheel were known, the speci\ufb01c energy in grinding could be determined as \rFcv\rU \" (24.7)\rvwwd \r\rwhere U \" speci\ufb01c energy, J/mm3 (in-lb/in3); Fc \" cutting force, which is the force to drive the work past the wheel, N (lb); v \" wheel speed, m/min (ft/min); vw \" work speed, mm/min (in/min); w  width of cut, mm (in); and d  depth of cut, mm (in). \rIn grinding, the speci\ufb01c energy is much greater than in conventional machining. There are several reasons for this. First is the size effect in machining.The chip thickness in grinding is much smaller than for other machining operations, such as milling. According to the size effect (Section 20.4), the small chip sizes in grinding cause the energy required to remove each unit volume of material to be signi\ufb01cantly higher than in conventional machining\u2014roughly 10 times higher. \rSecond, the individual grains in a grinding wheel possess extremely negative rake angles. The average rake angle is about 30\u00b0, with values on some individual grains believed to be as low as 60\u00b0. These very low rake angles result in low values of shear plane angle and high shear strains, both of which mean higher energy levels in grinding. \r\rThird, speci\ufb01c energy is higher in grinding because not all of the individual grits are engaged in actual cutting. Because of the random positions and orientations of the grains in the wheel, some grains do not project far enough into the work surface to accomplish cutting. Three types of grain actions can be recognized, as illustrated in Figure 24.4: (a) cutting, in which the grit projects far enough into the work surface to form a chip and remove material; (b) plowing, in which the grit projects into the work, but not far enough to cause cutting; instead, the work surface is deformed and energy is consumed without any material removal; and (c) rubbing, in which the grit contacts the surface during its sweep, but only rubbing friction occurs, thus consuming energy without removing any material. \rThe size effect, negative rake angles, and ineffective grain actions combine to \rmake the grinding process inef\ufb01cient in terms of energy consumption per volume of \rmaterial removed. \rUsing the speci\ufb01c energy relationship in Equation (24.7), and assuming that the \rcutting force acting on a single grain in the grinding wheel is proportional to rgt, it \rcan be shown [10] that \rrgvw 0.5 0.25 \r____ __d\rFc\" K1( )( ) (24.8)\rvC D \rwhere Fc# is the cutting force acting on an individual grain, K1 is a constant of proportionality that depends on the strength of the material being cut and the sharpness of the individual grain, and the other terms have been previously de\ufb01ned.

Referring back to the discussion on wheel grade, a hard wheel can be made to appear softer by increasing the cutting force acting on an individual grain through appropriate adjustments in vw, v, and d, according to Equation (24.8). \rTemperatures at the Work Surface Because of the size effect, high negative rake angles, and plowing and rubbing of the abrasive grits against the work surface, the grinding process is characterized by high temperatures. Unlike conventional machining operations in which most of the heat energy generated in the process is carried off in the chip, much of the energy in grinding remains in the ground surface [11], resulting in high work surface temperatures. The high surface temperatures have several possible damaging effects,primarily surface burns and cracks.The burn marks show themselves as discolorations on the surface caused by oxidation. Grinding burns are often a sign of metallurgical damage immediately beneath the surface. \r\rThe surface cracks are perpendicular to the wheel speed direction. They indicate an extreme case of thermal damage to the work surface. \rA second harmful thermal effect is softening of the work surface. Many grinding operations are carried out on parts that have been heat-treated to obtain high hardness. High grinding temperatures can cause the surface to lose some of its hardness. Third, thermal effects in grinding can cause residual stresses in the work surface, possibly decreasing the fatigue strength of the part. \rIt is important to understand what factors in\ufb02uence work surface temperatures in grinding. Experimentally, it has been observed that surface temperature is dependent on energy per surface area ground (closely related to speci\ufb01c energy U). Because this varies inversely with chip thickness, it can be shown that surface temperature Ts is related to grinding parameters as follows [10]: \rrgCv 0.5 \r\" K2d0.75 ____ D0.25\rTs ( vw ) (24.9) \r\rwhere K2  a constant of proportionality. The practical implication of this relationship is that surface damage caused by high work temperatures can be mitigated by decreasing depth of cut d, wheel speed v, and number of active grits per square inch on the grinding wheel C, or by increasing work speed vw. In addition, dull grinding wheels and wheels that have a hard grade and dense structure tend to cause thermal problems. Of course, using a cutting \ufb02uid can also reduce grinding temperatures. \rWheel Wear Grinding wheels wear,just as conventional cutting tools wear.Three mechanisms are recognized as the principal causes of wear in grinding wheels: (1) grain fracture, (2) attritious wear, and (3) bond fracture. Grain fracture occurs when a portion of the grain breaks off, but the rest of the grain remains bonded in the wheel. The edges of the fractured area become new cutting edges on the grinding wheel.The tendency of the grain to fracture is called friability. High friability means that the grains fracture more readily because of the cutting forces on the grains Fc. \rAttritious wear involves dulling of the individual grains, resulting in \ufb02at spots and rounded edges. Attritious wear is analogous to tool wear in a conventional cutting tool. It is caused by similar physical mechanisms including friction and diffusion, as well as chemical reactions between the abrasive material and the work material in the presence of very high temperatures. \rBond fracture occurs when the individual grains are pulled out of the bonding material. The tendency toward this mechanism depends on wheel grade, among other factors. Bond fracture usually occurs because the grain has become dull from attritious wear, and the resulting cutting force is excessive. Sharp grains cut more ef\ufb01ciently with lower cutting forces; hence, they remain attached in the bond structure. \rThe three mechanisms combine to cause the grinding wheel to wear as depicted in Figure 24.5.Three wear regions can be identi\ufb01ed.In the \ufb01rst region,the grains are initially sharp,and wear is accelerated because of grain fracture.This corresponds to the \u201cbreak-in\u201d period in conventional tool wear.

Sharp grains cut more ef\ufb01ciently with lower cutting forces; hence, they remain attached in the bond structure. \rThe three mechanisms combine to cause the grinding wheel to wear as depicted in Figure 24.5.Three wear regions can be identi\ufb01ed.In the \ufb01rst region,the grains are initially sharp,and wear is accelerated because of grain fracture.This corresponds to the \u201cbreak-in\u201d period in conventional tool wear. In the second region, the wear rate is fairly constant, resulting in a linear relationship between wheel wear and volume of metal removed. This region is characterized by attritious wear, with some grain and bond fracture. In the third region of the wheel wear curve, the grains become dull, and the amount of plowing and rubbing increases relative to cutting. In addition,some of the chips become clogged in the pores of the wheel.This is called wheel loading, and it impairs the cutting action and leads to higher heat and work surface \rFIGURE 24.5 Typical wear curve of a grinding wheel. Wear is conveniently plotted as a functionof volume of material removed, rather than as a function of time. (Based on [16].) \r\rtemperatures. As a consequence, grinding ef\ufb01ciency decreases, and the volume of wheel removed increases relative to the volume of metal removed. \rThe grinding ratio is a term used to indicate the slope of the wheel wear curve. Speci\ufb01cally, \rVw\rGR \" (24.10)\rVg \rwhere GR \" the grinding ratio, Vw \" the volume of work material removed, and Vg \" the corresponding volume of the grinding wheel that is worn in the process. The grinding ratio has the most signi\ufb01cance in the linear wear region of Figure 24.5. Typical values of GR range between 95 and 125 [5], which is about \ufb01ve orders of magnitude less than the analogous ratio in conventional machining. Grinding ratio is generally increased by increasing wheel speed v.The reason for this is that the size of the chip formed by each grit is smaller with higher speeds, so the amount of grain fracture is reduced. Because higher wheel speeds also improve surface \ufb01nish, there is a general advantage in operating at high grinding speeds. However, when speeds become too high, attritious wear and surface temperatures increase. As a result, the grinding ratio is reduced and the surface \ufb01nish is impaired.This effect was originally reported by Krabacher [14], as in Figure 24.6. \rWhen the wheel is in the third region of the wear curve, it must be resharpened by a procedure called dressing, which consists of (1) breaking off the dulled grits on the outside periphery of the grinding wheel in order to expose fresh sharp grains and (2) removing chips that have become clogged in the wheel. It is accomplished by a rotating disk, an abrasive stick, or another grinding wheel operating at high speed, held against the wheel being dressed as it rotates. Although dressing sharpens the wheel, it does not guarantee the shape of the wheel. Truing is an alternative procedure that not only sharpens the wheel, but also restores its cylindrical shape and insures that it is straight across its outside perimeter. The procedure uses a diamond-pointed tool (other types of truing tools are also used) that is fed slowly and precisely across the wheel as it rotates.A very light depth is taken (0.025 mm or less) against the wheel. \r\r\r\r24.1.3 APPLICATION CONSIDERATIONS IN GRINDING \rThis section attempts to bring together the previous discussion of wheel parameters and theoretical analysis of grinding and consider their practical application.

Reducing friction and removing heat from the process are the two common functions. In addition, washing away chips and reducing temperature of the work surface are very important in grinding. \rTypes of grinding \ufb02uids by chemistry include grinding oils and emulsi\ufb01ed oils. The grinding oils are derived from petroleum and other sources. These products are attractive because friction is such an important factor in grinding. However, they pose hazards in terms of \ufb01re and operator health, and their cost is high relative to emulsi\ufb01ed oils. In addition, their capacity to carry away heat is less than \ufb02uids based on water.Accordingly,mixtures of oil in water are most commonly recommended as grinding \ufb02uids. These are usually mixed with higher concentrations than emulsi\ufb01ed oils used as conventional cutting \ufb02uids. In this way, the friction reduction mechanism is emphasized. \r\r\r24.1.4 GRINDING OPERATIONS AND GRINDING MACHINES \rGrinding is traditionally used to \ufb01nish parts whose geometries have already been created by other operations. Accordingly, grinding machines have been developed to grind plain \ufb02at surfaces, external and internal cylinders, and contour shapes such as threads.The contour shapes are often created by special formed wheels that have the opposite of the desired contour to be imparted to the work. Grinding is also used in tool rooms to form the geometries on cutting tools. In addition to these traditional uses, applications of grinding are expanding to include more high speed, high material removal operations. The discussion of operations and machines in this section includes the following types: (1) surface grinding, (2) cylindrical grinding, (3) center-less grinding, (4) creep feed grinding, and (5) other grinding operations. \rSurface Grinding Surface grinding is normally used to grind plain \ufb02 at surfaces. It is performed using either the periphery of the grinding wheel or the \ufb02at face of the wheel. Because the work is normally held in a horizontal orientation, peripheral grinding is performed by rotating the wheel about a horizontal axis, and face grinding is performed by rotating the wheel about a vertical axis. In either case, the relative motion of the work part is achieved by reciprocating the work past the wheel or by rotating it. These possible combinations of wheel orientations and work part motions provide the four types of surface grinding machines illustrated in Figure 24.7. \rOf the four types, the horizontal spindle machine with reciprocating worktable is the most common, shown in Figure 24.8. Grinding is accomplished by reciprocating the work longitudinally under the wheel at a very small depth (infeed) and by feeding the wheel transversely into the work a certain distance between strokes. In these operations, the width of the wheel is usually less than that of the workpiece. \rIn addition to its conventional application, a grinding machine with horizontal spindle and reciprocating table can be used to form special contoured surfaces by employing a formed grinding wheel. Instead of feeding the wheel transversely across the work as it reciprocates, the wheel is plunge-fed vertically into the work. The shape of the formed wheel is therefore imparted to the work surface. \rGrinding machines with vertical spindles and reciprocating tables are set up so that the wheel diameter is greater than the work width. Accordingly, these operations can be performed without using a transverse feed motion. Instead, grinding is accomplished by reciprocating the work past the wheel, and feeding the wheel \r\r\r(a) horizontal spindlewith reciprocatingworktable, (b) horizontalspindle with rotatingworktable, (c) verticalspindle with reciprocating worktable, and (d) vertical spindle with rotatingworktable. \rvertically into the work to the desired dimension.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 25484, "end_char_idx": 30098, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb91ea20-0c37-43dc-957f-727c4bc5f98d": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb91ea20-0c37-43dc-957f-727c4bc5f98d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec24.txt", "file_name": "sec24.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48662, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94d4e16d-10e4-405e-ad2f-78bebc15ad99", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec24.txt", "file_name": "sec24.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48662, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "7f72126b4a29a187cac961b4f8edc772812cb006604565a4554afef17e94b8fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a61b2d55-7f11-4bf8-96a5-3163fb046b57", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec24.txt", "file_name": "sec24.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48662, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "3e1839ae369a0864a2324e109187fef4003171580ab6f390547277e329b8ab86", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ae4eb719-a474-429c-952e-53a65cdac8aa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b0c945e35301fc14520e4c5fc28d0e28b7c5dc20be6c5bdbcd19bfb760e3fb0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Instead of feeding the wheel transversely across the work as it reciprocates, the wheel is plunge-fed vertically into the work.

This con\ufb01guration is capable of achieving a very \ufb02at surface on the work. \rOf the two types of rotary table grinding in Figure 24.7(b) and (d), the vertical spindle machines are more common. Owing to the relatively large surface contact area between wheel and work part, vertical spindle-rotary table grinding machines are capable of high metal removal rates when equipped with appropriate grinding wheels. \r\r\rCylindrical Grinding As its name suggests, cylindrical grinding is used for rotational parts. These grinding operations divide into two basic types, Figure 24.9: \r(a) external cylindrical grinding and (b) internal cylindrical grinding. \rExternal cylindrical grinding (also called center-type grinding to distinguish it from centerless grinding) is performed much like a turning operation.The grinding machines used for these operations closely resemble a lathe in which the tool post has been replaced by a high-speed motor to rotate the grinding wheel.The cylindrical workpiece is rotated between centers to provide a surface speed of 18\u201330 m/min (60\u2013100 ft/min) [16], and the grinding wheel, rotating at 1200\u20132000 m/min (4000\u20136500 ft/min), is engaged to perform the cut.There are two types of feed motion possible,traverse feed and plunge-cut, shown in Figure 24.10. In traverse feed, the grinding wheel is fed in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation of the work part. The infeed is set within a rangetypicallyfrom0.0075to0.075mm(0.0003\u20130.003in).A longitudinalreciprocating motion is sometimes given to either the work or the wheel to improve surface \ufb01 nish. In plunge-cut, the grinding wheel is fed radially into the work. Formed grinding wheels use this type of feed motion. \rExternal cylindrical grinding is used to \ufb01nish parts that have been machined to approximate size and heat treated to desired hardness. The parts include axles, crankshafts, spindles, bearings and bushings, and rolls for rolling mills. The grinding operation produces the \ufb01nal size and required surface \ufb01nish on these hardened parts. \r\r\rInternal cylindrical grinding operates somewhat like a boring operation. The workpiece is usually held in a chuck and rotated to provide surface speeds of 20 to 60 m/min (75\u2013200 ft/min) [16]. Wheel surface speeds similar to external cylindrical grinding are used. The wheel is fed in either of two ways: traverse feed, Figure 24.9(b), or plunge feed. Obviously, the wheel diameter in internal cylindrical grinding must be smaller than the original bore hole. This often means that the wheel diameter is quite small, necessitating very high rotational speeds in order to achieve the desired surface speed. Internal cylindrical grinding is used to \ufb01nish the hardened inside surfaces of bearing races and bushing surfaces. \rCenterless Grinding Centerless grinding is an alternative process for grinding external and internal cylindrical surfaces. As its name suggests, the workpiece is not held between centers. This results in a reduction in work handling time; hence, centerless grinding is often used for high-production work. The setup for external centerless grinding (Figure 24.11), consists of two wheels: the grinding wheel and a regulating wheel.The work parts,which may be many individual short pieces or long rods (e.g., 3\u20134 m long), are supported by a rest blade and fed through between the two wheels.The grinding wheel does the cutting,rotating at surface speeds of 1200 to 1800 m/min (4000\u20136000 ft/min).

As its name suggests, the workpiece is not held between centers. This results in a reduction in work handling time; hence, centerless grinding is often used for high-production work. The setup for external centerless grinding (Figure 24.11), consists of two wheels: the grinding wheel and a regulating wheel.The work parts,which may be many individual short pieces or long rods (e.g., 3\u20134 m long), are supported by a rest blade and fed through between the two wheels.The grinding wheel does the cutting,rotating at surface speeds of 1200 to 1800 m/min (4000\u20136000 ft/min). The regulating wheel rotates at much lower speeds and is inclined at a slight angle I to control throughfeed of the work. The following equation can be used to predict throughfeed rate, based on inclination angle and other parameters of the process [16]:\r fr \" p Dr Nr sin I (24.11) \r\rwhere fr \" throughfeed rate, mm/min (in/min); Dr \" diameter of the regulating wheel, mm (in); Nr  rotational speed of the regulating wheel, rev/min; and I  inclination angle of the regulating wheel. \rThe typical setup in internal centerless grinding is shown in Figure 24.12. In place of the rest blade, two support rolls are used to maintain the position of the work. The regulating wheel is tilted at a small inclination angle to control the feed of the work past the grinding wheel. Because of the need to support the grinding wheel, throughfeed of the work as in external centerless grinding is not possible. Therefore this grinding operation cannot achieve the same high-production rates as in the external centerless process. Its advantage is that it is capable of providing very close concentricity between internal and external diameters on a tubular part such as a roller bearing race. \r\r\rCreep Feed Grinding A relatively new form of grinding is creep feed grinding, developed around 1958. Creep feed grinding is performed at very high depths of cut and very low feed rates; hence, the name creep feed. The comparison with conventional surface grinding is illustrated in Figure 24.13. \rDepths of cut in creep feed grinding are 1000 to 10,000 times greater than in conventional surface grinding, and the feed rates are reduced by about the same proportion. However, material removal rate and productivity are increased in creep feed grinding because the wheel is continuously cutting. This contrasts with conventional surface grinding in which the reciprocating motion of the work results in signi\ufb01cant lost time during each stroke. \rCreep feed grinding can be applied in both surface grinding and external cylindrical grinding. Surface grinding applications include grinding of slots and pro\ufb01les. The process seems especially suited to those cases in which depth-to-width ratios are relatively large.The cylindrical applications include threads,formed gear shapes,and other cylindrical components. The term deep grinding is used in Europe to describe these external cylindrical creep feed grinding applications. \rThe introduction of grinding machines designed with special features for creep feed grinding has spurred interest in the process.The features include [11] high static and dynamic stability, highly accurate slides, two to three times the spindle power of conventional grinding machines, consistent table speeds for low feeds, high-pressure grinding \ufb02uid delivery systems, and dressing systems capable of dressing the grinding wheels during the process.Typical advantages of creep feed grinding include (1) high material removal rates, (2) improved accuracy for formed surfaces, and (3) reduced temperatures at the work surface. \r\r\rOther Grinding Operations Several other grinding operations should be brie\ufb02y mentioned to complete the survey. These include tool grinding, jig grinding, disk grinding, snag grinding, and abrasive belt grinding. \rCutting tools are made of hardened tool steel and other hard materials. Tool grinders are special grinding machines of various designs to sharpen and recondition cutting tools. They have devices for positioning and orienting the tools to grind the desired surfaces at speci\ufb01ed angles and radii.

These include tool grinding, jig grinding, disk grinding, snag grinding, and abrasive belt grinding. \rCutting tools are made of hardened tool steel and other hard materials. Tool grinders are special grinding machines of various designs to sharpen and recondition cutting tools. They have devices for positioning and orienting the tools to grind the desired surfaces at speci\ufb01ed angles and radii. Some tool grinders are general purpose while others cut the unique geometries of speci\ufb01c tool types. General-purpose tool and cutter grinders use special attachments and adjustments to accommodate a \rmilling cutter grinders of various types, broach sharpeners, and drill point grinders. \rJig grinders are grinding machines traditionally used to grind holes in hardened steel parts to high accuracies. The original applications included pressworking dies and tools. Although these applications are still important, jig grinders are used today in a broader range of applications in which high accuracy and good \ufb01nish are required on hardened components. Numerical control is available on modern jig grinding machines to achieve automated operation. \rDisk grinders are grinding machines with large abrasive disks mounted on either end of a horizontal spindle as in Figure 24.14. The work is held (usually manually) against the \ufb02at surface of the wheel to accomplish the grinding operation. Some disk grinding machines have double opposing spindles. By setting the disks at the desired separation, the work part can be fed automatically between the two disks and ground simultaneously on opposite sides. Advantages of the disk grinder are good \ufb02atness and parallelism at high production rates. \rThe snag grinder is similar in con\ufb01guration to a disk grinder.The difference is that the grinding is done on the outside periphery of the wheel rather than on the side \ufb02at surface.The grinding wheels are therefore different in design than those in disk grinding. Snag grinding is generally a manual operation, used for rough grinding operations such as removing the \ufb02ash from castings and forgings, and smoothing weld joints. \r,Single-purposetoolgrindersincludegearcuttersharpeners . varietyoftoolgeometries \r\r\rAbrasive belt grinding uses abrasive particles bonded to a \ufb02exible (cloth) belt. A typical setup is illustrated in Figure 24.15. Support of the belt is required when the work is pressed against it, and this support is provided by a roll or platen located behind the belt.A \ufb02at platen is used for work that will have a \ufb02at surface.A soft platen can be used if it is desirable for the abrasive belt to conform to the general contour of the part during grinding. Belt speed depends on the material being ground; a range of 750 to 1700 m/min (2500\u20135500 ft/min) is typical [16]. Owing to improvements in abrasives and bonding materials, abrasive belt grinding is being used increasingly for heavy stock removal rates, rather than light grinding, which was its traditional application.The term belt sanding refers to the light grinding applications in which the work part is pressed against the belt to remove burrs and high spots, and to produce an improved \ufb01nish quickly by hand. \r\rRelated Abrasive Processes \rOther abrasive processes include honing, lapping, super\ufb01nishing, polishing, and buff-ing.They are used exclusively as \ufb01nishing operations.The initial part shape is created by some other process; then the part is \ufb01nished by one of these operations to achieve superior surface \ufb01nish.

A common application is to \ufb01nish the bores of internal combustion engines. Other applications include bearings, hydraulic cylinders, and gun barrels. Surface \ufb01nishes of around 0.12 mm (5 m-in) or slightly better are typically achieved in these applications. In addition, honing produces a characteristic cross-hatched surface that tends to retain lubrication during operation of the component, thus contributing to its function and service life. \rThe honing process for an internal cylindrical surface is illustrated in Figure 24.16. The honing tool consists of a set of bonded abrasive sticks. Four sticks are used on the tool shown in the \ufb01gure,but the number depends on hole size.Two to four sticks would be used for small holes (e.g., gun barrels), and a dozen or more would be used for larger diameter holes.The motion of the honing tool is a combination of rotation and linear reciprocation, regulated in such a way that a given point on the abrasive stick does not trace the same path repeatedly. This rather complex motion accounts for the cross-hatched pattern on the bore surface. Honing speeds are 15 to 150 m/ min (50\u2013500 ft/min) [3]. During the process, the sticks are pressed outward against the hole surface to produce the desired abrasive cutting action. Hone pressures of 1 to 3 MPa (150\u2013450 lb/in2) are typical. The honing tool is supported in the hole by two universal joints, thus causing the tool to follow the previously de\ufb01ned hole axis. Honing enlarges and \ufb01nishes the hole but cannot change its location. \rGrit sizes in honing range between 30 and 600.The same trade-off between better \ufb01nish and faster material removal rates exists in honing as in grinding. The amount of material removed from the work surface during a honing operation may be as much as 0.5 mm (0.020 in), but is usually much less than this. A cutting \ufb02uid must be used in honing to cool and lubricate the tool and to help remove the chips. \rFIGURE 24.16 The honing process: (a) thehoning tool used forinternal bore surface, and (b) cross-hatchedsurface pattern createdby the action of thehoning tool. \r\rSection 24.2/Related Abrasive Processes  673  \r24.2.2  LAPPING  \rLapping is an abrasive process used to produce surface \ufb01nishes of extreme accuracy  \rand smoothness. It is used in the production of optical lenses, metallic bearing sur \rfaces, gages, and other parts requiring very good \ufb01nishes. Metal parts that are subject  \rto fatigue loading or surfaces that must be used to establish a seal with a mating part  \rare often lapped.  \rInstead of a bonded abrasive tool, lapping uses a \ufb02uid suspension of very small  \rabrasive particles between the workpiece and the lapping tool. The process is illus \rtrated in Figure 24.17 as applied in lens-making. The \ufb02uid with abrasives is referred  \rto as the lapping compound and has the general appearance of a chalky paste.

Lapping is sometimes performed by hand,  \rbut lapping machines accomplish the process with greater consistency and ef\ufb01ciency.  \rMaterials used to make the lap range from steel and cast iron to copper and lead.  \rWood laps have also been made. Because a lapping compound is used rather than  \ra bonded abrasive tool, the mechanism by which this process works is somewhat  \rdifferent than grinding and honing. It is hypothesized that two alternative cutting  \rmechanisms are at work in lapping [3]. The \ufb01rst mechanism is that the abrasive par \rticles roll and slide between the lap and the work, with very small cuts occurring in  \rboth surfaces. The second mechanism is that the abrasives become imbedded in the  \rlap surface and the cutting action is very similar to grinding. It is likely that lapping  \ris a combination of these two mechanisms, depending on the relative hardnesses of  \rthe work and the lap. For laps made of soft materials, the embedded grit mechanism  \ris emphasized; and for hard laps, the rolling and sliding mechanism dominates.  \r24.2.3  SUPERFINISHING  \r\rSuper\ufb01 nishing is an abrasive process similar to honing. Both processes use a bonded abrasive stick moved with a reciprocating motion and pressed against the surface to be \ufb01 nished. Super\ufb01nishing differs from honing in the following respects [4]: (1) the strokes are shorter, 5 mm (3/16 in); (2) higher frequencies are used, up to 1500 strokes per minute; (3) lower pressures are applied between the tool and the surface, below 0.28 MPa (40 lb/in2); (4) workpiece speeds are lower, 15 m/min (50 ft/min) or less; and (5) grit sizes are generally smaller. The relative motion between the abrasive stick and the work surface is varied so that individual grains do not retrace the same path. A cutting \ufb02uid is used to cool the work surface and \r\r\rFIGURE 24.18 \rSuper\ufb01nishing on an external cylindricalsurface. \r\r\rwash away chips. In addition, the \ufb02uid tends to separate the abrasive stick from the work surface after a certain level of smoothness is achieved, thus preventing further cutting action. The result of these operating conditions is mirror-like \ufb01 nishes with surface roughness values around 0.025 mm (1 m-in). Super\ufb01nishing can be used to \ufb01 nish \ufb02at and external cylindrical surfaces. The process is illustrated in Figure 24.18 for the latter geometry. \r\r24.2.4 POLISHING AND BUFFING \rPolishing is used to remove scratches and burrs and to smooth rough surfaces by means of abrasive grains attached to a polishing wheel rotating at high speed\u2014 around 2300 m/min (7500 ft/min). The wheels are made of canvas, leather, felt, and even paper; thus, the wheels are somewhat \ufb02exible. The abrasive grains are glued to the outside periphery of the wheel. After the abrasives have been worn down and used up, the wheel is replenished with new grits. Grit sizes of 20 to 80 are used for rough polishing, 90 to 120 for \ufb01nish polishing, and above 120 for \ufb01ne \ufb01nishing.

In addition to these conventional methods, there is a group of processes that uses other mechanisms to remove material. The term nontraditional machining refers to this group that removes excess material by various techniques involving mechanical, thermal, electrical, or chemical energy (or combinations of these energies). They do not use a sharp cutting tool in the conventional sense. \rThe nontraditional processes have been developed since World War II largely in response to new and unusual machining requirements that could not be satis\ufb01ed by conventional methods. These requirements, and the resulting commercial and technological importance of the nontraditional processes, include: \r\u27a2 \rThe need to machine newly developed metals and nonmetals. These new materials often have special properties (e.g., high strength, high hardness, high toughness) that make them dif\ufb01cult or impossible to machine by conventional methods. \r\r\u27a2 \rThe need for unusual and/or complex part geometries that cannot easily be accomplished and in some cases are impossible to achieve by conventional machining. \r\r\u27a2 \rThe need to avoid surface damage that often accompanies the stresses created by conventional machining. \r\r\rMany of these requirements are associated with the aerospace and electronics industries, which have become increasingly important in recent decades. \r\rThere are literally dozens of nontraditional machining processes, most of which are unique in their range of applications. In the present chapter, the most important are discussed. More detailed discussions of these nontraditional methods are presented in several of the references. \rThe nontraditional processes are often classi\ufb01ed according to principal form \rof energy used to effect material removal. By this classi\ufb01cation, there are four \rtypes: \r1. \rMechanical. Mechanical energy in some form other than the action of a conventional cutting tool is used in these nontraditional processes. Erosion of the work material by a high velocity stream of abrasives or \ufb02uid (or both) is a typical form of mechanical action in these processes. \r\r2. \rElectrical. These nontraditional processes use electrochemical energy to remove material; the mechanism is the reverse of electroplating. \r\r3. \rThermal.These processes use thermal energy to cut or shape the work part.The thermal energy is generally applied to a very small portion of the work surface, causing that portion to be removed by fusion and/or vaporization. The thermal energy is generated by the conversion of electrical energy. \r\r4. \rChemical. Most materials (metals particularly) are susceptible to chemical attack by certain acids or other etchants. In chemical machining, chemicals selectively remove material from portions of the work part, while other portions of the surface are protected by a mask. \r\r\r\r\r\r\rMechanical Energy Processes \rThis section examines several of the nontraditional processes that use mechanical energy other than a sharp cutting tool: (1) ultrasonic machining, (2) water jet processes, and (3) other abrasive processes. \r\r25.1.1 ULTRASONIC MACHINING \rUltrasonic machining (USM) is a nontraditional machining process in which abrasives contained in a slurry are driven at high velocity against the work by a tool vibrating at low amplitude and high frequency.

The amplitudes are around 0.075 mm (0.003 in), and the frequencies are approximately 20,000 Hz. The tool oscillates in a direction perpendicular to the work surface, and is fed slowly into the work, so that the shape of the tool is formed in the part. However, it is the action of the abrasives, impinging against the work surface, that performs the cutting. The general arrangement of the USM process is depicted in Figure 25.1. \rCommon tool materials used in USM include soft steel and stainless steel.Abrasive materials in USM include boron nitride,boron carbide,aluminum oxide,silicon carbide, and diamond. Grit size (Section 16.1.1) ranges between 100 and 2000. The vibration amplitude should be set approximately equal to the grit size, and the gap size should be maintained at about two times grit size.To a signi\ufb01cant degree,grit size determines the surface \ufb01nish on the new work surface. In addition to surface \ufb01nish, material removal rate is an important performance variable in ultrasonic machining. For a given work material, the removal rate in USM increases with increasing frequency and amplitude of vibration. \r\r\rThe cutting action in USM operates on the tool as well as the work.As the abrasive particles erode the work surface, they also erode the tool, thus affecting its shape. It is therefore important to know the relative volumes of work material and tool material removed during the process\u2014similar to the grinding ratio (Section 25.1.2). This ratio of stock removed to tool wear varies for different work materials, ranging from around \r100:1 for cutting glass down to about 1:1 for cutting tool steel. \rThe slurry in USM consists of a mixture of water and abrasive particles. Concentrationofabrasivesinwaterrangesfrom20%to60%[5].The slurrymustbecontinuously circulated to bring fresh grains into action at the tool\u2013work gap. It also washes away chips and worn grits created by the cutting process. \rThe development of ultrasonic machining was motivated by the need to machine hard, brittle work materials, such as ceramics, glass, and carbides. It is also successfully used on certain metals such as stainless steel and titanium. Shapes obtained by USM include nonround holes, holes along a curved axis, and coining operations, in which an image pattern on the tool is imparted to a \ufb02at work surface. \r\r25.1.2 PROCESSES USING WATER JETS \rThe two processes described in this section remove material by means of high-velocity streams of water or a combination of water and abrasives. \rWater Jet Cutting Water jet cutting (WJC) uses a \ufb01ne, high-pressure, high-velocity stream of water directed at the work surface to cause cutting of the work, as illustrated in Figure 25.2. To obtain the \ufb01ne stream of water a small nozzle opening of diameter 0.1 to 0.4 mm (0.004\u20130.016 in) is used. To provide the stream with suf\ufb01cient energy for cutting, pressures up to 400 MPa (60,000 lb/in2) are used, and the jet reaches velocities up to 900 m/s (3000 ft/sec). The \ufb02uid is pressurized to the desired level by a hydraulic pump.The nozzle unit consists of a holder made of stainless steel, and a jewel nozzle made of sapphire, ruby, or diamond. Diamond lasts the longest but costs the most. Filtration systems must be used in WJC to separate the swarf produced during cutting. \rCutting \ufb02uids in WJC are polymer solutions, preferred because of their tendency to produce a coherent stream.

Diamond lasts the longest but costs the most. Filtration systems must be used in WJC to separate the swarf produced during cutting. \rCutting \ufb02uids in WJC are polymer solutions, preferred because of their tendency to produce a coherent stream. Cutting \ufb02uids have been discussed before in the context of conventional machining (Section 22.4), but never has the term been more appropriately applied than in WJC. \r\rImportant process parameters include standoff distance, nozzle opening diameter, water pressure,and cutting feed rate.As in Figure 25.2,the standoff distance is the separation between the nozzle opening and the work surface. It is generally desirable for this distance to be small to minimize dispersion of the \ufb02uid stream before it strikes the surface.A typical standoff distance is 3.2 mm (0.125 in).Size of the nozzle ori\ufb01ce affects the precision of the cut;smaller openings are used for \ufb01ner cuts on thinner materials.To cut thicker stock,thicker jet streams and higher pressures are required.The cutting feed rate refers to the velocity at which the WJC nozzle is traversed along the cutting path. Typical feed rates range from 5 mm/s (12 in/min) to more than 500 mm/s (1200 in/min), depending on work material and its thickness [5].TheWJC process is usually automated using computer numerical control or industrial robots to manipulate the nozzle unit along the desired trajectory. \rWater jet cutting can be used effectively to cut narrow slits in \ufb02at stock such as plastic, textiles, composites, \ufb02oor tile, carpet, leather, and cardboard. Robotic cells have been installed with WJC nozzles mounted as the robot\u2019s tool to follow cutting patterns that are irregular in three dimensions, such as cutting and trimming of automobile dashboards before assembly [9]. In these applications, advantages of WJC include (1) no crushing or burning of the work surface typical in other mechanical or thermal processes, (2) minimum material loss because of the narrow cut slit, (3) no environmental pollution, and (4) ease of automating the process. A limitation of WJC is that the process is not suitable for cutting brittle materials (e.g., glass) because of their tendency to crack during cutting. \rAbrasive Water Jet Cutting When WJC is used on metallic work parts, abrasive particles must usually be added to the jet stream to facilitate cutting. This process is therefore called abrasive water jet cutting (AWJC). Introduction of abrasive particles into the stream complicates the process by adding to the number of parameters that must be controlled. Among the additional parameters are abrasive type, grit size, and \ufb02ow rate. Aluminum oxide, silicon dioxide, and garnet (a silicate mineral) are typical abrasive materials,at grit sizes ranging between 60 and 120.The abrasive particles are added to the water stream at approximately 0.25 kg/min (0.5 lb/min) after it has exited the WJC nozzle. \r\rThe remaining process parameters include those that are common to WJC: nozzle opening diameter, water pressure, and standoff distance. Nozzle ori\ufb01ce diameters are 0.25 to 0.63 mm (0.010\u20130.025 in)\u2014somewhat larger than in water jet cutting to permit higher \ufb02ow rates and more energy to be contained in the stream before injection of abrasives. Water pressures are about the same as in WJC. Standoff distances are somewhat less to minimize the effect of dispersion of the cutting \ufb02uid that now contains abrasive particles. Typical standoff distances are between 1/4 and 1/2 of those in WJC. \r\r25.1.3 OTHER NONTRADITIONAL ABRASIVE PROCESSES \rTwo additional mechanical energy processes use abrasives to accomplish deburring, polishing, or other operations in which very little material is removed. \rAbrasive Jet Machining Not to be confused with AWJC is the process called abrasive jet machining (AJM), a material removal process caused by the action of a high-velocity stream of gas containing small abrasive particles, as in Figure 25.3.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6932, "end_char_idx": 11223, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "428f920a-2c46-4308-adb0-0d416382e50d": {"__data__": {"id_": "428f920a-2c46-4308-adb0-0d416382e50d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec25.txt", "file_name": "sec25.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 60503, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d74a8bd8-94fc-4b0a-8a0f-1db417357774", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec25.txt", "file_name": "sec25.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 60503, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "53a68db97d4754b8a10d77956e0985a52bd0ddccb8a15a80d0ed23f25ac9b1d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe407a6f-f292-434f-b7a6-9fd86dbea8cc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec25.txt", "file_name": "sec25.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 60503, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "a96ccc2a08065918d7863760f21d17246b22ad91773cfb775ab0ae63482245c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e79cd0c8-4251-434a-9197-ebf07701865a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d18c34556cf2f76468fa5610aa104f14074bdffa09b0103b3362638862ee1799", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Water pressures are about the same as in WJC.

Typical standoff distances are between 1/4 and 1/2 of those in WJC. \r\r25.1.3 OTHER NONTRADITIONAL ABRASIVE PROCESSES \rTwo additional mechanical energy processes use abrasives to accomplish deburring, polishing, or other operations in which very little material is removed. \rAbrasive Jet Machining Not to be confused with AWJC is the process called abrasive jet machining (AJM), a material removal process caused by the action of a high-velocity stream of gas containing small abrasive particles, as in Figure 25.3. The gas is dry, and pressures of 0.2 to 1.4 MPa (25\u2013200 lb/in2) are used to propel it through nozzle ori\ufb01ces of diameter 0.075 to 1.0 mm (0.003\u20130.040 in) at velocities of 2.5 to 5.0 m/s (500\u20131000 ft/min). Gases include dry air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and helium. \rThe process is usually performed manually by an operator who directs the nozzle at the work. Typical distances between nozzle tip and work surface range from 3 to 75 mm (0.125\u20133 in). The workstation must be set up to provide proper ventilation for the operator. \rAJM is normally used as a \ufb01nishing process rather than a production cutting process. Applications include deburring, trimming and de\ufb02ashing, cleaning, and polishing. Cutting is accomplished successfully on hard, brittle materials (e.g., glass, silicon, mica, and ceramics) that are in the form of thin \ufb02at stock. Typical abrasives used in AJM include aluminum oxide (for aluminum and brass), silicon carbide (for stainless steel and ceramics), and glass beads (for polishing). Grit sizes are small, 15 to 40 mm (0.0006\u20130.0016 in) in diameter, and must be uniform in size for a given application. It is important not to recycle the abrasives because used grains become fractured (and therefore smaller in size), worn, and contaminated. \rAbrasive Flow Machining This process was developed in the 1960s to deburr and polish dif\ufb01cult-to-reach areas using abrasive particles mixed in a viscoelastic polymer that is forced to \ufb02ow through or around the part surfaces and edges. The polymer has the consistency of putty. Silicon carbide is a typical abrasive. Abrasive \ufb02ow machining (AFM) is particularly well-suited for internal passageways that are often inaccessible by conventional methods. The abrasive-polymer mixture, called the media, \ufb02ows past the target regions of the part under pressures ranging from 0.7 to 20 MPa (100\u20133000 lb/in2). In addition to deburring and polishing,otherAFM applications include forming radii on sharp edges,removing rough surfaces on castings,and other \ufb01nishing operations.These applications are found in industries such as aerospace,automotive,and die-making.The process can be automated to economically \ufb01nish hundreds of parts per hour. \r\rA common setup is to position the work part between two opposing cylinders, one containing media and the other empty. The media is forced to \ufb02 ow through the part from the \ufb01rst cylinder to the other, and then back again, as many times as necessary to achieve the desired material removal and \ufb01 nish. \r\r\r\r\rElectrochemical Machining Processes \rAn important group of nontraditional processes use electrical energy to remove material. This group is identi\ufb01ed by the term electrochemical processes, because electrical energy is used in combination with chemical reactions to accomplish material removal. In effect, these processes are the reverse of electroplating (Section 27.3.1).

This group is identi\ufb01ed by the term electrochemical processes, because electrical energy is used in combination with chemical reactions to accomplish material removal. In effect, these processes are the reverse of electroplating (Section 27.3.1). The work material must be a conductor in the electrochemical machining processes. \r\r25.2.1 ELECTROCHEMICAL MACHINING \rThe basic process in this group is electrochemical machining (ECM). Electrochemical machining removes metal from an electrically conductive workpiece by anodic dissolution, in which the shape of the workpiece is obtained by a formed electrode tool in close proximity to, but separated from, the work by a rapidly \ufb02owing electrolyte. ECM is basically a deplating operation. As illustrated in Figure 25.4, the workpiece is the anode,and thetoolisthecathode.Theprincipleunderlying theprocess isthat material is deplated from the anode (the positive pole) and deposited onto the cathode (the negative pole) in the presence of an electrolyte bath (Section 4.5). The difference in ECM is that the electrolyte bath \ufb02ows rapidly between the two poles to carry off the deplated material, so that it does not become plated onto the tool. \r\r\rThe electrode tool, usually made of copper, brass, or stainless steel, is designed to possess approximately the inverse of the desired \ufb01nal shape of the part.An allowance in the tool size must be provided for the gap that exists between the tool and the work.To accomplish metal removal, the electrode is fed into the work at a rate equal to the rate of metal removal from the work. Metal removal rate is determined by Faraday\u2019s First Law, which states that the amount of chemical change produced by an electric current (i.e., the amount of metal dissolved) is proportional to the quantity of electricity passed (current  time): \rV  CIt (25.1) \r\rwhere V  volume of metal removed, mm3 (in3); C  a constant called the speci\ufb01c removal rate that depends on atomic weight, valence, and density of the work material, mm3/amp- s (in3/amp-min); I  current, amps; and t  time, s (min). \rBased on Ohm\u2019s law, current I \" E/R, where E \" voltage and R \" resistance. Under the conditions of the ECM operation, resistance is given by \rgr\rR \" (25.2)\rA \r\rwhere g \" gap between electrode and work, mm (in); r \" resistivity of electrolyte, ohm-mm (ohm-in); and A \" surface area between work and tool in the working frontal gap, mm2 (in2). Substituting this expression for R into Ohm\u2019s law, \rI \" EA \r(25.3)\rgr \r\rAnd substituting this equation back into the equation de\ufb01ning Faraday\u2019s law, C(EAt)\rV \" (25.4)\rgr \r\rIt is convenient to convert this equation into an expression for feed rate, the rate at which the electrode (tool) can be advanced into the work. This conversion can be accomplished in two steps. First, divide both sides of Equation (25.4) by At (area  time) to convert volume of metal removed into a linear travel rate: \r___ V \" CE\r\" fr (25.5)\rgrAt \r\rwhere fr  feed rate, mm/s (in/min). Second, substitute I/A in place of E/(gr), as provided by Equation (25.3).

Gap distance needs to be controlled closely. If g becomes too large, the electrochemical process slows down. However, if the electrode touches the work, a short circuit occurs, which stops the process altogether. As a practical matter, gap distance is usually maintained within a range 0.075 to 0.75 mm (0.003\u20130.030 in). \rWater is used as the base for the electrolyte in ECM. To reduce electrolyte resistivity, salts such as NaCl or NaNO3 are added in solution. In addition to carrying off the material that has been removed from the workpiece, the \ufb02owing electrolyte also serves the function of removing heat and hydrogen bubbles created in the chemical reactions of the process. The removed work material is in the form of microscopic particles that must be separated from the electrolyte through centrifuge, sedimentation, or other means. The separated particles form a thick sludge whose disposal is an environmental problem associated with ECM. \r\rLarge amounts of electrical power are required to perform ECM. As the equations indicate, rate of metal removal is determined by electrical power, speci\ufb01cally the current density that can be supplied to the operation.The voltage in ECM is kept relatively low to minimize arcing across the gap. \rElectrochemical machining is generally used in applications in which the work metal is very hard or dif\ufb01cult to machine, or the work part geometry is dif\ufb01cult (or impossible) to accomplish by conventional machining methods. Work hardness makes no difference in ECM, because the metal removal is not mechanical.

Disadvantages of ECM are (1) signi\ufb01cant cost of electrical power to drive the operation and (2) problems of disposing of the electrolyte sludge. \r\r25.2.2 ELECTROCHEMICAL DEBURRING AND GRINDING \rElectrochemical deburring (ECD) is an adaptation of ECM designed to remove burrs or to round sharp corners on metal work parts by anodic dissolution. One possible setup forECDisshown in Figure 25.5.The hole in the workparthas asharpburr of the type that is produced in a conventional through-hole drilling operation. The electrode tool is designed to focus the metal removal action on the burr. Portions of the tool not being used for machining are insulated.The electrolyte \ufb02ows through the hole to carry away the burr particles. The same ECM principles of operation also apply to ECD. However,since much less material is removed in electrochemical deburring,cycle times are much shorter. A typical cycle time in ECD is less than a minute. The time can be increased if it is desired to round the corner in addition to removing the burr. \rElectrochemical grinding (ECG) is a special form of ECM in which a rotating grinding wheel with a conductive bond material is used to augment the anodic dissolution of the metal work part surface, as illustrated in Figure 25.6. Abrasives used in ECG include aluminum oxide and diamond.The bond material is either metallic (for diamond abrasives) or resin bond impregnated with metal particles to make it electrically conductive (for aluminum oxide).The abrasive grits protruding from the grinding wheel at the contact with the work part establish the gap distance in ECG. The electrolyte \ufb02ows through the gap between the grains to play its role in electrolysis. \r\r\rDeplating is responsible for 95% or more of the metal removal in ECG, and the abrasive action of the grinding wheel removes the remaining 5% or less, mostly in the form of salt \ufb01lms that have been formed during the electrochemical reac tions at the work surface. Because most of the machining is accomplished by electro chemical action, the grinding wheel in ECG lasts much longer than a wheel in conventional grinding.The result is a much higher grinding ratio.In addition,dressing of the grinding wheel is required much less frequently. These are the signi\ufb01 cant advantages of the process. Applications of ECG include sharpening of cemented carbide tools and grinding of surgical needles, other thin wall tubes, and fragile parts. \r\r\r\r\rThermal Energy Processes \rMaterial removal processes based on thermal energy are characterized by very high local temperatures\u2014hot enough to remove material by fusion or vaporization.Because of the high temperatures, these processes cause physical and metallurgical damage to the new work surface.

The two main processes in this category are (1) electric discharge machining and (2) wire electric discharge machining.These processes can be used only on electrically conducting work materials. \r\r\r(a) \r\rElectric Discharge Machining Electric discharge machining (EDM) is one of the most widely used nontraditional processes. An EDM setup is illustrated in Figure 25.7. The shape of the \ufb01 nished work surface is produced by a formed electrode tool.The sparks occur across a small gap between tool and work surface.The EDM process must take place in the presence of a dielectric \ufb02uid, which creates a path for each discharge as the \ufb02uid becomes ionized in the gap. The discharges are generated by a pulsating direct current power supply connected to the work and the tool. \rFigure 25.7(b) shows a close-up view of the gap between the tool and the work. The discharge occurs at the location where the two surfaces are closest.The dielectric \ufb02 uid ionizes at this location to create a path for the discharge. The region in which discharge occurs is heated to extremely high temperatures, so that a small portion of the work surface is suddenly melted and removed.The \ufb02owing dielectric then \ufb02 ushes away the small particle (call it a \u201cchip\u201d). Because the surface of the work at the location of the previous discharge is now separated from the tool by a greater distance, this location is less likely to be the site of another spark until the surrounding regions have been reduced to the same level or below. Although the individual discharges remove metal at very localized points, they occur hundreds or thousands of times per second so that a gradual erosion of the entire surface occurs in the area of the gap. \rTwo important process parameters in EDM are discharge current and frequency of discharges. As either of these parameters is increased, metal removal rate increases. Surface roughness is also affected by current and frequency, as shown in Figure 25.8(a). The best surface \ufb01nish is obtained in EDM by operating at high frequencies and low discharge currents. As the electrode tool penetrates into the work, overcutting occurs. Overcut in EDM is the distance by which the machined cavity in the work part exceeds the size of the tool on each side of the tool,as illustrated in Figure 25.7(a).It is produced because the electrical discharges occur at the sides of the tool as well as its frontal area. Overcut is a function of current and frequency, as seen in Figure 25.8(b), and can amount to several hundredths of a millimeter. \r\rFIGURE 25.8 \r(a)\r Surface \ufb01nish in EDM as a function of \r\rdischarge current and frequency of discharges. \r\r(b) \rOvercut in EDM as a function of discharge current and frequency \r\r\rDischarge current Discharge current, frequency \rof discharges. \r(a) (b) \rThe high spark temperatures that melt the work also melt the tool, creating a small cavity in the surface opposite the cavity produced in the work. Tool wear is usually measured as the ratio of work material removed to tool material removed (similar to the grinding ratio). This wear ratio ranges between 1.0 and 100 or slightly above, depending on the combination of work and electrode materials. Electrodes are made of graphite, copper, brass, copper tungsten, silver tungsten, and other materials.

Tool wear is usually measured as the ratio of work material removed to tool material removed (similar to the grinding ratio). This wear ratio ranges between 1.0 and 100 or slightly above, depending on the combination of work and electrode materials. Electrodes are made of graphite, copper, brass, copper tungsten, silver tungsten, and other materials. The selection depends on the type of power supply circuit available on the EDM machine, the type of work material that is to be machined, and whether roughing or \ufb01 nishing is to be done. Graphite is preferred for many applications because of its melting characteristics. In fact, graphite does not melt. It vaporizes at very high temperatures, and the cavity created by the spark is generally smaller than for most other EDM electrode materials. Consequently, a high ratio of work material removed to tool wear is usually obtained with graphite tools. \rThe hardness and strength of the work material are not factors in EDM, because the process is not a contest of hardness between tool and work. The melting point of the work material is an important property, and metal removal rate can be related to melting point approximately by the following empirical formula, based on an equation described in Weller [18]: \rKI\rRMR \" 1.23 (25.7)\rTm where RMR  metal removal rate, mm3/s (in3/min); K \" constant of proportionality whose value  664 in SI units (5.08 in U.S. customary units); I  discharge current, amps; and Tm  melting temperature of work metal, C (F).

If discharge current  25 amps, what is the expected metal removal rate? \rSolution From Table 4.1, the melting point of copper is found to be 1083C.

Its other functions are to \ufb02ush debris out of the gap and remove heat from tool and work part. \rApplications of electric discharge machining include both tool fabrication and parts production.The tooling for many of the mechanical processes discussed in this book are often made by EDM, including molds for plastic injection molding, extrusion dies, wire drawing dies, forging and heading dies, and sheet metal stamping dies. As in ECM, the term die sinking is used for operations in which a mold cavity is produced, and the EDM process is sometimes referred to as ram EDM. For many of the applications, the materials used to fabricate the tooling are dif\ufb01cult (or impossible) to machine by conventional methods. Certain production parts also call for application of EDM. Examples include delicate parts that are not rigid enough to withstand conventional cutting forces, hole drilling where the axis of the hole is at an acute angle to the surface so that a conventional drill would be unable to start the hole, and production machining of hard and exotic metals. \rElectric Discharge Wire Cutting Electric discharge wire cutting (EDWC), commonly called wire EDM, is a special form of electric discharge machining that uses a small diameter wire as the electrode to cut a narrow kerf in the work. The cutting action in wire EDM is achieved by thermal energy from electric discharges between the electrode wire and the workpiece.Wire EDM is illustrated in Figure 25.9. The workpiece is fed past the wire to achieve the desired cutting path, somewhat in the manner of a bandsaw operation. Numerical control is used to control the work part motions during cutting.As it cuts,the wire is slowly and continuously advanced between a supply spool and a take-up spool to present a fresh electrode of constant diameter to the work.

The kerf is much narrower, corners can be made much sharper, and the cutting forces against the work are nil. In addition, hardness and toughness of the work material do not affect cutting performance.The only requirement is that the work material must be electrically conductive. \rThe special features of wire EDM make it ideal for making components for stamping dies. Because the kerf is so narrow, it is often possible to fabricate punch and die in a single cut, as suggested by Figure 25.11.

Besides machining, other applications of the technology include heat treating (Section 26.5.2) and welding (Section 29.4). Electron beam machining uses a high velocity stream of electrons focused on the workpiece surface to remove material by melting and vaporization. A schematic of the EBM process is illustrated in Figure 25.12. An electron beam gun generates a continuous stream of electrons that is accelerated to approximately 75% of the speed of light and focused through an electromagnetic lens on the work surface. The lens is capable of reducing the area of the beam to a diameter as small as 0.025 mm (0.001 in). On impinging the surface, the kinetic energy of the electrons is converted into thermal energy of extremely high density that melts or vaporizes the material in a very localized area. \rElectron beam machining is used for a variety of high-precision cutting applications on any known material. Applications include drilling of extremely small diameter holes\u2014down to 0.05 mm (0.002 in) diameter, drilling of holes with very high depth-to-diameter ratios\u2014more than 100:1, and cutting of slots that are only about 0.001 in (0.025 mm) wide. These cuts can be made to very close tolerances with no cutting forces or tool wear.

The term laser stands for light ampli\ufb01 cation by stimulated emission of radiation. A laser is an optical transducer that converts electrical energy into a highly coherent light beam.A laser light beam has several properties that distinguish it from other forms of light. It is monochromatic (theoretically, the light has a single wave length) and highly collimated (the light rays in the beam are almost perfectly parallel). These properties allow the light generated by a laser to be focused, using conventional optical lenses, onto a very small spot with resulting high power densities. Depending on the amount of energy contained in the light beam, and its degree of concentration at the spot, the various laser processes identi\ufb01ed above can be accomplished. \rLaser beam machining (LBM) uses the light energy from a laser to remove material by vaporization and ablation.The setup for LBM is illustrated in Figure 25.13.The types of lasers used in LBM are carbon dioxide gas lasers and solid-state lasers (of which there are several types).In laser beam machining,the energy of the coherent light beam is concentrated not only optically but also in terms of time.The light beam is pulsed so that the released energy results in an impulse against the work surface that produces a combination of evaporation and melting, with the melted material evacuating the surface at high velocity. \rLBM is used to perform various types of drilling, slitting, slotting, scribing, and marking operations. Drilling small diameter holes is possible\u2014down to 0.025 mm \r(0.001 in). For larger holes, above 0.50-mm (0.020-in) diameter, the laser beam is controlled to cut the outline of the hole. LBM is not considered a mass production process, and it is generally used on thin stock. The range of work materials that can be machined by LBM is virtually unlimited. Ideal properties of a material for LBM \r\r\r\r(0.8 in) long. (Courtesyof George E. KaneManufacturingTechnology Laboratory, Lehigh University.) \rinclude high light energy absorption, poor re\ufb02ectivity, good thermal conductivity, low speci\ufb01c heat, low heat of fusion, and low heat of vaporization. Of course, no material has this ideal combination of properties.

Most arc-cutting processes use the heat generated by an arc between an electrode and a metallic work part (usually a \ufb02at plate or sheet) to melt a kerf that separates the part. The most common arc-cutting processes are \r(1) plasma arc cutting and (2) air carbon arc cutting [11]. \rPlasma Arc Cutting A plasma is a superheated, electrically ionized gas. Plasma arc cutting (PAC) uses a plasma stream operating at temperatures in the range 10,000\u00b0C to 14,000\u00b0C (18,000\u00b0F\u201325,000\u00b0F) to cut metal by melting, as shown in Figure 25.15. The cutting action operates by directing the high-velocity plasma stream at the work, thus melting it and blowing the molten metal through the kerf. The plasma arc is generated between an electrode inside the torch and the anode workpiece. The plasma \ufb02ows through a water-cooled nozzle that constricts and directs the stream to the desired location on the work. The resulting plasma jet is a high-velocity, well-collimated stream with extremely high temperatures at its center, hot enough to cut through metal in some cases 150 mm (6 in) thick. \r\rGases used to create the plasma in PAC include nitrogen, argon, hydrogen, or mixtures of these gases. These are referred to as the primary gases in the process. Secondary gases or water are often directed to surround the plasma jet to help con\ufb01ne the arc and clean the kerf of molten metal as it forms. \rMost applications of PAC involve cutting of \ufb02at metal sheets and plates. Operations include hole piercing and cutting along a de\ufb01ned path. The desired path can be cut either by use of a hand-held torch manipulated by a human operator, or by directing the cutting path of the torch under numerical control (NC). For faster production and higher accuracy, NC is preferred because of better control over the important process variables such as standoff distance and feed rate. Plasma arc cutting can be used to cut nearly any electrically conductive metal. Metals frequently cut by PAC include plain carbon steel,stainless steel,and aluminum.The advantage of NC in these applications is high productivity. Feed rates along the cutting path can be as high as 200 mm/s (450 in/min) for 6-mm (0.25-in) aluminum plate and 85 mm/s (200 in/min) for 6-mm (0.25-in) steel plate [8]. Feed rates must be reduced for thicker stock. For example, the maximum feed rate for cutting 100-mm-(4-in)-thick aluminum stock is around 8 mm/s (20 in/min) [8]. Disadvantages of PAC are (1) the cut surface is rough, and (2) metallurgical damage at the surface is the most severe among the nontraditional metalworking processes. \rAir Carbon Arc Cutting In this process, the arc is generated between a carbon electrode and the metallic work, and a high-velocity air jet is used to blow away the melted portion of the metal. This procedure can be used to form a kerf for severing the piece, or to gouge a cavity in the part.

The purpose of the oxyfuel combustion is to raise the temperature in the region of cutting to support the reaction. These processes are commonly used to cut ferrous metal plates, in which \rthe rapid oxidation of iron occurs according to the following reactions [11]: \r Fe  O \u2192 FeO  heat  (25.8a)  \r3Fe  2O2 \u2192 Fe3O4  heat  (25.8b)  \r2Fe  1.5O2 \u2192 Fe2O3  heat  (25.8c)  \r\rThe second of these reactions, Equation (25.8b), is the most signi\ufb01cant in terms of heat generation. \rThe cutting mechanism for nonferrous metals is somewhat different.These metals are generally characterized by lower melting temperatures than the ferrous metals, and they are more oxidation resistant. In these cases, the heat of combustion of the oxyfuel mixture plays a more important role in creating the kerf. Also, to promote the metal oxidation reaction, chemical \ufb02uxes or metallic powders are often added to the oxygen stream. \rFuels used in OFC include acetylene (C2H2), MAPP (methylacetylene-propadiene\u2014 C3H4),propylene (C3H6),and propane (C3H8).Flame temperatures and heats of combustion for these fuels are listed in Table 29.2. Acetylene burns at the highest \ufb02 ame temperature and is the most widely used fuel for welding and cutting. However, there are certain hazards with the storage and handling of acetylene that must be considered (Section 29.3.1). \rOFC processes are performed either manually or by machine. Manually operated torches are used for repair work, cutting of scrap metal, trimming of risers from sand castings, and similar operations that generally require minimal accuracy. For production work, machine \ufb02ame cutting allows faster speeds and greater accuracies. This equipment is often numerically controlled to allow pro\ufb01led shapes to be cut. \r\r\rChemical Machining \rChemical machining (CHM) is a nontraditional process in which material is removed by means of a strong chemical etchant.Applications as an industrial process began shortly after World War II in the aircraft industry.

Differences in applications and the ways in which the steps are implemented account for the different forms of CHM. The steps are: \r1. \rCleaning. The \ufb01rst step is a cleaning operation to ensure that material will be removed uniformly from the surfaces to be etched. \r\r2. \rMasking.A protective coating called a maskant is applied to certain portions of the part surface. This maskant is made of a material that is chemically resistant to the etchant (the term resist is used for this masking material). It is therefore applied to those portions of the work surface that are not to be etched. \r\r3. \rEtching. This is the material removal step. The part is immersed in an etchant that chemically attacks those portions of the part surface that are not masked. The usual method of attack is to convert the work material (e.g., a metal) into a salt that dissolves in the etchant and is thereby removed from the surface.When the desired amount of material has been removed, the part is withdrawn from the etchant and washed to stop the process. \r\r4. \rDemasking. The maskant is removed from the part. \r\r\rThe two steps in chemical machining that involve signi\ufb01cant variations in methods, materials, and process parameters are masking and etching\u2014steps 2 and 3. \rMaskant materials include neoprene, polyvinylchloride, polyethylene, and other polymers. Masking can be accomplished by any of three methods: (1) cut and peel, \r(2) photographic resist, and (3) screen resist. The cut and peel method applies the maskant over the entire part by dipping, painting, or spraying. The resulting thickness of the maskant is 0.025 to 0.125 mm (0.001\u20130.005 in). After the maskant has hardened, it is cut using a scribing knife and peeled away in the areas of the work surface that are to be etched. The maskant cutting operation is performed by hand, usually guiding the knife with a template.The cut and peel method is generally used for large work parts, low production quantities, and where accuracy is not a critical factor. This method cannot hold tolerances tighter than 0.125 mm (0.005 in) except with extreme care. \rAs the name suggests, the photographic resist method (called the photoresist method for short) uses photographic techniques to perform the masking step. The masking materials contain photosensitive chemicals.They are applied to the work surface and exposed to light through a negative image of the desired areas to be etched. These areas of the maskant can then be removed from the surface using photographic developing techniques. This procedure leaves the desired surfaces of the part protected by the maskant and the remaining areas unprotected, vulnerable to chemical etching. Photoresist masking techniques are normally applied where small parts are produced in high quantities,and close tolerances are required.Tolerances closer than 0.0125 mm (0.0005 in) can be held [18]. \rThe screen resist method applies the maskant by means of silk screening methods. In these methods, the maskant is painted onto the work part surface through a silk \r\rTABLE \u2022 25.2 Common work materials and etchants in CHM, with typicalpenetration rates and etch factors. \r\rCompiled from [5], [8], and [18].

The etchant must also be matched with the type of maskant that is used to ensure that the maskant material is not chemically attacked by the etchant. Table 25.2 lists some of the work materials machined by CHM together with the etchants that are generally used on these materials. Also included in the table are penetration rates and etch factors. These parameters are explained next. \rMaterial removal rates in CHM are generally indicated as penetration rates, mm/min (in/min), because rate of chemical attack of the work material by the etchant is directed into the surface. The penetration rate is unaffected by surface area. Penetration rates listed in Table 25.2 are typical values for the given material and etchant. \rDepths of cut in chemical machining are as much as 12.5 mm (0.5 in) for aircraft panels made out of metal plates. However, many applications require depths that are only several hundredths of a millimeter. Along with the penetration into the work, etching also occurs sideways under the maskant, as illustrated in Figure 25.16. The \r\r\rFIGURE 25.16 \rUndercut in chemical machining. \reffect is referred to as the undercut, and it must be accounted for in the design of the mask for the resulting cut to have the speci\ufb01ed dimensions. For a given work material, the undercut is directly related to the depth of cut.The constant of proportionality for the material is called the etch factor, de\ufb01 ned as \r\" d (25.9)\rFe u \rwhere Fe  etch factor; d  depth of cut, mm (in); and u  undercut, mm (in). The dimensions u and d are de\ufb01ned in Figure 25.16. Different work materials have different etch factors in chemical machining. Some typical values are presented in Table 25.2.The etch factor can be used to determine the dimensions of the cutaway areas in the maskant, so that the speci\ufb01ed dimensions of the etched areas on the part can be achieved. \r\r\r25.4.2 CHM PROCESSES \rThis section describes the principle chemical machining processes: (1) chemical milling, \r(2) chemical blanking, (3) chemical engraving, and (4) photochemical machining. \rChemical Milling Chemical milling was the \ufb01rst CHM process to be commercialized. During World War II, an aircraft company in the United States began to use chemical milling toremovemetalfromaircraftcomponents.They referredto their process asthe \u201cchem-mill\u201dprocess.Today,chemical milling is still used largely in the aircraft industry, to remove material from aircraft wing and fuselage panels for weight reduction. It is applicable to large parts where substantial amounts of metal are removed during the process. The cut and peel maskant method is employed. A template is generally used that takes into account the undercut that will result during etching. The sequence of processing steps is illustrated in Figure 25.17. \rChemical milling produces a surface \ufb01 nish that varies with different work materials.

In both instances, conventional punch-and-die methods do not work because the stamping forces damage the sheet metal, or the tooling cost would be prohibitive, or both. Chemical blanking produces parts that are burr free, an advantage over conventional shearing operations. \rMethods used for applying the maskant in chemical blanking are either the photo resist method or the screen resist method. For small and/or intricate cutting patterns and close tolerances, the photoresist method is used. Tolerances as close as 0.0025 mm (0.0001 in) can be held on 0.025-mm (0.001-in)-thick stock using the photoresist method of masking. As stock thickness increases, more generous tolerances must be allowed. Screen resist masking methods are not nearly so accurate as photoresist. The small work size in chemical blanking excludes the cut and peel maskant method. \rUsing the screen resist method to illustrate, the steps in chemical blanking are shown in Figure 25.18. Because chemical etching takes place on both sides of the part in chemical blanking, it is important that the masking procedure provides accurate registration between the two sides. Otherwise, the erosion into the part from opposite directions will not line up. This is especially critical with small part sizes and intricate patterns. \rApplication of chemical blanking is generally limited to thin materials and/or intricate patterns for reasons given above. Maximum stock thickness is around \rFIGURE 25.18 \rSequence of processing steps in chemical blanking: (1) clean raw part, (2) apply resist (maskant) by painting through screen, (3) etch (partially completed), \r(4) etch (completed), and (5) remove resist and clean to yield \ufb01 nished part. \r\r0.75 mm (0.030 in). Also, hardened and brittle materials can be processed by chemical blanking where mechanical methods would surely fracture the work. \rChemical Engraving Chemical engraving is a chemical machining process for making name plates and other \ufb02at panels that have lettering and/or artwork on one side. These plates and panels would otherwise be made using a conventional engraving machine or similar process. Chemical engraving can be used to make panels with either recessed lettering or raised lettering, simply by reversing the portions of the panel to be etched. Masking is done by either the photoresist or screen resist methods. The sequence in chemical engraving is similar to the other CHM processes, except that a \ufb01lling operation follows etching. The purpose of \ufb01 lling is to apply paint or other coating into the recessed areas that have been created by etching. Then, the panel is immersed in a solution that dissolves the resist but does not attack the coating material. Thus, when the resist is removed, the coating remains in the etched areas but not in the areas that were masked. The effect is to highlight the pattern. \rPhotochemical Machining Photochemical machining (PCM) is chemical machining in which the photoresist method of masking is used.

Then, the panel is immersed in a solution that dissolves the resist but does not attack the coating material. Thus, when the resist is removed, the coating remains in the etched areas but not in the areas that were masked. The effect is to highlight the pattern. \rPhotochemical Machining Photochemical machining (PCM) is chemical machining in which the photoresist method of masking is used. The term can therefore be applied correctly to chemical blanking and chemical engraving when these methods use the photographic resist method. PCM is employed in metalworking when close tolerances and/or intricate patterns are required on \ufb02at parts.

There are various ways to photographically expose the desired image onto the resist. The \ufb01gure shows the negative in contact with the surface of the resist during exposure.This is contact printing,but other photo graphic printing methods are available that expose the negative through a lens system to enlarge or reduce the size of the pattern printed on the resist surface. Photoresist materials in current use are sensitive to ultraviolet light but not to light of other wavelengths. Therefore, with proper lighting in the factory, there is no need to carry out the processing steps in a dark room environment. Once the masking operation is accomplished, the remaining steps in the procedure are similar to the other chemical machining methods. \rIn photochemical machining, the term corresponding to etch factor is anisotropy, \rwhich is de\ufb01ned as the depth of cut d divided by the undercut u (see Figure 25.16). \rThis is the same de\ufb01nition as in Equation (25.9). \r\r\r\rApplication Considerations \rTypical applications of nontraditional processes include special geometric features and work materials that cannot be readily processed by conventional techniques.

However, certain processes are not suited to certain work materials. Table 25.5 relates applicability of the nontraditional processes to various types of materials.

The capabilities for dimensional control and surface \ufb01nish of the nontraditional processes vary widely, with some of the processes providing high accuracies and good \ufb01nishes, and others yielding poor accuracies and \ufb01nishes. Surface damage is also a consideration. Some of these processes produce very little metallurgical damage at and immediately below the work surface, whereas others (mostly the thermal-based processes) do considerable damage to the surface. Table 25.6 compares these features of the prominent nontraditional methods, using conventional milling and surface grinding for comparison. Inspection of the data reveals wide differences in machining characteristics. In comparing the characteristics of nontraditional and conventional machining, it must be remembered that nontraditional processes are generally used where conventional methods are not practical or economical. \r\r[1] Aronson,R.B.\u201cWaterjets Move into the Mainstream,\u201d Manufacturing Engineering, April 2005, pp. 69\u201374.\r [2] Bellows, G., and Kohls, J.

This part of the book considers processes that either enhance the properties of a work part (Chapter 26) or apply some surface treatment to it, such as cleaning or coating (Chapter 27). Property-enhancing operations are performed to improve mechanical or physical properties of the work material. They do not alter part geometry, at least not intentionally. The most important property-enhancing operations are heat treatments. Heat treatment involves various heating and cooling procedures performed to effect microstructural changes in a material,which in turn affect its mechanical properties. Its most common applications are on metals, discussed in this chapter. Similar treatments are performed on glass-ceramics (Section 7.4.3), tempered glass (Section 12.3.1), and powder metals and ceramics (Sections 15.3.3 and 16.2.3). \rHeat treatment operations can be performed on a metallic work part at various times during its manufacturing sequence. In some cases, the treatment is applied before shaping (e.g., to soften the metal so that it can be more easily formed while hot). In other cases, heat treatment is used to relieve the effects of strain hardening that occur during forming, so that the material can be subjected to further deformation. Heat treatment can also be accomplished at or near the end of the sequence to achieve the \ufb01nal strength and hardness required in the \ufb01nished product.The principal heat treatments are annealing,martensite formation in steel, precipitation hardening, and surface hardening. \r\r\r\r\r\rAnnealing \rAnnealing consists of heating the metal to a suitable temperature, holding at that temperature for a certain time (called soaking), and slowly cooling. It is performed on a metal for any of the following reasons: (1) to reduce hardness and brittleness, (2) to alter microstructure so that desirable mechanical properties can be obtained, (3) to soften metals for improved machinability or formability, (4) to recrystallize cold-worked (strain-hardened) metals, and (5) to relieve residual stresses induced by prior processes. Different terms are used in annealing, depending on the details of the process and the temperature used relative to the recrystallization temperature of the metal being treated. \rFull annealing is associated with ferrous metals (usually low and medium carbon steels); it involves heating the alloy into the austenite region, followed by slow cooling in the furnace to produce coarse pearlite. Normalizing involves similar heating and soaking cycles, but the cooling rates are faster. The steel is allowed to cool in air to room temperature. This results in \ufb01ne pearlite, higher strength and hardness, but lower ductility than the full anneal treatment. \rCold-worked parts are often annealed to reduce effects of strain hardening and increase ductility. The treatment allows the strain-hardened metal to recrystallize partially or completely, depending on temperatures, soaking periods, and cooling rates. When annealing is performed to allow for further cold working of the part, it is called a process anneal.When performed on the completed (cold-worked) part to remove the effects of strain hardening and where no subsequent deformation will be accomplished, it is simply called an anneal. The process itself is pretty much the same, but different terms are used to indicate the purpose of the treatment. \rIf annealing conditions permit full recovery of the cold-worked metal to its original grain structure, then recrystallization has occurred.After this type of anneal,the metal has the new geometry created by the forming operation, but its grain structure and associated properties are essentially the same as before cold working. The conditions that tend to favor recrystallization are higher temperature, longer holding time, and slower cooling rate. If the annealing process only permits partial return of the grain structure toward its original state, it is termed a recovery anneal.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4509, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de521f64-3b0b-46c2-9780-c42e9905f5e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "de521f64-3b0b-46c2-9780-c42e9905f5e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec26.txt", "file_name": "sec26.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 30455, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "81187b6c-2fd6-4916-8f44-2282740d56de", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec26.txt", "file_name": "sec26.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 30455, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "cc542e6d7ac022f2ec4154182d16fa3c49b2c9218858d6c86a69fb101a4af8f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ea081f2-3886-4b4d-9937-ef61848b6ab5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec26.txt", "file_name": "sec26.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 30455, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "2623fa251c07056ba1ff0c32d79514f46778f8b152fbfc6e080de8483debd734", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2e6259dc-3acd-4872-a65c-813224316482", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3fba6f507cea282de212d864f6454e88070c74b774765bba47a0643095510939", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "When annealing is performed to allow for further cold working of the part, it is called a process anneal.When performed on the completed (cold-worked) part to remove the effects of strain hardening and where no subsequent deformation will be accomplished, it is simply called an anneal.

Recovery allows the metal to retain most of the strain hardening obtained in cold working, but the toughness of the part is improved. \rThe preceding annealing operations are performed primarily to accomplish functions other than stress relief. However, annealing is sometimes performed solely to relieve residual stresses in the workpiece. Called stress-relief annealing,it helps to reduce distortion and dimensional variations that might otherwise occur in the stressed parts. \r\rMartensite Formation in Steel \rThe iron\u2013carbon phase diagram in Figure 6.4 indicates the phases of iron and iron carbide (cementite) present under equilibrium conditions. It assumes that cooling from high temperature is slow enough to permit austenite to decompose into a mixture of ferrite and cementite (Fe3C) at room temperature. This decomposition reaction requires diffusion and other processes that depend on time and temperature to transform the metal into its preferred \ufb01 nal form. However, under conditions of rapid cooling, so that the equilibrium reaction is inhibited, austenite transforms into a nonequilibrium phase called martensite. Martensite is a hard, brittle phase that gives steel its unique ability to be strengthened to very high levels. \r26.2.1 THE TIME-TEMPERATURE-TRANSFORMATION CURVE \rThe nature of the martensite transformation can best be understood using the timetemperature-transformation curve (TTT curve) for eutectoid steel, illustrated in Figure 26.1. The TTT curve shows how cooling rate affects the transformation of austenite into various possible phases.The phases can be divided between (1) alternative forms of ferrite and cementite and (2) martensite. Time is displayed (logarithmically for convenience) along the horizontal axis, and temperature is scaled on the vertical axis. The curve is interpreted by starting at time zero in the austenite region (somewhere above the A1 temperature line for the given composition) and proceeding downward and to the right along a trajectory representing how the metal is cooled as a function of time. The TTT curve shown in the \ufb01 gure is for a speci\ufb01 c composition of steel (0.80% carbon). The shape of the curve is different for other compositions. \rAt slow cooling rates, the trajectory proceeds through the region indicating transformation into pearlite or bainite, which are alternative forms of ferrite\u2013carbide mixtures. Because these transformations take time, the TTT diagram shows two lines\u2014the start and \ufb01nish of the transformation as time passes, indicated for the different phase regions by the subscripts s and f, respectively. Pearlite is a mixture of ferrite and carbide phases in the form of thin parallel plates. It is obtained by slow cooling from austenite, so that the cooling trajectory passes through Ps above the \u201cnose\u201d of the TTT curve.

Bainite has a needle-like or feather-like structure consisting of \ufb01ne carbide regions. \rIf cooling occurs at a suf\ufb01ciently rapid rate (indicated by the dashed line in Figure 26.1), austenite is transformed into martensite. Martensite is a unique phase consisting of an iron\u2013carbon solution whose composition is the same as the austenite from which it was derived. The face-centered cubic structure of austenite is transformed into the body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure of martensite almost instantly\u2014without the time-dependent diffusion process needed to separate ferrite and iron carbide in the preceding transformations. \rDuring cooling, the martensite transformation begins at a certain temperature Ms, and \ufb01nishes at a lower temperature Mf, as shown in the TTT diagram. At points between these two levels, the steel is a mixture of austenite and martensite. If cooling is stopped at a temperature between the Ms and Mf lines, the austenite will transform to bainite as the time-temperature trajectory crosses the Bs threshold. The level of the Ms line is in\ufb02uenced by alloying elements, including carbon. In some cases, the Ms line is depressed below room temperature, making it impossible for these steels to form martensite by traditional heat-treating methods. \rThe extreme hardness of martensite results from the lattice strain created by carbon atoms trapped in the BCT structure, thus providing a barrier to slip. Figure 26.2 shows the signi\ufb01cant effect that the martensite transformation has on the hardness of steel for increasing carbon contents. \r\r26.2.2 THE HEAT TREATMENT PROCESS \rHardness, Rockwell C (HRC)\r\rThe heat treatment to form martensite consists of two steps: austenitizing and quenching. These steps are often followed by tempering to produce tempered martensite. Austenitizing involves heating the steel to a suf\ufb01 ciently high temperature that it is converted entirely or partially to austenite. This temperature can be determined from the phase diagram for the particular alloy composition. The transformation to austenite involves a phase change, which requires time as well as heat. Accordingly, the steel must be held at the elevated temperature for a suf\ufb01 cient period of time to allow the new phase to form and the required homogeneity of composition to be achieved. \rThe quenching step involves cooling the austenite rapidly enough to avoid passing through the nose of the TTT curve, as indicated in the cooling trajectory shown in Figure 26.1. The cooling rate depends on the quenching medium and the rate of heat transfer within the steel workpiece. Various quenching media are used in commercial heat treatment practice: (1) brine\u2014salt water, usually agitated; (2) fresh water\u2014still, not agitated; (3) still oil; and (4) air. Quenching in agitated brine provides the fastest cooling of the heated part surface, whereas air quench is the slowest. Trouble is, the more effective the quenching media is at cooling, the more likely it is to cause internal stresses, distortion, and cracks in the product. \rThe rate of heat transfer within the part depends largely on its mass and geometry.

A large cubic shape will cool much more slowly than a small, thin sheet. The coef\ufb01 cient of thermal conductivity k of the particular composition is also a factor in the \ufb02ow of heat in the metal. There is considerable variation in k for different grades of steel; for example, plain low carbon steel has a typical k value equal to 0.046 J/sec-mm-C (2.2 Btu/hr-in-F), whereas a highly alloyed steel might have one-third that value. \rMartensite is hard and brittle. Tempering is a heat treatment applied to hardened steels to reduce brittleness, increase ductility and toughness, and relieve stresses in the martensite structure. It involves heating and soaking at a temperature below the austenitizing level for about one hour, followed by slow cooling. This results in precipitation of very \ufb01ne carbide particles from the martensitic iron\u2013carbon solution, and gradually transforms the crystal structure from BCT to BCC. This new structure is called tempered martensite. A slight reduction in strength and hardness accompanies the improvement in ductility and toughness. The temperature and time of the tempering treatment control the degree of softening in the hardened steel, because the change from untempered to tempered martensite involves diffusion. \rTaken together, the three steps in the heat treatment of steel to form tempered martensite can be pictured as in Figure 26.3. There are two heating and cooling cycles, the \ufb01rst to produce martensite and the second to temper the martensite. \r400 \r\r500 \r200 \r1500800 600\rTemperature, \u00b0C \rTemperature, \u00b0F \r1000 \rFIGURE 26.3 Typical heat treatment of steel: austenitizing, quenching, and tempering. \r\r\rTest specimen \r60 length \r25.4-mm \r102-mm \r50 diameter \r\rFIGURE 26.4 The \r40\rJominy end-quench \rWater \rtest: (a) setup of the test, \r24\u00b0C (75\u00b0F)\rshowing end quench of \r30\rthe test specimen; and \r(b) typical pattern of \r\rDistance from\rhardness readings as \rquenched end\ra function of distance \r(a) (b)\rfrom quenched end. \r\r26.2.3 HARDENABILITY \rHardness, Rockwell C \r\rHardenability refers to the relative capacity of a steel to be hardened by transformation to martensite. It is a property that determines the depth below the quenched surface to which the steel is hardened, or the severity of the quench required to achieve a certain hardness penetration. Steels with good hardenability can be hardened more deeply below the surface and do not require high cooling rates. Harden-ability does not refer to the maximum hardness that can be attained in the steel; that depends on the carbon content. \rThe hardenability of a steel is increased through alloying. Alloying elements having the greatest effect are chromium, manganese, molybdenum (and nickel, to a lesser extent). The mechanism by which these alloying ingredients operate is to extend the time before the start of the austenite-to-pearlite transformation in the TTT diagram. In effect, the TTT curve is moved to the right, thus permitting slower quenching rates during quenching.Therefore,the cooling trajectory is able to follow a less hastened path to the Ms line, more easily avoiding the nose of the TTT curve. \rThe most common method for measuring hardenability is the Jominy end-quench test.

The test involves heating a standard specimen of diameter ! 25.4 mm (1.0 in) and length ! 102 mm (4.0 in) into the austenite range, and then quenching one end with a stream of cold water while the specimen is supported vertically as shown in Figure 26.4(a). The cooling rate in the test specimen decreases with increased distance from the quenched end. Hardenability is indicated by the hardness of the specimen as a function of distance from quenched end, as in Figure 26.4(b). \r\r\rPrecipitation Hardening \rPrecipitation hardening involves the formation of \ufb01 ne particles (precipitates) that act to block the movement of dislocations and thus strengthen and harden the metal. It is the principal heat treatment for strengthening alloys of aluminum, copper, magnesium, nickel, and other nonferrous metals. Precipitation hardening can also be used to strengthen certain steel alloys.When applied to steels,the process is called maraging (an abbreviation of martensite and aging), and the steels are called maraging steels (Section 6.2.3). \rFIGURE 26.5 \rPrecipitation hardening: \r(a) phase diagram of analloy system consistingof metals A and B that can be precipitationhardened; and (b) heattreatment: (1) solutiontreatment, (2) quenching, and (3) precipitation treatment. \r\rThe necessary condition that determines whether an alloy system can be strengthened by precipitation hardening is the presence of a sloping solvus line, as shown in the phase diagram of Figure 26.5(a). A composition that can be precipitation hardened is one that contains two phases at room temperature, but which can be heated to a temperature that dissolves the second phase. Composition C satis\ufb01 es this require-ment.The heat treatment process consists of three steps,illustrated in Figure 26.5(b): \r(1) solution treatment, in which the alloy is heated to a temperature Ts above the solvus line into the alpha phase region and held for a period suf\ufb01 cient to dissolve the beta phase; (2) quenching to room temperature to create a supersaturated solid solution; and (3) precipitation treatment, in which the alloy is heated to a temperature Tp, below Ts, to cause precipitation of \ufb01 ne particles of the beta phase. This third step is called aging, and for this reason the whole heat treatment is sometimes called age hardening. However, aging can occur in some alloys at room temperature, and so the term precipitation hardening seems more precise for the three-step heat treatment process under discussion here. When the aging step is performed at room temperature, it is called natural aging. When it is accomplished at an elevated temperature, as in the \ufb01gure, the term arti\ufb01 cial aging is often used. \rIt is during the aging step that high strength and hardness are achieved in the alloy. The combination of temperature and time during the precipitation treatment (aging) is critical in bringing out the desired properties in the alloy.At higher precipitation treatment temperatures, as in Figure 26.6(a), the hardness peaks in a relatively short time; whereas at lower temperatures, as in (b), more time is required to harden the alloy but its maximum hardness is likely to be greater than \rFIGURE 26.6 Effect of temperature and timeduring precipitationtreatment (aging):\r(a)\r high precipitationtemperature; and\r\r(b)\r lower precipitation temperature. \r\r\r\rin the \ufb01rst case.

As seen in the plot, continuation of the aging process results in a reduction in hardness and strength properties, called overaging. Its overall effect is similar to annealing. \r\r\rSurface Hardening \rSurface hardening refers to any of several thermochemical treatments applied to steels in which the composition of the part surface is altered by addition of carbon, nitrogen,or other elements.The most common treatments are carburizing,nitriding, and carbonitriding. These processes are commonly applied to low carbon steel parts to achieve a hard, wear-resistant outer shell while retaining a tough inner core. The term case hardening is often used for these treatments. \rCarburizing is the most common surface-hardening treatment. It involves heating a part of low carbon steel in the presence of a carbon-rich environment so that C is diffused into the surface. In effect the surface is converted to a high carbon steel, capable of higher hardness than the low-C core.The carbon-rich environment can be created in several ways. One method involves the use of carbonaceous materials such as charcoal or coke packed in a closed container with the parts. This process, called pack carburizing, produces a relatively thick layer on the part surface, ranging from around 0.6 to 4 mm (0.025\u20130.150 in). Another method, called gas carburizing, uses hydrocarbon fuels such as propane (C3H8) inside a sealed furnace to diffuse carbon into the parts. The case thickness in this treatment is thin, 0.13 to 0.75 mm (0.005 to \r0.030 in). Another process is liquid carburizing, which employs a molten salt bath containing sodium cyanide (NaCN), barium chloride (BaCl2), and other compounds to diffuse carbon into the steel. This process produces surface layer thicknesses generally between those of the other two treatments. Typical carburizing temperatures are 875\u00b0 to 925\u00b0C (1600\u00b0\u20131700\u00b0F), well into the austenite range. \rCarburizing followed by quenching produces a case hardness of around HRC ! 60. However, because the internal regions of the part consist of low carbon steel, and its hardenability is low, it is unaffected by the quench and remains relatively tough and ductile to withstand impact and fatigue stresses. \rNitriding is a treatment in which nitrogen is diffused into the surfaces of special alloy steels to produce a thin hard casing without quenching. To be most effective, the steel must contain certain alloying ingredients such as aluminum (0.85\u20131.5%) or chromium (5% or more). These elements form nitride compounds that precipitate as very \ufb01ne particles in the casing to harden the steel. Nitriding methods include: gas nitriding, in which the steel parts are heated in an atmosphere of ammonia (NH3) or other nitrogen-rich gas mixture; and liquid nitriding, in which the parts are dipped in molten cyanide salt baths.

Chromizing requires higher temperatures and longer treatment times than the preceding surface-hardening treatments, but the resulting casing is not only hard and wear resistant, it is also heat and corrosion resistant. The process is usually applied to low carbon steels. Techniques for diffusing chromium into the surface include: packing the steel parts in chromium-rich powders or granules, dipping in a molten salt bath containing Cr and Cr salts, and chemical vapor deposition (Section 27.5.2). \rBoronizing is performed on tool steels, nickel- and cobalt-based alloys, and cast irons, in addition to plain carbon steels, using powders, salts, or gas atmospheres containing boron. The process results in a thin casing with high abrasion resistance and low coef\ufb01cient of friction.Casing hardnesses reach 70 HRC.When boronizing is used on low carbon and low alloy steels, corrosion resistance is also improved. \r\r\rHeat Treatment Methods and Facilities \rMost heat treatment operations are performed in furnaces. In addition, other techniques can be used to selectively heat only the work surface or a portion of the work surface. It should be mentioned that some of the equipment described in this section is utilized for other processes in addition to heat treatment; these include melting metals for casting (Section 11.4.1); heating before warm and hot working (Section 17.3); brazing, soldering, and adhesive curing (Chapter 30); and semiconductor processing (Chapter 33). \r26.5.1 FURNACES FOR HEAT TREATMENT \rFurnaces vary greatly in heating technology, size and capacity, construction, and atmosphere control. They usually heat the work parts by a combination of radiation, convection, and conduction. Heating technologies divide between fuel-\ufb01red and electric heating. Fuel-\ufb01 red furnaces are normally direct-\ufb01 red, which means that the work is exposed directly to the combustion products. Fuels include gases (such as natural gas or propane) and oils that can be atomized (such as diesel fuel and fuel oil). The chemistry of the combustion products can be controlled by adjusting the fuel-air or fuel-oxygen mixture to minimize scaling (oxide formation) on the work surface. Electric furnaces use electric resistance for heating; they are cleaner, quieter, and provide more uniform heating, but they are more expensive to purchase and operate. \rA conventional furnace is an enclosure designed to resist heat loss and accommodate the size of the work to be processed. Furnaces are classi\ufb01 ed as batch or continuous. Batch furnaces are simpler, basically consisting of a heating system in an insulated chamber, with a door for loading and unloading the work. Continuous furnaces are generally used for higher production rates and provide a means of moving the work through the interior of the heating chamber. \rSpecial atmospheres are required in certain heat treatment operations, such as some of the surface hardening treatments. These atmospheres include carbon-and nitrogen-rich environments for diffusion of these elements into the surface of the work.Atmosphere control is also desirable in conventional heat treatment operations to avoid excessive oxidation or decarburization. \rOther furnace types include salt bath and \ufb02 uidized bed. Salt bath furnaces consist of vessels containing molten salts of chlorides and/or nitrates. Parts to be treated are immersed in the molten media.

They differ from surface-hardening methods (Section 26.4) in that no chemical changes occur. Here the treatments are only thermal. The selective surface hardening methods include \ufb02ame hardening, induction hardening, high-frequency resistance heating, electron beam heating, and laser beam heating. \rFlame hardening involves heating the work surface by means of one or more torches followed by rapid quenching. As a hardening process, it is applied to carbon and alloy steels, tool steels, and cast irons. Fuels include acetylene (C2H2), propane (C3H8), and other gases. The name \ufb02ame hardening invokes images of a highly manual operation with general lack of control over the results; however, the process can be set up to include temperature control, \ufb01xtures for positioning the work relative to the \ufb02ame, and indexing devices that operate on a precise cycle time, all of which provide close control over the resulting heat treatment. It is fast and versatile, lending itself to high production as well as big components such as large gears that exceed the capacity of furnaces. \rInduction heating involves application of electromagnetically induced energy supplied by an induction coil to an electrically conductive work part. Induction heating is widely used in industry for processes such as brazing, soldering, adhesive curing, and various heat treatments. When used for hardening steel, quenching follows heating. A typical setup is illustrated in Figure 26.7. The induction heating coil carries a high-frequency alternating current that induces a current in the encircled work part to effect heating. The surface, a portion of the surface, or the entire mass of the part can be heated by the process. Induction heating provides a fast and ef\ufb01 cient method of heating any electrically conductive material. Heating cycle times are short, so the process lends itself to high production as well as midrange production. \r\rHigh-frequency (HF) resistance heating is used to harden speci\ufb01c areas of steel work surfaces by application of localized resistance heating at high frequency (400 kHz typical). A typical setup is shown in Figure 26.8. The apparatus consists of a water-cooled proximity conductor located over the area to be heated. Contacts are attached to the work part at the outer edges of the area. When the HF current is applied, the region beneath the proximity conductor is heated rapidly to high temperature\u2014heating to the austenite range typically requires less than \r\rFIGURE 26.7 Typical induction heatingsetup.

When the power is turned off, the area, usually a narrow line as in the \ufb01 gure, is quenched by heat transfer to the surrounding metal. Depth of the treated area is around 0.63 mm (0.025 in.); hardness depends on carbon content of the steel and can range up to 60 HRC [11]. \rElectron beam (EB) heating involves localized surface hardening of steel in which the electron beam is focused onto a small area, resulting in rapid heat buildup. Austenitizing temperatures can often be achieved in less than a second. When the directed beam is removed, the heated area is immediately quenched and hardened by heat transfer to the surrounding cold metal.

The beam is usually moved along a de\ufb01ned path on the work surface, causing heating of the steel into the austenite region. When the beam is moved, the area is immediately quenched by heat conduction to the surrounding metal. Laser is an acronym for light ampli\ufb01 cation by stimulated emission of radiation. The advantage of LB over EB heating is that laser beams do not require a vacuum to achieve best results.

The major categories of surface processing operations are (1) cleaning, (2) surface treatments, and (3) coating and thin \ufb01lm deposition. Cleaning refers to industrial cleaning processes that remove soils and contaminants that result from previous processing or the factory environment. They include both chemical and mechanical cleaning methods. Surface treatments are mechanical and physical operations that alter the part surface in some way, such as improving its \ufb01nish or impregnating it with atoms of a foreign material to change its chemistry and physical properties. \rCoating and thin \ufb01lm deposition include various processes that apply a layer of material to a surface. Products made of metal are almost always coated by electroplating (e.g., chrome plating), painting, or other process. Principal reasons for coating a metal are to \r(1) \rprovide corrosion protection, (2) enhance product appearance (e.g., providing a speci\ufb01ed color or texture), (3) increase wear resistance and/or reduce friction of the surface, (4) increase electrical conductivity, \r\r(5) \rincrease electrical resistance, (6) prepare a metallic surface for subsequent processing, and (7) rebuild surfaces worn or eroded during service. Nonmetallic materials are also sometimes coated. Examples include \r\r(1) \rplastic parts coated to give them a metallic appearance; (2) antire\ufb02ection coatings on optical glass lenses; and (3) certain coating and deposition processes used in the fabrication of semiconductor chips (Chapter 33) and printed circuit boards (Chapter 34). In all cases, good adhesion must be achieved between coating and substrate, and for this to occur the substrate surface must be very clean. \r\r\r\r Industrial Cleaning Processes  \rMost work parts must be cleaned one or more times during their manufacturing  \rsequence. Chemical and/or mechanical processes are used to accomplish this clean \ring. Chemical cleaning methods use chemicals to remove unwanted oils and soils  \rfrom the workpiece surface. Mechanical cleaning involves removal of substances  \rfrom a surface by mechanical operations of various kinds.

Just as various soaps and detergents are required for different household jobs (laundry, dishwashing, pot scrubbing, bathtub cleaning, and so forth), various cleaning methods are also needed to solve different cleaning problems in industry. Important factors in selecting a cleaning method are (1) the contaminant to be removed, (2) degree of cleanliness required, (3) substrate material to be cleaned, (4) purpose of the cleaning, (5) environmental and safety factors, (6) size and geometry of the part, and (7) production and cost requirements. \rVarious kinds of contaminants build up on part surfaces, either due to previous processing or the factory environment.To select the best cleaning method,one must \ufb01rst identify what must be cleaned. Surface contaminants found in the factory usually divide into one of the following categories: (1) oil and grease, which includes lubricants used in metalworking; (2) solid particles such as metal chips, abrasive grits, shop dirt, dust, and similar materials; (3) buf\ufb01ng and polishing compounds; and (4) oxide \ufb01lms, rust, and scale. \rDegree of cleanliness refers to the amount of contaminant remaining after a given cleaning operation. Parts being prepared to accept a coating (e.g., paint, metallic \ufb01lm) or adhesive must be very clean; otherwise, adhesion of the coated material is jeopardized. In other cases, it may be desirable for the cleaning operation to leave a residue on the part surface for corrosion protection during storage, in effect replacing one contaminant on the surface by another that is bene\ufb01 cial. Degree of cleanliness is often dif\ufb01cult to measure in a quanti\ufb01able way. A simple test is a wiping method, in which the surface is wiped with a clean white cloth, and the amount of soil absorbed by the cloth is observed. It is a nonquantitative but easy test to use. \rThe substrate material must be considered in selecting a cleaning method, so that damaging reactions are not caused by the cleaning chemicals. To cite several examples: aluminum is dissolved by most acids and alkalis; magnesium is attacked by many acids; copper is attacked by oxidizing acids (e.g., nitric acid); steels are resistant to alkalis but react with virtually all acids. \rSome cleaning methods are appropriate to prepare the surface for painting, while others are better for plating. Environmental protection and worker safety are becoming increasingly important in industrial processes. Cleaning methods and the associated chemicals should be selected to avoid pollution and health hazards. \rChemical Cleaning Processes Chemical cleaning uses various types of chemicals to effect contaminant removal from the surface. The major chemical cleaning methods are (1) alkaline cleaning, (2) emulsion cleaning, (3) solvent cleaning, (4) acid cleaning, and (5) ultrasonic cleaning. In some cases, chemical action is augmented by other energy forms; for example, ultrasonic cleaning uses high-frequency mechanical vibrations combined with chemical cleaning. \rAlkaline cleaning is the most widely used industrial cleaning method. As its name indicates, it employs an alkali to remove oils, grease, wax, and various types of particles (metal chips, silica, carbon, and light scale) from a metallic surface. Alkaline cleaning solutions consist of low-cost, water-soluble salts such as sodium and potassium hydroxide (NaOH, KOH), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), borax (Na2B4O7), phosphates and silicates of sodium and potassium, combined with dispersants and surfactants in water. The cleaning method is commonly accomplished by immersion or spraying, usually at temperatures of 50\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C (120\u00b0F\u2013200\u00b0F).

Following application of the alkaline solution, a water rinse is used to remove the alkali residue. Metal surfaces cleaned by alkaline solutions are typically electroplated or conversion coated. \rElectrolytic cleaning, also called electrocleaning, is a related process in which a 3\u201312-V direct current is applied to an alkaline cleaning solution. The electrolytic action results in the generation of gas bubbles at the part surface, causing a scrubbing action that aids in removal of tenacious dirt \ufb01lms. \rEmulsion cleaning uses organic solvents (oils) dispersed in an aqueous solution. The use of suitable emulsi\ufb01ers (soaps) results in a two-phase cleaning \ufb02uid (oil-in-water), which functions by dissolving or emulsifying the soils on the part surface. The process can be used on either metal or nonmetallic parts. Emulsion cleaning must be followed by alkaline cleaning to eliminate all residues of the organic solvent prior to plating. \rIn solvent cleaning, organic soils such as oil and grease are removed from a metallic surface by means of chemicals that dissolve the soils. Common application techniques include hand-wiping, immersion, spraying, and vapor degreasing. Vapor degreasing uses hot vapors of solvents to dissolve and remove oil and grease on part surfaces. The common solvents include trichlorethylene (C2HCl3), methylene chloride (CH2Cl2), and perchlorethylene (C2Cl4), all of which have relatively low boiling points.1 The vapor degreasing process consists of heating the liquid solvent to its boiling point in a container to produce hot vapors. Parts to be cleaned are then introduced into the vapor, which condenses on the relatively cold part surfaces, dissolving the contaminants and dripping to the bottom of the container. Condensing coils near \r1The highest boiling point of the three solvents is 121\u00b0C (250\u00b0F) for C2Cl4. \rthe top of the container prevent any vapors from escaping the container into the surrounding atmosphere. This is important because these solvents are classi\ufb01ed as hazardous air pollutants under the 1992 Clean Air Act [10]. \rAcid cleaning removes oils and light oxides from metal surfaces by soaking, spraying, or manual brushing or wiping. The process is carried out at ambient or elevated temperatures. Common cleaning \ufb02 uids are acid solutions combined with water-miscible solvents, wetting and emulsifying agents. Cleaning acids include hydrochloric (HCl), nitric (HNO3), phosphoric (H3PO4), and sulfuric (H2SO4), the selection depending on the base metal and purpose of the cleaning. For example, phosphoric acid produces a light phosphate \ufb01 lm on the metallic surface, which can be a useful preparation for painting.A closely related cleaning process is acid pickling, which involves a more severe treatment to remove thicker oxides, rusts, and scales; it generally results in some etching of the metallic surface, which serves to improve organic paint adhesion. \rUltrasonic cleaning combines chemical cleaning and mechanical agitation of the cleaning \ufb02uid to provide a highly effective method for removing surface contaminants. The cleaning \ufb02 uid is generally an aqueous solution containing alkaline detergents. The mechanical agitation is produced by high-frequency vibrations of suf\ufb01 cient amplitude to cause cavitation\u2014formation of low-pressure vapor bubbles or cavities.As the vibration wave passes a given point in the liquid,the low-pressure region is followed by a high-pressure front that implodes the cavity, thereby producing a shock wave capable of penetrating contaminant particles adhering to the work surface.

The cleaning process is performed at frequencies between 20 and 45 kHz, and the cleaning solution is usually at an elevated temperature, typically 65\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C (150\u00b0F\u2013190\u00b0F). \r\r\r27.1.2 MECHANICAL CLEANING AND SURFACE TREATMENTS \rMechanical cleaning involves the physical removal of soils, scales, or \ufb01lms from the work surface of the work part by means of abrasives or similar mechanical action. The processes used for mechanical cleaning often serve other functions in addition to cleaning, such as deburring and improving surface \ufb01nish. \rBlast Finishing and Shot Peening Blast \ufb01nishing uses the high-velocity impact of particulate media to clean and \ufb01nish a surface. The most well known of these methods is sand blasting, which uses grits of sand (SiO2) as the blasting media. Various other media are also used in blast \ufb01nishing, including hard abrasives such as aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and silicon carbide (SiC), and soft media such as nylon beads and crushed nut shells. The media is propelled at the target surface by pressurized air or centrifugal force. In some applications, the process is performed wet, in which \ufb01ne particles in a water slurry are directed under hydraulic pressure at the surface. \rIn shot peening, a high-velocity stream of small cast steel pellets (called shot) is directed at a metallic surface with the effect of cold working and inducing compressive stresses into the surface layers. Shot peening is used primarily to improve fatigue strength of metal parts. Its purpose is therefore different from blast \ufb01nishing, although surface cleaning is accomplished as a by-product of the operation. \rFIGURE 27.1 Diagramof tumbling (barrel\ufb01nishing) operation showing \u201clandslide\u201daction of parts andabrasive media to \ufb01nish the parts. \r\rTumbling and Other Mass Finishing Tumbling, vibratory \ufb01nishing, and similar operations comprise a group of \ufb01nishing processes known as mass \ufb01 nishing methods. Mass \ufb01 nishing involves the \ufb01nishing of parts in bulk by a mixing action inside a container, usually in the presence of an abrasive media. The mixing causes the parts to rub against the media and each other to achieve the desired \ufb01nishing action. Mass \ufb01 nishing methods are used for deburring, descaling, de\ufb02 ashing, polishing, radiusing, burnishing, and cleaning. The parts include stampings, castings, forgings, extrusions, and machined parts. Even plastic and ceramic parts are sometimes subjected to these mass \ufb01nishing operations to achieve desired \ufb01nishing results. The parts processed by these methods are usually small and are therefore uneconomical to \ufb01 nish individually. \rMass \ufb01nishing methods include tumbling, vibratory \ufb01nishing, and several techniques that utilize centrifugal force. Tumbling (also called barrel \ufb01 nishing and tumbling barrel \ufb01 nishing) involves the use of a horizontally oriented barrel of hexagonal or octagonal cross-section in which parts are mixed by rotating the barrel at speeds of 10\u201350 rev/min. Finishing is performed by a \u201clandslide\u201d action of the media and parts as the barrel revolves. As pictured in Figure 27.1, the contents rise in the barrel due to rotation, followed by a tumbling down of the top layer due to gravity. This cycle of rising and tumbling occurs continuously and, over time, subjects all of the parts to the same desired \ufb01nishing action. However, because only the top layer of parts is being \ufb01nished at any moment, barrel \ufb01nishing is a relatively slow process compared to other mass \ufb01nishing methods.

Other drawbacks of barrel \ufb01 nishing include high noise levels and large \ufb02 oor space requirements. \rVibratory \ufb01 nishing was introduced in the late 1950s as an alternative to tumbling. The vibrating vessel subjects all parts to agitation with the abrasive media, as opposed to only the top layer as in barrel \ufb01nishing. Consequently, processing times for vibratory \ufb01nishing are signi\ufb01cantly reduced. The open tubs used in this method permit inspection of the parts during processing, and noise is reduced. \rMost of the media in these operations are abrasive; however, some media perform nonabrasive \ufb01nishing operations such as burnishing and surface hardening. The media may be natural or synthetic materials. Natural media include corundum, granite,limestone,and even hardwood.The problem with these materials is that they are generally softer (and therefore wear more rapidly) and nonuniform in size (and sometimes clog in the work parts). Synthetic media can be made with greater consistency, both in size and hardness. These materials include Al2O3 and SiC, compacted into a desired shape and size using a bonding material such as a polyester resin.

Selection of media is based on part size and shape, as well as \ufb01 nishing requirements. \rIn most mass \ufb01nishing processes, a compound is used with the media. The mass \ufb01nishing compound is a combination of chemicals for speci\ufb01c functions such as cleaning, cooling, rust inhibiting (of steel parts and steel media), and enhancing brightness and color of the parts (especially in burnishing). \r\r\r\rDiffusion and Ion Implantation \rThis section discusses two processes in which the surface of a substrate is impregnated with foreign atoms that alter its chemistry and properties. \r27.2.1 DIFFUSION \rDiffusion involves the alteration of surface layers of a material by diffusing atoms of a different material (usually an element) into the surface (Section 4.3). The diffusion process impregnates the surface layers of the substrate with the foreign element,but the surface still contains a high proportion of substrate material.A typical pro\ufb01le of composition as a function of depth below the surface for a diffusion coated metal part is illustrated in Figure 27.3. The characteristic of a diffusion impregnated surface is that the diffused element has a maximum percentage at the surface and rapidly declines with distance below the surface.The diffusion process has important applications in metallurgy and semiconductor manufacture. \rIn metallurgical applications, diffusion is used to alter the surface chemistry of metals in a number of processes and treatments. One important example is surface hardening, typi\ufb01ed by carburizing, nitriding, carbonitriding, chromizing, and boronizing (Section 27.4). In these treatments, one or more elements (C and/or Ni, Cr, or Bo) are diffused into the surface of iron or steel. \rThere are other diffusion processes in which corrosion resistance and/or high-temperature oxidation resistance are main objectives.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 14200, "end_char_idx": 18562, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7927607b-7b7a-41b1-923e-1fa21d564a7b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7927607b-7b7a-41b1-923e-1fa21d564a7b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec27.txt", "file_name": "sec27.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 73554, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "df3d474f-801f-414a-9378-f51ba0b4fead", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec27.txt", "file_name": "sec27.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 73554, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "81472c3fca00d44c93e372099f0cc5a230913a0b52ae65aa32d0e9890e575768", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9ce17ea-acbc-4a19-9406-0b69ee2e72ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec27.txt", "file_name": "sec27.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 73554, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "6f25d9193deeebd0cb627a06bdddc31877b1eb2589cdbb7607cadb98da5c9b2f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4baf2c7a-e58e-4447-89d6-f270729f3cdb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b25b37772adc7933a6d00bf68e94595c45d856e8ed8d5521187da564f70e90f4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The characteristic of a diffusion impregnated surface is that the diffused element has a maximum percentage at the surface and rapidly declines with distance below the surface.The diffusion process has important applications in metallurgy and semiconductor manufacture. \rIn metallurgical applications, diffusion is used to alter the surface chemistry of metals in a number of processes and treatments.

Aluminizing, and siliconizing are important examples. Aluminizing, also known as calorizing, involves diffusion of aluminum into carbon steel,alloy steels,and alloys of nickel and cobalt.The treatment is accomplished by either (1) pack diffusion, in which work parts are packed with Al powders and baked at high temperature to create the diffusion layer; or (2) a slurry method, in which the work parts are dipped or sprayed with a mixture of Al powders and binders, then dried and baked. \r\rSiliconizing is a treatment of steel in which silicon is diffused into the part surface to create a layer with good corrosion and wear resistance and moderate heat resistance. The treatment is carried out by heating the work in powders of silicon carbide (SiC) in an atmosphere containing vapors of silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4). Siliconizing is less common than aluminizing. \rSemiconductor Applications In semiconductor processing, diffusion of an impurity element into the surface of a silicon chip is used to change the electrical properties at the surface to create devices such as transistors and diodes. How diffusion is used to accomplish this doping, as it is called, and other semiconductor processes is examined in Chapter 33. \r\r27.2.2 ION IMPLANTATION \rIon implantation is an alternative to diffusion when the latter method is not feasible because of the high temperatures required. The ion implantation process involves embedding atoms of one (or more) foreign element(s) into a substrate surface using a high-energy beam of ionized particles. The result is an alteration of the chemical and physical properties of the layers near the substrate surface. Penetration of atoms produces a much thinner altered layer than diffusion, as indicated by a comparison of Figures 27.3 and 27.4. Also, the concentration pro\ufb01le of the impregnated element is quite different from the characteristic diffusion pro\ufb01le. \rAdvantages of ion implantation include (1) low-temperature processing, (2) good control and reproducibility of penetration depth of impurities, and (3) solubility limits can be exceeded without precipitation of excess atoms. Ion implantation \ufb01nds some of its applications as a substitute for certain coating processes, where its advantages include (4) no problems with waste disposal as in electroplating and \r\rFIGURE 27.4 Pro\ufb01le of surface chemistry as treated by ion implantation.

The \r\rFIGURE 27.5 \rSetup forelectroplating. \r\relectrolyte is an aqueous solution of acids, bases, or salts; it conducts electric current by the movement of plate metal ions in solution. For optimum results, parts must be chemically cleaned just prior to electroplating. \rPrinciples of Electroplating Electrochemical plating is based on Faraday\u2019s two physical laws. Brie\ufb02y, the laws state: (1) the mass of a substance liberated in electrolysis is proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the cell; and (2) the mass of the material liberated is proportional to its electrochemical equivalent (ratio of atomic weight to valence). The effects can be summarized in the equation\r V ! CIt (27.1) \rwhere V  volume of metal plated, mm3 (in3); C  plating constant, which depends on electrochemical equivalent and density, mm3/amp-s (in3/amp-min); I  current, amps; and t  time during which current is applied, s (min).The product It (current  time) is the electrical charge passed in the cell, and the value of C indicates the amount of plating material deposited onto the cathodic work part per electrical charge. \rFor most plating metals, not all of the electrical energy in the process is used for deposition; some energy may be consumed in other reactions, such as the liberation of hydrogen at the cathode.This reduces the amount of metal plated.The actual amount of metal deposited on the cathode (work part) divided by the theoretical amount given by Equation (27.1) is called the cathode ef\ufb01 ciency. Taking the cathode ef\ufb01 ciency into account, a more realistic equation for determining the volume of metal plated is\r V ! ECIt (27.2) \rwhere E ! cathode ef\ufb01ciency,and the other terms are de\ufb01ned as before.Typical values of cathode ef\ufb01ciency E and plating constant C for different metals are presented in Table 27.1.

The principal methods are (1) barrel plating, (2) rack plating, and \r(3) strip plating. Barrel plating is performed in rotating barrels that are oriented either horizontally or at an oblique angle (35\u00b0). The method is suited to the plating of many small parts in a batch. Electrical contact is maintained through the tumbling action of the parts themselves and by means of an externally connected conductor that projects into the barrel. There are limitations to barrel plating; the tumbling action inherent in the process may damage soft metal parts, threaded components, parts requiring good \ufb01nishes, and heavy parts with sharp edges. \rRack plating is used for parts that are too large, heavy, or complex for barrel plat-ing.The racks are made of heavy-gauge copper wire,formed into suitable shapes for holding the parts and conducting current to them. The racks are fabricated so that work parts can be hung on hooks, or held by clips, or loaded into baskets. To avoid plating of the copper itself, the racks are covered with insulation except in locations where part contact occurs. The racks containing the parts are moved through a sequence of tanks that perform the electroplating operation. Strip plating is a high-production method in which the work consists of a continuous strip that is pulled through the plating solution by means of a take-up reel. Plated wire is an example of a suitable application. Small sheet-metal parts held in a long strip can also be plated by this method. The process can be set up so that only speci\ufb01c regions of the parts are plated, for example, contact points plated with gold on electrical connectors. \rCommon coating metals in electroplating include zinc, nickel, tin, copper, and chromium.

The process can be set up so that only speci\ufb01c regions of the parts are plated, for example, contact points plated with gold on electrical connectors. \rCommon coating metals in electroplating include zinc, nickel, tin, copper, and chromium. Steel is the most common substrate metal. Precious metals (gold, silver, platinum) are plated on jewelry. Gold is also used for electrical contacts. \rZinc-plated steel products include fasteners, wire goods, electric switch boxes, and various sheet-metal parts. The zinc coating serves as a sacri\ufb01cial barrier to the corrosion of the steel beneath. An alternative process for coating zinc onto steel is galvanizing (Section 27.3.4). Nickel plating is used for corrosion resistance and decorative purposes over steel, brass, zinc die castings, and other metals. Applications include automotive trim and other consumer goods. Nickel is also used as a base coat under a much thinner chrome plate. Tin plate is still widely used for corrosion protection in \u201ctin cans\u201d and other food containers. Tin plate is also used to improve solderability of electrical components. \rCopper has several important applications as a plating metal. It is widely used as a decorative coating on steel and zinc, either alone or alloyed with zinc as brass plate. It also has important plating applications in printed circuit boards (Section 34.2). Finally, copper is often plated on steel as a base beneath nickel and/or chrome plate. Chromium plate (popularly known as chrome plate) is valued for its decorative appearance and is widely used in automotive products, of\ufb01ce furniture, and kitchen appliances. It also produces one of the hardest of all electroplated coatings, and so it is widely used for parts requiring wear resistance (e.g., hydraulic pistons and cylinders, piston rings, aircraft engine components, and thread guides in textile machinery). \r\r27.3.2 ELECTROFORMING \rThis process is virtually the same as electroplating but its purpose is quite different. Electroforming involves electrolytic deposition of metal onto a pattern until the required thickness is achieved; the pattern is then removed to leave the formed part. Whereas typical plating thickness is only about 0.05 mm (0.002 in) or less, electroformed parts are often substantially thicker, so the production cycle is proportionally longer. \rPatterns used in electroforming are either solid or expendable. Solid patterns have a taper or other geometry that permits removal of the electroplated part. Expendable patterns are destroyed during part removal; they are used when part shape precludes a solid pattern. Expendable patterns are either fusible or soluble. The fusible type is made of low-melting alloys, plastic, wax, or other material that can be removed by melting. When nonconductive materials are used, the pattern must be metallized to accept the electrodeposited coating. Soluble patterns are made of a material that can be readily dissolved by chemicals; for example, aluminum can be dissolved in sodium hydroxide (NaOH). \rElectroformed parts are commonly fabricated of copper, nickel, and nickel cobalt alloys.

Deposition of metal onto a part surface occurs in an aqueous solution containing ions of the desired plating metal. The process uses a reducing agent, and the work part surface acts as a catalyst for the reaction. \rThe metals that can be electroless plated are limited; and for those that can be processed by this technique, the cost is generally greater than electrochemical plating. The most common electroless plating metal is nickel and certain of its alloys (Ni\u2013Co, Ni\u2013P, and Ni\u2013B). Copper and, to a lesser degree, gold are also used as plating metals. Nickel plating by this process is used for applications requiring high resistance to corrosion and wear. Electroless copper plating is used to plate through holes of printed circuit boards (Section 34.2.3). Cu can also be plated onto plastic parts for decorative purposes. Advantages sometimes cited for electroless plating include \r(1) \runiform plate thickness on complex part geometries (a problem with electroplating); (2) the process can be used on both metallic and nonmetallic substrates; and \r\r(3)\r no need for a DC power supply to drive the process. \r\r\r\r27.3.4 HOT DIPPING \r\rHot dipping is a process in which a metal substrate is immersed in a molten bath of a second metal; upon removal, the second metal is coated onto the \ufb01rst. Of course, the \ufb01rst metal must possess a higher melting temperature than the second.The most common substrate metals are steel and iron. Zinc, aluminum, tin, and lead are the common coating metals. Hot dipping works by forming transition layers of varying alloy compositions. Next to the substrate are normally intermetallic compounds of the two metals; at the exterior are solid solution alloys consisting predominantly of the coating metal. The transition layers provide excellent adhesion of the coating. \rThe primary purpose of hot dipping is corrosion protection.Two mechanisms normally operate to provide this protection: (1) barrier protection\u2014the coating simply serves as a shield for the metal beneath; and (2) sacri\ufb01cial protection\u2014the coating corrodes by a slow electrochemical process to preserve the substrate. \rHot dipping goes by different names, depending on coating metal: galvanizing is when zinc (Zn) is coated onto steel or iron; aluminizing refers to coating of aluminum (Al) onto a substrate; tinning is coating of tin (Sn); and terneplate describes the plating of lead\u2013tin (Pb-Sn) alloy onto steel. Galvanizing is by far the most important hot dipping process, dating back about 200 years. It is applied to \ufb01 nished steel and iron parts in a batch process; and to sheet, strip, piping, tubing, and wire in an automated continuous process. Coating thickness is typically 0.04 to 0.09 mm (0.0016\u20130.0035 in). Thickness is controlled largely by immersion time. Bath temperature is maintained at around 450\u00b0C (850\u00b0F). \rCommercial use of aluminizing is on the rise, gradually increasing in market share relative to galvanizing. Hot-dipped aluminum coatings provide excellent corrosion protection, in some cases \ufb01ve times more effective than galvanizing [17]. Tin plating by hot dipping provides a nontoxic corrosion protection for steel in applications for food containers, dairy equipment, and soldering applications.

Immersion and spraying are the two common methods of exposing the metal surface to the reacting chemicals. The common metals treated by conversion coating are steel (including galvanized steel), zinc, and aluminum. However, nearly any metal product can bene\ufb01t from the treatment. The important reasons for using a conversion coating process are (1) to provide corrosion protection, (2) to prepare the surface for painting, (3) to increase wear resistance, (4) to permit the surface to better hold lubricants for metal forming processes, (5) to increase electrical resistance of surface, (6) to provide a decorative \ufb01nish, and (7) for part identi\ufb01cation [17]. \rConversion coating processes divide into two categories: (1) chemical treatments, which involve a chemical reaction only, and (2) anodizing, which consists of an electrochemical reaction to produce an oxide coating (anodize is a contraction of anodic oxidize). \r27.4.1 CHEMICAL CONVERSION COATINGS \rThese processes expose the base metal to certain chemicals that form thin, nonmetallic surface \ufb01lms. Similar reactions occur in nature; the oxidation of iron and aluminum are examples.Whereas rusting is progressively destructive of iron,formation of a thin Al2O3 coating on aluminum protects the base metal. It is the purpose of these chemical conversion treatments to accomplish the latter effect. The two main processes are phosphate and chromate coating. \rPhosphate coating transforms the base metal surface into a protective phosphate \ufb01lm by exposure to solutions of certain phosphate salts (e.g., Zn, Mg, and Ca) together with dilute phosphoric acid (H3PO4). The coatings range in thickness from 0.0025 to 0.05 mm (0.0001\u20130.002 in). The most common base metals are zinc and steel, including galvanized steel. The phosphate coating serves as a useful preparation for painting in the automotive and heavy appliance industries. \rChromate coating converts the base metal into various forms of chromate \ufb01 lms using aqueous solutions of chromic acid, chromate salts, and other chemicals. Metals treated by this method include aluminum, cadmium, copper, magnesium, and zinc (and their alloys). Immersion of the base part is the common method of \rtypically less than 0.0025 mm (0.0001 in). Usual reasons for chromate coating are \r(1) corrosion protection, (2) base for painting, and (3) decorative purposes. Chromate coatings can be clear or colorful; available colors include olive drab, bronze, yellow, or bright blue. \r\r27.4.2 ANODIZING \r,phosphatethansomewhatthinnerarecoatingsconversionChromate . application \rAlthough the previous processes are normally performed without electrolysis, anodizing is an electrolytic treatment that produces a stable oxide layer on a metallic surface.

In anodizing, the surface coating is formed through chemical reaction of the substrate metal into an oxide layer. \rAnodized coatings usually range in thickness between 0.0025 and 0.075 mm (0.0001 and 0.003 in). Dyes can be incorporated into the anodizing process to create a wide variety of colors; this is especially common in aluminum anodizing. Very thick coatings up to 0.25 mm (0.010 in) can also be formed on aluminum by a special process called hard anodizing; these coatings are noted for high resistance to wear and corrosion. \r\r\r\rVapor Deposition Processes \rThe vapor deposition processes form a thin coating on a substrate by either condensation or chemical reaction of a gas onto the surface of the substrate. The two categories of processes that fall under this heading are physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition. \r27.5.1 PHYSICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION \rPhysical vapor deposition (PVD) is a group of thin \ufb01lm processes in which a material is converted into its vapor phase in a vacuum chamber and condensed onto a substrate surface as a very thin layer. PVD can be used to apply a wide variety of coating materials: metals, alloys, ceramics and other inorganic compounds, and even certain polymers. Possible substrates include metals, glass, and plastics. Thus, PVD represents a versatile coating technology, applicable to an almost unlimited combination of coating substances and substrate materials. \rApplications of PVD include thin decorative coatings on plastic and metal parts such as trophies, toys, pens and pencils, watchcases, and interior trim in automobiles. The coatings are thin \ufb01lms of aluminum (around 150 nm) coated with clear lacquer to give a high gloss silver or chrome appearance. Another use of PVD is to apply antire\ufb02ection coatings of magnesium \ufb02 uoride (MgF2) onto optical lenses. PVD is applied in the fabrication of electronic devices, principally for depositing metal to form electrical connections in integrated circuits. Finally, PVD is widely used to coat titanium nitride (TiN) onto cutting tools and plastic injection molds for wear resistance. \rAll physical vapor deposition processes consist of the following steps: (1) synthesis of the coating vapor, (2) vapor transport to the substrate, and (3) condensation of vapors onto the substrate surface. These steps are generally carried out inside a vacuum chamber, so evacuation of the chamber must precede the actual PVD process. \rSynthesis of the coating vapor can be accomplished by any of several methods, such as electric resistance heating or ion bombardment to vaporize an existing solid (or liquid). These and other variations result in several PVD processes. They are grouped into three principal types: (1) vacuum evaporation, (2) sputtering, and (3) ion plating. Table 27.2 presents a summary of these processes. \rVacuum Evaporation Certain materials (mostly pure metals) can be deposited onto a substrate by \ufb01rst transforming them from solid to vapor state in a vacuum and then letting them condense on the substrate surface. The setup for the vacuum evaporation process is shown in Figure 27.6.The material to be deposited,called the source, is heated to a suf\ufb01ciently high temperature that it evaporates (or sublimes).

Also, the absence of air in the chamber prevents oxidation of the source material at the heating temperatures. \rVarious methods can be used to heat and vaporize the material.A container must be provided to hold the source material before vaporization. Among the important vaporization methods are resistance heating and electron beam bombardment. Resistance heating is the simplest technology. A refractory metal (e.g., W, Mo) is formed into a suitable container to hold the source material. Current is applied to heat the container, which then heats the material in contact with it. One problem with this heating method is possible alloying between the holder and its contents, so that the deposited \ufb01lm becomes contaminated with the metal of the resistance heating container. In electron beam evaporation, a stream of electrons at high velocity is directed to bombard the surface of the source material to cause vaporization. By contrast with resistance heating, very little energy acts to heat the container, thus minimizing contamination of the container material with the coating. \rWhatever the vaporization technique, evaporated atoms leave the source and follow straight-line paths until they collide with other gas molecules or strike a solid surface. The vacuum inside the chamber virtually eliminates other gas molecules, thus reducing the probability of collisions with source vapor atoms. The substrate surface to be coated is usually positioned relative to the source so that it \r\rFIGURE 27.7 \rOne possible setup for sputtering, a form of physical vapor deposition. \ris the likely solid surface on which the vapor atoms will be deposited. A mechanical manipulator is sometimes used to rotate the substrate so that all surfaces are coated. Upon contact with the relative cool substrate surface, the energy level of the impinging atoms is suddenly reduced to the point where they cannot remain in a vapor state; they condense and become attached to the solid surface, forming a deposited thin \ufb01 lm. \rSputtering If the surface of a solid (or liquid) is bombarded by atomic particles of suf\ufb01ciently high energy, individual atoms of the surface may acquire enough energy due to the collision that they are ejected from the surface by transfer of momentum. This is the process known as sputtering.

This is the process known as sputtering. The most convenient form of high energy particle is an ionized gas, such as argon, energized by means of an electric \ufb01eld to form a plasma.As a PVD process, sputtering involves bombardment of the cathodic coating material with argon ions (Ar), causing surface atoms to escape and then be deposited onto a substrate, forming a thin \ufb01lm on the substrate surface. The substrate must be placed close to the cathode and is usually heated to improve bonding of the coating atoms. A typical arrangement is shown in Figure 27.7. \rWhereas vacuum evaporation is generally limited to metals, sputtering can be applied to nearly any material\u2014metallic and nonmetallic elements; alloys, ceramics, and polymers. Films of alloys and compounds can be sputtered without changing their chemical compositions. Films of chemical compounds can also be deposited by employing reactive gases that form oxides, carbides, or nitrides with the sputtered metal. \rDrawbacks of sputtering PVD include (1) slow deposition rates and (2) because the ions bombarding the surface are a gas, traces of the gas can usually be found in the coated \ufb01lms, and the entrapped gases sometimes affect mechanical properties adversely. \rIon Plating Ion plating uses a combination of sputtering and vacuum evaporation to deposit a thin \ufb01lm onto a substrate. The process works as follows. The substrate is set up to be the cathode in the upper part of the chamber, and the source material is placed below it. A vacuum is then established in the chamber. Argon gas is admitted and an electric \ufb01eld is applied to ionize the gas (Ar) and establish a plasma.This results in ion bombardment (sputtering) of the substrate so that its surface is scrubbed to a condition of atomic cleanliness (interpret this as \u201cvery clean\u201d). \r\rNext,the source material is heated suf\ufb01ciently to generate coating vapors.The heating methods used here are similar to those used in vacuum evaporation: resistance heating, electron beam bombardment, and so on. The vapor molecules pass through the plasma and coat the substrate. Sputtering is continued during deposition, so that the ion bombardment consists not only of the original argon ions but also source material ions that have been energized while being subjected to the same energy \ufb01eld as the argon. The effect of these processing conditions is to produce \ufb01lms of uniform thickness and excellent adherence to the substrate. \rIon plating is applicable to parts having irregular geometries, due to the scattering effects that exist in the plasma \ufb01 eld. An example of interest here is TiN coating of high-speed steel cutting tools (e.g., drill bits). In addition to coating uniformity and good adherence, other advantages of the process include high deposition rates, high \ufb01lm densities, and the capability to coat the inside walls of holes and other hollow shapes. \r\r27.5.2 CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION \rPhysical vapor deposition involves deposition of a coating by condensation onto a substrate from the vapor phase; it is strictly a physical process. By comparison, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) involves the interaction between a mixture of gases and the surface of a heated substrate, causing chemical decomposition of some of the gas constituents and formation of a solid \ufb01lm on the substrate. The reactions take place in an enclosed reaction chamber. The reaction product (either a metal or a compound) nucleates and grows on the substrate surface to form the coating. Most CVD reactions require heat. However, depending on the chemicals involved, the reactions can be driven by other possible energy sources, such as ultraviolet light or plasma. CVD includes a wide range of pressures and temperatures; and it can be applied to a great variety of coating and substrate materials. \rIndustrial metallurgical processes based on chemical vapor deposition date back to the 1800s (e.g., the Mond process in Table 27.3). Modern interest in CVD is focused on its coating applications such as coated cemented carbide tools, solar cells, depositing refractory metals on jet engine turbine blades, and other applications where resistance to wear, corrosion, erosion, and thermal shock are important.

For many reactions, there are advantages in performing the process at pressures well below atmospheric. This is called low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), in which the reactions occur in a partial vacuum. Advantages of LPCVD include (1) uniform thickness, (2) good control over composition and structure, (3) low-temperature processing, (4) fast deposition rates, and (5) high throughput and lower processing costs [13]. The technical problem in LPCVD is designing the vacuum pumps to create the partial vacuum when the reaction products are not only hot but may also be corrosive. These pumps must often include systems to cool and trap the corrosive gases before they reach the actual pumping unit. \rAnother variation of CVD is plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition (PACVD), in which deposition onto a substrate is accomplished by reacting the ingredients in a gas that has been ionized by means of an electric discharge (i.e., a plasma). In effect, the energy contained in the plasma rather than thermal energy is used to activate the chemical reactions.Advantages of PACVD include (1) lower substrate temperatures, (2) better covering power, (3) better adhesion, and (4) faster deposition rates [6]. Applications include deposition of silicon nitride (Si3N4) in semiconductor processing, TiN and TiC coatings for tools, and polymer coatings. The process is also known as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, plasma chemical vapor deposition, or just simply plasma deposition. \r\r\rOrganic Coatings \rOrganic coatings are polymers and resins, produced either naturally or synthetically, usually formulated to be applied as liquids that dry or harden as thin surface \ufb01lms on substrate materials. These coatings are valued for the variety of colors and textures possible, their capacity to protect the substrate surface, low cost, and ease with which they can be applied. This section considers the compositions of organic coatings and the methods to apply them. Although most organic coatings are applied in liquid form, some are applied as powders, and this alternative is covered in Section 27.6.2. \rOrganic coatings are formulated to contain the following: (1) binders, which give the coating its properties; (2) dyes or pigments, which lend color to the coating; (3) solvents, to dissolve the polymers and resins and add proper \ufb02uidity to the liquid; and (4) additives. \rBinders in organic coatings are polymers and resins that determine the solid-state properties of the coating, such as strength, physical properties, and adhesion to the substrate surface. The binder holds the pigments and other ingredients in the coating during and after application to the surface.The most common binders in organic coatings are natural oils (used to produce oil-based paints), and resins of polyesters, polyurethanes, epoxies, acrylics, and cellulosics. \rDyes and pigments provide color to the coating. Dyes are soluble chemicals that color the coating liquid but do not conceal the surface beneath. Thus, dye-colored coatings are generally transparent or translucent. Pigments are solid particles of uniform, microscopic size that are dispersed in the coating liquid but insoluble in it. They not only color the coating; they also hide the surface below.

Because pigments are particulate matter, they also tend to strengthen the coating. \rSolvents are used to dissolve the binder and certain other ingredients in the liquid coating composition. Common solvents used in organic coatings are aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, esters, ketones, and chlorinated solvents. Different solvents are required for different binders. Additives in organic coatings include surfactants (to facilitate spreading on the surface), biocides and fungicides, thickeners, freeze/thaw stabilizers, heat and light stabilizers, coalescing agents, plasticizers, defoamers, and catalysts to promote cross-linking. These ingredients are formulated to obtain a wide variety of coatings, such as paints, lacquers, and varnishes. \r27.6.1 APPLICATION METHODS \rThe method of applying an organic coating to a surface depends on factors such as composition of the coating liquid, required thickness of the coating, production rate and cost considerations, part size, and environmental requirements. For any of the application methods, it is of utmost importance that the surface be properly prepared. This includes cleaning and possible treatment of the surface such as phosphate coating. In some cases, metallic surfaces are plated prior to organic coating for maximum corrosion protection. \rWith any coating method, transfer ef\ufb01ciency is a critical measure. Transfer ef\ufb01 ciency is the proportion of paint supplied to the process that is actually deposited onto the work surface. Some methods yield as low as a 30% transfer ef\ufb01ciency (meaning that 70% of the paint is wasted and cannot be recovered). \rAvailable methods of applying liquid organic coatings include brushing and rolling, spray coating, immersion, and \ufb02ow coating. In some cases, several successive coatings are applied to the substrate surface to achieve the desired result. An automobile car body is an important example; the following is a typical sequence applied to the sheet-metal car body in a mass-production automobile: (1) phosphate coat applied by dipping, (2) primer coat applied by dipping, (3) color paint coat applied by spray coating, and (4) clear coat (for high gloss and added protection) applied by spraying. \rBrushing and rolling are the two most familiar application methods to most people. They have a high transfer ef\ufb01ciency\u2014approaching 100%. Manual brushing and rolling methods are suited to low production but not mass production. While brushing is quite versatile, rolling is limited to \ufb02at surfaces. \rSpray coating is a widely used production method for applying organic coatings. The process forces the coating liquid to atomize into a \ufb01ne mist immediately prior to deposition onto the part surface. When the droplets hit the surface, they spread and \ufb02ow together to form a uniform coating within the localized region of the spray. If done properly, spray coating provides a uniform coating over the entire work surface. \rSpray coating can be performed manually in spray painting booths, or it can be set up as an automated process. Transfer ef\ufb01ciency is relatively low (as low as 30%) with these methods. Ef\ufb01ciency can be improved by electrostatic spraying, in which the work part is grounded electrically and the atomized droplets are electrostatically charged.This causes the droplets to be drawn to the part surfaces,increasing transfer ef\ufb01ciencies to values up to 90% [17].

Ef\ufb01ciency can be improved by electrostatic spraying, in which the work part is grounded electrically and the atomized droplets are electrostatically charged.This causes the droplets to be drawn to the part surfaces,increasing transfer ef\ufb01ciencies to values up to 90% [17]. Spraying is utilized extensively in the automotive industry for applying external paint coats to car bodies. It is also used for coating appliances and other consumer products. \rImmersion applies large amounts of liquid coating to the work part and allows the excess to drain off and be recycled. The simplest method is dip coating, in which a part is immersed in an open tank of liquid coating material; when the part is withdrawn, the excess liquid drains back into the tank. A variation of dip coating is electrocoating, in which the part is electrically charged and then dipped into a paint bath that has been given an opposite charge. This improves adhesion and permits use of water-based paints (which reduce \ufb01re and pollution hazards). \rIn \ufb02 ow coating, work parts are moved through an enclosed paint booth, where \ra series of nozzles shower the coating liquid onto the part surfaces. Excess liquid \rdrains back into a sump, which allows it to be reused. \rOnce applied, the organic coating must convert from liquid to solid. The term drying is often used to describe this conversion process. Many organic coatings dry by evaporation of their solvents. However, in order to form a durable \ufb01lm on the substrate surface, a further conversion is necessary, called curing. Curing involves a chemical change in the organic resin in which polymerization or cross-linking occurs to harden the coating. \rThe type of resin determines the type of chemical reaction that takes place in curing. The principal methods by which curing is effected in organic coatings are \r[17] (1) ambient temperature curing, which involves evaporation of the solvent and oxidation of the resin (most lacquers cure by this method); (2) elevated temperature curing, in which elevated temperatures are used to accelerate solvent evaporation, as well as polymerization and cross-linking of the resin; (3) catalytic curing, in which the starting resins require reactive agents mixed immediately prior to application to bring about polymerization and cross-linking (epoxy and polyurethane paints are examples); and (4) radiation curing, in which various forms of radiation, such as microwaves, ultraviolet light, and electron beams, are required to cure the resin. \r\r27.6.2 POWDER COATING \rThe organic coatings discussed above are liquid systems consisting of resins that are soluble (or at least miscible) in a suitable solvent. Powder coatings are different. They are applied as dry, \ufb01nely pulverized, solid particles that are melted on the surface to form a uniform liquid \ufb01lm, after which they resolidify into a dry coating. Powder coating systems have grown signi\ufb01cantly in commercial importance among organic coatings since the mid-1970s. \rPowder coatings are classi\ufb01ed as thermoplastic or thermosetting. Common thermoplastic powders include polyvinylchloride, nylon, polyester, polyethylene, and polypropylene.They are generally applied as relatively thick coatings,0.08\u20130.30 mm (0.003\u20130.012 in). Common thermosetting coating powders are epoxy, polyester, and acrylic. They are applied as uncured resins that polymerize and cross-link on heating or reaction with other ingredients. Coating thicknesses are typically 0.025 to \r0.075 mm (0.001\u20130.003 in). \rThere are two principal application methods for powder coatings: spraying and \ufb02 uidized bed. In the spraying method, an electrostatic charge is given to each particle in order to attract it to an electrically grounded part surface. Several spray gun designs are available to impart the charge to the powders. The spray guns can be operated manually or by industrial robots. Compressed air is used to propel the powders to the nozzle.The powders are dry when sprayed,and any excess particles that do not attach to the surface can be recycled (unless multiple paint colors are mixed in the same spray booth).

In this method, the work part to be coated is preheated and passed through a \ufb02uidized bed, in which powders are suspended (\ufb02uidized) by an airstream. The powders attach themselves to the part surface to form the coating. In some implementations of this coating method, the powders are electrostatically charged to increase attraction to the grounded part surface. \r\r\rPorcelain Enameling and Other Ceramic Coatings \rPorcelain is a ceramic made from kaolin, feldspar, and quartz (Section 7.2.1). It can be applied to substrate metals such as steel, cast iron, and aluminum as a vitreous porcelain enamel. Porcelain coatings are valued for their beauty, color, smoothness, ease of cleaning, chemical inertness, and general durability. Porcelain enameling is the name given to the technology of these ceramic coating materials and the processes by which they are applied. \rPorcelain enameling is used in a wide variety of products, including bathroom \ufb01xtures (e.g., sinks, bathtubs, lavatories), household appliances (e.g., ranges, water heaters, washing machines, dishwashers), kitchen ware, hospital utensils, jet engine components, automotive muf\ufb02ers, and electronic circuit boards. Compositions of the porcelains vary, depending on product requirements. Some porcelains are formulated for color and beauty, while others are designed for functions such as resistance to chemicals and weather, ability to withstand high service temperatures, hardness and abrasion resistance, and electrical resistance. \rAs a process, porcelain enameling consists of (1) preparing the coating material, \r(2) applying to the surface, (3) drying, if needed, and (4) \ufb01ring. Preparation involves converting the glassy porcelain into \ufb01 ne particles, called frit, that are milled to proper and consistent size. The methods for applying the frit are similar to methods used for applying organic coatings, even though the starting material is entirely different. Some application methods involve mixing frit with water as a carrier (the mixture is called a slip), while other methods apply the porcelain as dry powder. The techniques include spraying, electrostatic spraying, \ufb02ow coating, dipping, and electrodeposition. Firing is accomplished at temperatures around 800\u00b0C (1500\u00b0F). Firing is a sintering process (Section 16.1.4) in which the frit is transformed into nonporous vitreous porcelain. Typical coating thickness ranges from 0.075 to 2 mm (0.003\u20130.08 in). The processing sequence may be repeated several times to obtain the desired thickness. \rIn addition to porcelain, other ceramics are used as coatings for special purposes. These coatings usually contain a high content of alumina, which makes them more suited to refractory applications. Techniques for applying the coatings are similar to the preceding, except \ufb01ring temperatures are higher. \r\r Thermal and Mechanical Coating Processes These processes apply discrete coatings that are generally thicker than coatings deposited by other processes considered in this chapter.

The processes include (1) thermal spraying, (2) hard facing, and (3) the \ufb02exible overlay process. \rIn thermal spraying, molten and semimolten coating materials are sprayed onto a substrate, where they solidify and adhere to the surface. A wide variety of coating materials can be applied; the categories are pure metals and metal alloys; ceramics (oxides, carbides, and certain glasses); other metallic compounds (sul\ufb01des, silicides); cermet composites; and certain plastics (epoxy, nylon, Te\ufb02on, and others). The substrates include metals, ceramics, glass, some plastics, wood, and paper. Not all coatings can be applied to all substrates. When the process is used to apply a metallic coating, the terms metallizing or metal spraying are used. \rTechnologies used to heat the coating material are oxyfuel \ufb02ame, electric arc, and plasma arc. The starting coating material is in the form of wire or rod, or powders. When wire (or rod) is used, the heating source melts the leading end of the wire, thereby separating it from the solid stock. The molten material is then atomized by a high-velocity gas stream (compressed air or other source), and the droplets are spattered against the work surface. When powder stock is used, a powder feeder dispenses the \ufb01ne particles into a gas stream, which transports them into the \ufb02ame, where they are melted. The expanding gases in the \ufb02ame propel the molten (or semimolten) powders against the workpiece. Coating thickness in thermal spraying is generally greater than in other deposition processes; the typical range is 0.05 to \r2.5 mm (0.002\u20130.100 in). \rThe \ufb01rst applications of thermal spray coating were to rebuild worn areas on used machinery components and to salvage work parts that had been machined undersize. Success of the technique has led to its use in manufacturing as a coating process for corrosion resistance, high temperature protection, wear resistance, electrical conductivity,electrical resistance,electromagnetic interference shielding,and other functions. \rHard facing is a surfacing technique in which alloys are applied as welded deposits to substrate metals. What distinguishes hard facing is that fusion occurs between the coating and the substrate, as in fusion welding (Section 28.1.1), whereas the bond in thermal spraying is typically mechanical interlocking that does not stand up as well to abrasive wear. Thus, hard facing is especially suited to components requiring good wear resistance. Applications include coating new parts and repairing used part surfaces that are heavily worn, eroded, or corroded. An advantage of hard facing that should be mentioned is that it is readily accomplished outside of the relatively controlled factory environment by many of the common welding processes, such as oxyacetylene gas welding and arc welding. Some of the common surfacing materials include steel and iron alloys, cobalt-based alloys, and nickel-based alloys. Coating thickness is usually 0.75 to 2.5 mm (0.030\u20130.125 in), although thicknesses as great as 9 mm (3/8 in) are possible. \rThe \ufb02 exible overlay process is capable of depositing a very hard coating material, such as tungsten carbide (WC), onto a substrate surface. This is an important advantage of the process compared to other methods, permitting coating hardness up to about 70 Rockwell C. The process can also be used to apply coatings only to selected regions of a work part. In the \ufb02 exible overlay process, a cloth impregnated with hard ceramic or metal powders and another cloth impregnated with brazing alloy are laid onto a substrate and heated to fuse the powders to the surface.

Applications include chain saw teeth, rock drill bits, oil drill collars, extrusion dies, and similar parts requiring good wear resistance. \r27.8.2 MECHANICAL PLATING \rIn this coating process, mechanical energy is used to build a metallic coating onto the surface. In mechanical plating, the parts to be coated, together with plating metal powders, glass beads, and special chemicals to promote the plating action, are tumbled in a barrel. The metallic powders are microscopic in size\u20145 mm (0.0002 in) in diameter; while the glass beads are much larger\u20142.5 mm (0.10 in) in diameter. As the mixture is tumbled, the mechanical energy from the rotating barrel is transmitted through the glass beads to pound the metal powders against the part surface, causing a mechanical or metallurgical bond to result.The deposited metals must be malleable in order to achieve a satisfactory bond with the substrate. Plating metals include zinc, cadmium, tin, and lead. The term mechanical galvanizing is used for parts that are zinc coated. Ferrous metals are most commonly coated; other metals include brass and bronze.Typical applications include fasteners such as screws,bolts,nuts,and nails. Plating thickness in mechanical plating is usually 0.005 to 0.025 mm (0.0002\u20130.001 in). Zinc is mechanically plated to a thickness of around 0.075 mm (0.003 in). \r\r[1] ASM Handbook, Vol. 5, Surface Engineering, ASM International, Materials Park, Ohio, 1993. \r[2] Budinski, K. G.

The term joining is generally used for welding, brazing, soldering, and adhesive bonding, which form a permanent joint between the parts\u2014a joint that cannot easily be separated.The term assembly usually refers to mechanical methods of fastening parts together. Mechanical assembly is covered in Chapter 31. Some of these methods allow for easy disassembly, while others do not. Brazing, soldering, and adhesive bonding are discussed in Chapter 30. Coverage of the joining and assembly processes begins with welding, addressed in this chapter and the following. \rWelding is a materials joining process in which two or more parts are coalesced at their contacting surfaces by a suitable application of heat and/or pressure. Many welding processes are accomplished by heat alone, with no pressure applied; others by a combination of heat and pressure; and still others by pressure alone, with no external heat supplied. In some welding processes a \ufb01ller material is added to facilitate coalescence.The assemblage of parts that are joined by welding is called a weldment. Welding is most commonly associated with metal parts, but the process is also used for joining plastics. Here, the discussion will focus on metals. \rWelding is a relatively new process (Historical Note 28.1). Its commercial and technological importance derives from the following: \r\u27a2 \rWelding provides a permanent joint. The welded parts become a single entity. \r\r\u27a2 \rThe welded joint can be stronger than the parent materials if a \ufb01ller metal is used that has strength properties superior to those of the parents, and if proper welding techniques are used. \r\r\u27a2 \rWelding is usually the most economical way to join components in terms of material usage and fabrication costs. Alternative mechanical methods of assembly require more complex shape alterations (e.g., drilling of holes) and addition of fasteners (e.g., rivets or bolts). The resulting mechanical assembly is usually heavier than a corresponding weldment. \r\r\u27a2 \rWelding is not restricted to the factory environment. It can be accomplished \u201cin the \ufb01eld.\u201d \r\rAlthough welding has the advantages indicated above, it also has certain limitations and drawbacks (or potential drawbacks): \r\r\u27a2 \rMost welding operations are performed manually and are expensive in terms of labor cost. Many welding operations are considered \u201cskilled trades,\u201d and the labor to perform these operations may be scarce. \r\r\u27a2 \rMost welding processes are inherently dangerous because they involve the use of high energy. \r\r\u27a2 \rBecause welding accomplishes a permanent bond between the components, it does not allow for convenient disassembly. If the product must occasionally be disassembled (e.g., for repair or maintenance), then welding should not be used as the assembly method. \r\r\u27a2 \rThe welded joint can suffer from certain quality defects that are dif\ufb01cult to detect. The defects can reduce the strength of the joint. \r\r\r\r\rHistorical Note 28.1 Origins of welding \rAlthough welding is considered a relatively new process as practiced today, its origins can be traced to ancient times. Around 1000 BCE, the Egyptians and others in the eastern Mediterranean area learned to accomplish forge welding (Section 29.5.2). It was a natural extension of hot forging, which they used to make weapons, tools, and other implements. Forge-welded articles of bronze have been recovered by archeologists from the pyramids of Egypt. From these early beginnings through the Middle Ages, the blacksmith trade developed the art of welding by hammering to a high level of maturity.

From these early beginnings through the Middle Ages, the blacksmith trade developed the art of welding by hammering to a high level of maturity. Welded objects of iron and other metals dating from these times have been found in India and Europe. \rIt was not until the 1800s that the technological foundations of modern welding were established. Two important discoveries were made, both attributed to English scientist Sir Humphrey Davy: (1) the electric arc, and (2) acetylene gas. \rAround 1801, Davy observed that an electric arc could be struck between two carbon electrodes. However, not until the mid-1800s, when the electric generator was invented, did electrical power become available in amounts suf\ufb01 cient to sustain arc welding. It was a Russian, Nikolai Benardos, working out of a laboratory in France, who was granted a series of patents for the carbon arc\u2013welding process (one in England in 1885, and another in the United States in 1887). By the turn of the century, carbon arc welding had become a popular commercial process for joining metals. \rBenardos\u2019 inventions seem to have been limited to carbon arc welding. In 1892, an American named Charles Cof\ufb01n was awarded a U.S. patent for developing an arc\u2013welding process utilizing a metal electrode. The unique feature was that the electrode added \ufb01 ller metal to the weld joint (the carbon arc process does not deposit \ufb01ller). The idea of coating the metal electrode (to shield the welding process from the atmosphere) was developed later, with enhancements to the metal arc\u2013welding process being made in England and Sweden starting around 1900. \rBetween 1885 and 1900, several forms of resistance welding were developed by Elihu Thompson. These included spot welding and seam welding, two joining methods widely used today in sheet metalworking. \rAlthough Davy discovered acetylene gas early in the 1800s, oxyfuel gas welding required the subsequent development of torches for combining acetylene and oxygen around 1900. During the 1890s, hydrogen and natural gas were mixed with oxygen for welding, but the oxyacetylene \ufb02ame achieved signi\ufb01 cantly higher temperatures. \rThese three welding processes\u2014arc welding, resistance welding, and oxyfuel gas welding\u2014 constitute by far the majority of welding operations performed today. \r\r Overview of Welding Technology Welding involves localized coalescence or joining together of two metallic parts at their faying surfaces. The faying surfaces are the part surfaces in contact or close proximity that are to be joined. Welding is usually performed on parts made of the same metal, but some welding operations can be used to join dissimilar metals.  \r28.1.1  TYPES OF WELDING PROCESSES  \r\r\rSome 50 different types of welding operations have been cataloged by the American Welding Society. They use various types or combinations of energy to provide the required power.The welding processes can be divided into two major groups:(1) fusion welding and (2) solid-state welding. \rFusion Welding Fusion-welding processes use heat to melt the base metals. In many fusion welding operations, a \ufb01ller metal is added to the molten pool to facilitate the process and provide bulk and strength to the welded joint.A fusion-welding operation in which no \ufb01ller metal is added is referred to as an autogenous weld. The fusion category includes the most widely used welding processes, which can be organized into the following general groups (initials in parentheses are designations of the American Welding Society): \r\u27a2 Arc welding (AW).

There are many variations of thearc-welding process. \r\r\u27a2 \rResistance welding (RW). Resistance welding achieves coalescence using heat from electrical resistance to the \ufb02ow of a current passing between the faying surfaces of two parts held together under pressure. \r\r\u27a2 \rOxyfuel gas welding (OFW).These joining processes use an oxyfuel gas,such as a mixture of oxygen and acetylene, to produce a hot \ufb02ame for melting the base metal and \ufb01ller metal, if one is used. \r\r\u27a2 \rOther fusion-welding processes. Other welding processes that produce fusion of the metals joined include electron beam welding and laser beam welding. \r\r\rCertain arc and oxyfuel processes are also used for cutting metals (Sections 25.3.4 and 25.3.5). \rSolid-State Welding Solid-state welding refers to joining processes in which coalescence results from application of pressure alone or a combination of heat and pressure. If heat is used, the temperature in the process is below the melting point of the metals being welded. No \ufb01 ller metal is utilized. Representative welding processes in this group include: \r\u27a2 \rDiffusion welding (DFW). Two surfaces are held together under pressure at an elevated temperature and the parts coalesce by solid-state diffusion. \r\r\u27a2 \rFriction welding (FRW). Coalescence is achieved by the heat of friction between two surfaces. \r\r\u27a2 \rUltrasonic welding (USW). Moderate pressure is applied between the two parts and an oscillating motion at ultrasonic frequencies is used in a direction parallel to the contacting surfaces. The combination of normal and vibratory forces results in shear stresses that remove surface \ufb01lms and achieve atomic bonding of the surfaces. \r\r\rThe various welding processes are described in greater detail in Chapter 29. The \rpreceding survey should provide a suf\ufb01cient framework for the discussion of weld\ring terminology and principles in the present chapter. \r28.1.2 WELDING AS A COMMERCIAL OPERATION \rThe principal applications of welding are (1) construction, such as buildings and bridges; (2) piping, pressure vessels, boilers, and storage tanks; (3) shipbuilding; (4) aircraft and aerospace;and (5) automotive and railroad [1].Welding is performed in a variety of locations and in a variety of industries. Owing to its versatility as an assembly technique for commercial products, many welding operations are performed in factories. However, several of the traditional processes, such as arc welding and oxyfuel gas welding, use equipment that can be readily moved, so these operations are not limited to the factory. They can be performed at construction sites, in shipyards, at customers\u2019 plants, and in automotive repair shops. \rMost welding operations are labor intensive. For example, arc welding is usually performed by a skilled worker, called a welder, who manually controls the path or placement of the weld to join individual parts into a larger unit. In factory operations in which arc welding is manually performed, the welder often works with a second worker, called a \ufb01 tter. It is the \ufb01tter\u2019s job to arrange the individual components for the welder prior to making the weld.Welding \ufb01xtures and positioners are used for this purpose.

It is the \ufb01tter\u2019s job to arrange the individual components for the welder prior to making the weld.Welding \ufb01xtures and positioners are used for this purpose. A welding \ufb01 xture is a device for clamping and holding the components in \ufb01xed position for welding. It is custom-fabricated for the particular geometry of the weldment and therefore must be economically justi\ufb01ed on the basis of the quantities of assemblies to be produced. A welding positioner is a device that holds the parts and also moves the assemblage to the desired position for welding. This differs from a welding \ufb01xture that only holds the parts in a single \ufb01xed position. The desired position is usually one in which the weld path is \ufb02 at and horizontal. \rThe Safety Issue Welding is inherently dangerous to human workers. Strict safety precautions must be practiced by those who perform these operations.The high temperatures of the molten metals in welding are an obvious danger. In gas welding, the fuels (e.g., acetylene) are a \ufb01re hazard. Most of the processes use high energy to cause melting of the part surfaces to be joined. In many welding processes, electrical power is the source of thermal energy, so there is the hazard of electrical shock to the worker. Certain welding processes have their own particular perils. In arc welding, for example, ultraviolet radiation is emitted that is injurious to human vision. A special helmet that includes a dark viewing window must be worn by the welder. This window \ufb01lters out the dangerous radiation but is so dark that it renders the welder virtually blind, except when the arc is struck. Sparks, spatters of molten metal, smoke,and fumes add to the risks associated with welding operations.Ventilation facilities must be used to exhaust the dangerous fumes generated by some of the \ufb02 uxes and molten metals used in welding. If the operation is performed in an enclosed area, special ventilation suits or hoods are required. \rAutomation in Welding Because of the hazards of manual welding, and in efforts to increase productivity and improve product quality, various forms of mechanization and automation have been developed.The categories include machine welding, automatic welding, and robotic welding. \rMachine welding can be de\ufb01ned as mechanized welding with equipment that performs the operation under the continuous supervision of an operator. It is normally accomplished by a welding head that is moved by mechanical means relative to a stationary work, or by moving the work relative to a stationary welding head. The human worker must continually observe and interact with the equipment to control the operation. \rIf the equipment is capable of performing the operation without control by a human operator, it is referred to as automatic welding. A human worker is usually present to oversee the process and detect variations from normal conditions. What distinguishes automatic welding from machine welding is a weld cycle controller to regulate the arc movement and workpiece positioning without continuous human attention.Automatic welding requires a welding \ufb01xture and/or positioner to position the work relative to the welding head. It also requires a higher degree of consistency and accuracy in the component parts used in the weldment.

This section covers two classi\ufb01cations related to weld joints: (1) types of joints and (2) the types of welds used to join the pieces that form the joints. \r28.2.1 TYPES OF JOINTS \rThere are \ufb01ve basic types of joints for bringing two parts together for joining. The \ufb01ve joint types are not limited to welding; they apply to other joining and fastening techniques as well. With reference to Figure 28.2, the \ufb01ve joint types can be de\ufb01ned as follows: \r(a) \rButt joint. In this joint type, the parts lie in the same plane and are joined at their edges. \r\r(b) \rCorner joint. The parts in a corner joint form a right angle and are joined at the corner of the angle. \r\r(c) \rLap joint. This joint consists of two overlapping parts. \r\r(d) \rTee joint. In a tee joint, one part is perpendicular to the other in the approximate shape of the letter \u201cT.\u201d \r\r(e) \rEdge joint.The parts in an edge joint are parallel with at least one of their edges in common, and the joint is made at the common edge(s). \r\r\r\r28.2.2 TYPES OF WELDS \rEach of the preceding joints can be made by welding. It is appropriate to distinguish between the joint type and the way in which it is welded\u2014the weld type. Differences among weld types are in geometry (joint type) and welding process. \r\r\r(a) square groove weld, one side; (b) single bevel groove weld; (c) single V-groove weld; (d) single U-groove weld; (e) single J-groove weld; (f) double V-groove weld for thicker sections.

It is the most common weld type in arc and oxyfuel welding because it requires minimum edge preparation\u2014the basic square edges of the parts are used. Fillet welds can be single or double (i.e., welded on one side or both) and can be continuous or intermittent (i.e., welded along the entire length of the joint or with unwelded spaces along the length). \rGroove welds usually require that the edges of the parts be shaped into a groove to facilitate weld penetration.

If a \ufb01ller metal is added, the heat density must be high enough to melt it also. Heat density can be de\ufb01ned as the power transferred to the work per unit surface area, W/mm2 (Btu/sec-in2). The time to melt the metal is inversely proportional to the power density. At low power densities, a signi\ufb01cant amount of time is required to cause melting. If power density is too low, the heat is conducted into the work as rapidly as it is added at the surface, and melting never occurs. It has been found that the minimum power density required to melt most metals in welding is about 10 W/mm2 (6 Btu/sec-in2). As heat density increases, melting time is reduced. If power density is too high\u2014above around 105 W/mm2 (60,000 Btu/sec-in2)\u2014the localized temperatures vaporize the metal in the affected region. Thus, there is a practical range of values for power density within which welding can be performed. Differences among welding processes in this range are (1) the rate at which welding can be performed and/or (2) the size of the region that can be welded. Table 28.1 provides a comparison of power densities for the major fusion welding processes. Oxyfuel gas welding is capable of developing large amounts of heat, but the heat density is relatively low because it is spread over a large area. Oxyacetylene gas, the hottest of the OFW fuels, burns at a top temperature of around 3500\u00b0C (6300\u00b0F). By comparison, arc welding produces high energy over a smaller area, resulting in local temperatures of 5500\u00b0C to 600\u00b0C (10,000\u00b0F\u201312,000\u00b0F).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 17309, "end_char_idx": 21296, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "47c6ee1d-ff6f-4b60-81ea-f93b50876a54": {"__data__": {"id_": "47c6ee1d-ff6f-4b60-81ea-f93b50876a54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec28.txt", "file_name": "sec28.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34934, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d8273b37-e2b3-44e4-9ff9-b666cd922ff5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec28.txt", "file_name": "sec28.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34934, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "51ca580a885e98ff3fc3d441d109d95f94ae522035aa71a8e716b5e3af6eb8a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "139e3b47-eac9-4b15-8af2-549ed2105fac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec28.txt", "file_name": "sec28.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 34934, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "ffce5a68b8f5e762ea1149be568dfafbdb25b0ee20dc870ef172056f11d5d29e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a812b33c-066e-459c-8649-359c5eafc0cc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3510975def133ceb7d07c32ef103991a124cf569a7d84dd3486b43b598a0a534", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Thus, there is a practical range of values for power density within which welding can be performed.

For metallurgical reasons, it is desirable to melt the metal with minimum energy, and high power densities are generally preferable. \rPower density can be computed as the power entering the surface divided by the corresponding surface area: \rPD ! AP (28.1) \rwhere PD  power density, W/mm2 (Btu/sec-in2); P  power entering the surface, W (Btu/sec); and A  surface area over which the energy is entering, mm2 (in2).The issue is more complicated than indicated by Equation (28.1). One complication is that the power source (e.g., the arc) is moving in many welding processes, which results in preheating ahead of the operation and postheating behind it. Another complication is that power density is not uniform throughout the affected surface; it is distributed as a function of area, as demonstrated by the following example. \rTABLE \u2022 28.1 Comparison of several fusion welding processeson the basis of their power densities. \r\r\rA heat source transfers 3000 W to the surface of a metal part. The heat impinges the surface in a circular area, with intensities varying inside the circle. The distribution is as follows: 70% of the power is transferred within a circle of diameter  5 mm, and 90% is transferred within a concentric circle of diameter  12 mm. What are the power densities in (a) the 5-mm-diameter inner circle and (b) the 12-mm-diameter ring that lies around the inner circle? \rp(5)2 \rSolution: (a) The inner circle has an area A ! 19.63 mm2 \r4 The power inside this area P  0.70  3000  2100 W \rThus the power density PD ! 2100 ! 107 W/mm2 \r19.63 \rp(122  52)\r(b) The area of the ring outside the inner circle is A  93.4 mm2 \r4 The power in this region P  0.9 (3000)  2100  600 W. \rThe power density is therefore PD 600 ! 6.4 W/mm2 \r93.4 Observation: The power density seems high enough for melting in the inner circle, but probably not suf\ufb01cient in the ring that lies outside this inner circle. \r\r28.3.2 HEAT BALANCE IN FUSION WELDING \rThe quantity of heat required to melt a given volume of metal depends on (1) the heat to raise the temperature of the solid metal to its melting point, which depends on the metal\u2019s volumetric speci\ufb01c heat, (2) the melting point of the metal, and (3) the heat to transform the metal from solid to liquid phase at the melting point, which depends on the metal\u2019s heat of fusion.

Absolute melting temperatures for selected metals are presented in Table 28.2. \rNot all of the energy generated at the heat source is used to melt the weld metal. There are two heat transfer mechanisms at work, both of which reduce the amount of generated heat that is used by the welding process. The situation is depicted in Figure 28.8. The \ufb01rst mechanism involves the transfer of heat between the heat source and the surface of the work.This process has a certain heat transfer factor f1, de\ufb01ned as the ratio of the actual heat received by the workpiece divided by the total heat generated at the source. The second mechanism involves the conduction of heat away from the weld area to be dissipated throughout the work metal, so that only a portion of the heat transferred to the surface is available for melting.This melting factor f2 is the proportion ofheat received at the work surface thatcan be used for melting.The combined effect of these two factors is to reduce the heat energy available for welding as follows: \rHw ! f1f2H (28.3) \r\rHeat source for welding \rTABLE \u2022 28.2 Melting temperatures on the absolute temperature scale forselected metals. \r\rBased on values in [2]. a Kelvin scale = Centigrade (Celsius) temperature  273. b Rankine scale = Fahrenheit temperature  460. \rwhere Hw  net heat available for welding, J (Btu), f1  heat transfer factor, f2  the melting factor, and H  the total heat generated by the welding process, J (Btu). \rThe factors f1 and f2 range in value between zero and one. It is appropriate to separate f1 and f2 in concept, even though they act in concert during the welding process. The heat transfer factor f1 is determined largely by the welding process and the capacity to convert the power source (e.g., electrical energy) into usable heat at the work surface. Arc-welding processes are relatively ef\ufb01cient in this regard, while oxyfuel gas-welding processes are relatively inef\ufb01cient. \rThe melting factor f2 depends on the welding process, but it is also in\ufb02uenced by the thermal properties of the metal, joint con\ufb01guration, and work thickness.

The problem is exacerbated by welding heat sources with low energy \r\r(1-f1) Heat losses f1 Heat transferred to work surface \r\r\rdensities (e.g., oxyfuel welding) because the heat input is spread over a larger area, thus facilitating conduction into the work.

UmV (28.4) \rwhere Hw ! net heat energy used by the welding operation, J (Btu); Um ! unit energy required to melt the metal, J/mm3 (Btu/in3); and V ! the volume of metal melted, mm3 (in3). \rMost welding operations are rate processes; that is, the net heat energy Hw is delivered at a given rate, and the weld bead is made at a certain travel velocity. This is characteristic for example of most arc welding, many oxyfuel gas-welding operations, and even some resistance welding operations. It is therefore appropriate to express Equation (28.4) as a rate balance equation: \rRHw ! UmRWV (28.5) \rwhere RHw ! rate of heat energy delivered to the operation for welding, J/s !

As illustrated in the cross-sectional view of Figure 28.9(a), a typical fusion-weld joint in which \ufb01ller metal has been added consists of several zones: (1) fusion zone, (2) weld interface, (3) heat-affected zone, and \r(4) unaffected base metal zone. \rThe fusion zone consists of a mixture of \ufb01ller metal and base metal that have completely melted. This zone is characterized by a high degree of homogeneity among the component metals that have been melted during welding. The mixing of these components is motivated largely by convection in the molten weld pool. Solidi\ufb01 cation in the fusion zone has similarities to a casting process. In welding the mold is formed by the unmelted edges or surfaces of the components being welded. The signi\ufb01 cant difference between solidi\ufb01 cation in casting and in welding is that epitaxial grain growth occurs in welding. The reader may recall that in casting, the metallic grains are formed from the melt by nucleation of solid particles at the mold wall, followed by grain growth. In welding, by contrast, the nucleation stage of solidi\ufb01 cation is avoided by the mechanism of epitaxial grain growth, in which atoms from the molten pool solidify on preexisting lattice sites of the adjacent solid base metal. Consequently, the grain structure in the fusion zone near the heat affected zone tends to mimic the crystallographic orientation of the surrounding heat-affected zone.

The resulting structure in the solidi\ufb01ed fusion zone tends to feature coarse columnar grains, as depicted in Figure 28.9(b). The grain structure depends on various factors, including welding process, metals being welded (e.g., identical metals vs. dissimilar metals welded), whether a \ufb01ller metal is used, and the feed rate at which welding is accomplished. A detailed discussion of welding metallurgy is beyond the scope of this text, and interested readers can consult any of several references [1], [4], [5]. \rThe second zone in the weld joint is the weld interface, a narrow boundary that separates the fusion zone from the heat-affected zone.The interface consists of a thin band of base metal that was melted or partially melted (localized melting within the grains) during the welding process but then immediately solidi\ufb01 ed before any mixing with the metal in the fusion zone. Its chemical composition is therefore identical to that of the base metal. \rThe third zone in the typical fusion weld is the heat-affected zone (HAZ). The metal in this zone has experienced temperatures that are below its melting point, yet high enough to cause microstructural changes in the solid metal. The chemical composition in the heat-affected zone is the same as the base metal, but this region has been heat treated due to the welding temperatures so that its properties and structure have been altered. The amount of metallurgical damage in the HAZ depends on factors such as the amount of heat input and peak temperatures reached, distance from the fusion zone, length of time the metal has been subjected to the high temperatures,cooling rate,and the metal\u2019s thermal properties.The effect on mechanical properties in the heat-affected zone is usually negative, and it is in this region of the weld joint that welding failures often occur. \r\rAs the distance from the fusion zone increases, the unaffected base metal zone is \ufb01nally reached, in which no metallurgical change has occurred. Nevertheless, the base metal surrounding the HAZ is likely to be in a state of high residual stress, the result of shrinkage in the fusion zone. \r\r[1]  ASM Handbook,Vol. 6, Welding, Brazing, and Soldering.

It includes (1) arc welding, (2) resistance welding, \r(3) oxyfuel gas welding, and (4) other fusion welding processes\u2014ones that cannot be classi\ufb01ed as any of the \ufb01rst three types. Fusion welding processes are discussed in the \ufb01rst four sections of this chapter. Section 29.5 covers solid-state welding. And in the \ufb01nal three sections of the chapter, issues common to all welding operations are examined: weld quality, weldability, and design for welding. \r\r\r29.1 Arc Welding \rArc welding (AW) is a fusion-welding process in which coalescence of the metals is achieved by the heat of an electric arc between an electrode and the work. The same basic process is also used in arc cutting (Section 25.3.4). A generic AW process is shown in Figure 29.1. An electric arc is a discharge of electric current across a gap in a circuit. It is sustained by the presence of a thermally ionized column of gas (called a plasma) through which current \ufb02ows. To initiate the arc in an AW process, the electrode is brought into contact with the work and then quickly separated from it by a short distance. The electric energy from the arc thus formed produces temperatures of 5500\u00b0C (10,000\u00b0F) or higher, suf\ufb01 ciently hot to melt any metal. A pool of molten metal, consisting of base metal(s) and \ufb01ller metal (if one is used) is formed near the tip of the electrode. In most arc-welding processes, \ufb01ller metal is added during the operation to increase the volume and strength of the weld joint. As the electrode is moved along the joint, the molten weld pool solidi\ufb01es in its wake. \r\r\rMovement of the electrode relative to the work is accomplished by either a human welder (manual welding) or by mechanical means (i.e., machine welding, automatic welding, or robotic welding). One of the troublesome aspects of manual arc welding is that the quality of the weld joint depends on the skill and work ethic of the human welder. Productivity is also an issue. It is often measured as arc time (also called arc-on time)\u2014the proportion of hours worked that arc welding is being accomplished: \rArc time  (time arc is on)(hours worked) (29.1) \r\rThis de\ufb01nition can be applied to an individual welder or to a mechanized workstation.

Arc time increases to about 50% (more or less, depending on the operation) for machine, automatic, and robotic welding. \r29.1.1 GENERAL TECHNOLOGY OF ARC WELDING \rBefore describing the individual AW processes, it is instructional to examine some of the general technical issues that apply to these processes. \rElectrodes Electrodes used in AW processes are classi\ufb01ed as consumable or non-consumable. Consumable electrodes provide the source of the \ufb01ller metal in arc welding. These electrodes are available in two principal forms: rods (also called sticks) and wire. The problem with consumable welding rods, at least in production welding operations, is that they must be changed periodically, reducing arc time of the welder. Consumable weld wire has the advantage that it can be continuously fed into the weld pool from spools containing long lengths of wire, thus avoiding the frequent interruptions that occur when using welding sticks. In both rod and wire forms, the electrode is consumed by the arc during the welding process and added to the weld joint as \ufb01ller metal. \rNonconsumable electrodes are made of tungsten (or carbon, rarely), which resists melting by the arc. Despite its name, a nonconsumable electrode is gradually depleted during the welding process (vaporization is the principal mechanism), analogous to the gradual wearing of a cutting tool in a machining operation. For AW processes that utilize nonconsumable electrodes, any \ufb01ller metal used in the operation must be supplied by means of a separate wire that is fed into the weld pool. \rArc Shielding At the high temperatures in arc welding, the metals being joined are chemically reactive to oxygen,nitrogen,and hydrogen in the air.The mechanical properties of the weld joint can be seriously degraded by these reactions.Thus,some means to shield the arc from the surrounding air is provided in nearly all AW processes. Arc shielding is accomplished by covering the electrode tip, arc, and molten weld pool with a blanket of gas or \ufb02ux, or both, which inhibit exposure of the weld metal to air. \rCommon shielding gases include argon and helium, both of which are inert. In the welding of ferrous metals with certain AW processes, oxygen and carbon dioxide are used, usually in combination with Ar and/or He, to produce an oxidizing atmosphere or to control weld shape. \rA \ufb02 ux is a substance used to prevent the formation of oxides and other unwanted contaminants, or to dissolve them and facilitate removal. During welding, the \ufb02ux melts and becomes a liquid slag, covering the operation and protecting the molten weld metal.The slag hardens upon cooling and must be removed later by chipping or brushing. Flux is usually formulated to serve several additional functions: (1) provide a protective atmosphere for welding, (2) stabilize the arc, and (3) reduce spattering. \rThe method of \ufb02ux application differs for each process. The delivery techniques include (1) pouring granular \ufb02ux onto the welding operation, (2) using a stick electrode coated with \ufb02ux material in which the coating melts during welding to cover the operation, and (3) using tubular electrodes in which \ufb02ux is contained in the core and released as the electrode is consumed.These techniques are discussed further in the descriptions of the individual AW processes. \rPower Source in Arc Welding Both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) are used in arc welding.AC machines are less expensive to purchase and operate, but are generally restricted to welding of ferrous metals. DC equipment can be used on all metals with good results and is generally noted for better arc control. \rIn all arc welding processes, power to drive the operation is the product of the current I passing through the arc and the voltage E across it. This power is converted into heat, but not all of the heat is transferred to the surface of the work. Convection, conduction, radiation, and spatter account for losses that reduce the amount of usable heat. The effect of the losses is expressed by the heat transfer factor f1 (Section 28.3.2).

The process is illustrated in Figures 29.2 and 29.3. The welding stick (SMAW is sometimes called stick welding) is typically 225 to 450 mm (9\u201318 in) long and 2.5 to 9.5 mm (3/32\u20133/8 in) in diameter. The \ufb01ller metal used in the rod must be compatible with the metal to be welded, the composition usually being very close to that of the base metal. The coating consists of powdered cellulose (i.e., cotton and wood powders) mixed with oxides, carbonates, and other ingredients, held together by a silicate binder. Metal powders are also sometimes included in the coating to increase the amount of \ufb01ller metal and to add alloying elements. The heat of the welding process melts the coating to provide a protective atmosphere and slag for the welding operation.

(Photo courtesy ofHobart Brothers Company.) \rDuring operation the bare metal end of the welding stick (opposite the welding tip) is clamped in an electrode holder that is connected to the power source.The holder has an insulated handle so that it can be held and manipulated by a human welder. Currents typically used in SMAW range between 30 and 300 A at voltages from 15 to 45 V. Selection of the proper power parameters depends on the metals being welded, electrode type and length, and depth of weld penetration required. Power supply, connecting cables, and electrode holder can be bought for a few thousand dollars. \rShielded metal arc welding is usually performed manually. Common applications include construction, pipelines, machinery structures, shipbuilding, job shop fabrication, and repair work. It is preferred over oxyfuel welding for thicker sections\u2014 above 5 mm (3/16 in)\u2014because of its higher power density. The equipment is portable and low cost, making SMAW highly versatile and probably the most widely used of the AW processes. Base metals include steels, stainless steels, cast irons, and certain nonferrous alloys. It is not used or seldom used for aluminum and its alloys, copper alloys, and titanium. \rA disadvantage of shielded metal arc welding as a production operation is the use of the consumable electrode stick. As the sticks are used up, they must periodically \rConsumable electrode \rFIGURE 29.3 Shielded metal arc welding(SMAW). \r\r\r\r\rElectrode wire \rShielding gas Solidified weld metal \r\rFIGURE 29.4 \rGas metal arc welding (GMAW). \r\r\rbe changed. This reduces the arc time with this welding process. Another limitation is the current level that can be used. Because the electrode length varies during the operation and this length affects the resistance heating of the electrode, current levels must be maintained within a safe range or the coating will overheat and melt prematurely when starting a new welding stick. Some of the other AW processes overcome the limitations of welding stick length in SMAW by using a continuously fed wire electrode. \rGas Metal Arc Welding Gas metal arc welding (GMAW) is an AW process in which the electrode is a consumable bare metal wire, and shielding is accomplished by \ufb02ooding the arc with a gas. The bare wire is fed continuously and automatically from a spool through the welding gun, as illustrated in Figure 29.4. A welding gun is shown in Figure 29.5. Wire diameters ranging from 0.8 to 6.5 mm (1/32\u20131/4 in) are used in GMAW, the size depending on the thickness of the parts being joined and the desired deposition rate. Gases used for shielding include inert gases such as argon and helium, and active gases such as carbon dioxide. Selection of gases (and mixtures of gases) depends on the metal being welded, as well as other factors.

The combination of bare electrode wire and shielding gases eliminates the slag covering on the weld bead and thus precludes the need for manual grinding and cleaning of the slag. The GMAW process is therefore ideal for making multiple welding passes on the same joint. \rThe various metals on which GMAW is used and the variations of the process itself have given rise to a variety of names for gas metal arc welding.When the process was \ufb01rst introduced in the late 1940s, it was applied to the welding of aluminum using inert gas (argon) for arc shielding.The name applied to this process was MIG welding (for metal inert gas welding). When the same welding process was applied to steel, it was found that inert gases were expensive and CO2 was used as a substitute. Hence the term CO2 welding was applied. Re\ufb01nements in GMAW for steel welding have led to the use of gas mixtures, including CO2 and argon, and even oxygen and argon. \rGMAW is widely used in fabrication operations in factories for welding a variety of ferrous and nonferrous metals. Because it uses continuous weld wire rather than welding sticks, it has a signi\ufb01cant advantage over SMAW in terms of arc time when performed manually. For the same reason, it also lends itself to automation of arc welding. The electrode stubs remaining after stick welding also wastes \ufb01ller metal, so the utilization of electrode material is higher with GMAW. Other features of GMAW include elimination of slag removal (because no \ufb02ux is used), higher deposition rates than SMAW, and good versatility. \r\rFlux-Cored Arc Welding This arc-welding process was developed in the early 1950s as an adaptation of shielded metal arc welding to overcome the limitations imposed by the use of stick electrodes. Flux-cored arc welding (FCAW) is an arc-welding process in which the electrode is a continuous consumable tubing that contains \ufb02ux and other ingredients in its core. Other ingredients may include deoxidizers and alloying elements.The tubular \ufb02ux-cored \u201cwire\u201dis \ufb02exible and can therefore be supplied in the form of coils to be continuously fed through the arc-welding gun. There are two versions of FCAW: (1) self-shielded and (2) gas shielded. In the \ufb01rst version of FCAW to be developed, arc shielding was provided by a \ufb02ux core, thus leading to the name self-shielded \ufb02 ux-cored arc welding. The core in this form of FCAW includes not only \ufb02uxes but also ingredients that generate shielding gases for protecting the arc. The second version of FCAW, developed primarily for welding steels, obtains arc shielding from externally supplied gases, similar to gas metal arc welding. This version is called gas-shielded \ufb02ux-cored arc welding. Because it utilizes an electrode containing its own \ufb02ux together with separate shielding gases, it might be considered a hybrid of SMAW and GMAW.

Figure 29.6 illustrates the FCAW process, with the gas (optional) distinguishing between the two types. \rFCAW has advantages similar to GMAW, due to continuous feeding of the electrode. It is used primarily for welding steels and stainless steels over a wide stock thickness range. It is noted for its capability to produce very-high-quality weld joints that are smooth and uniform. \rElectrogas Welding Electrogas welding (EGW) is an AW process that uses a continuous consumable electrode (either \ufb02ux-cored wire or bare wire with externally supplied shielding gases) and molding shoes to contain the molten metal. The process is primarily applied to vertical butt welding,as pictured in Figure 29.7.When the \ufb02ux-cored electrode wire is employed, no external gases are supplied, and the process can be considered a special application of self-shielded FCAW.When a bare electrode wire is used with shielding gases from an external source, it is considered a special case of GMAW.The molding shoes are water cooled to prevent their being added to the weld pool.Together with the edges of the parts being welded,the shoes form a container, almost like a mold cavity, into which the molten metal from the electrode and base parts is gradually added.The process is performed automatically, with a moving weld head travelling vertically upward to \ufb01ll the cavity in a single pass. \rPrincipal applications of electrogas welding are steels (low-and medium-carbon, low-alloy, and certain stainless steels) in the construction of large storage tanks and \r\rFIGURE 29.7 \rElectrogas weldingusing \ufb02ux-cored electrode wire: (a) frontview with molding shoeremoved for clarity, and \r(b) side view showingmolding shoes on bothsides. \r\rin shipbuilding. Stock thicknesses from 12 to 75 mm (0.5\u20133.0 in) are within the capacity of EGW. In addition to butt welding, it can also be used for \ufb01llet and groove welds, always in a vertical orientation. Specially designed molding shoes must sometimes be fabricated for the joint shapes involved. \rSubmerged Arc Welding This process, developed during the 1930s, was one of the \ufb01rst AW processes to be automated. Submerged arc welding (SAW) is an arc-welding process that uses a continuous, consumable bare wire electrode, and arc shielding is provided by a cover of granular \ufb02ux. The electrode wire is fed automatically from a coil into the arc.The \ufb02ux is introduced into the joint slightly ahead of the weld arc by gravity from a hopper, as shown in Figure 29.8. The blanket of granular \ufb02ux completely submerges the welding operation, preventing sparks, spatter, and radiation that are so hazardous in other AW processes. Thus, the welding operator in SAW need not wear the somewhat cumbersome face shield required in the other operations (safety glasses and protective gloves, of course, are required). The portion of the \ufb02ux closest to the arc is melted, mixing with the molten weld metal to remove impurities and then solidifying on top of the weld joint to form a glass-like slag.The slag and unfused \ufb02ux granules on top provide good protection from the atmosphere and good thermal insulation for the weld area, resulting in relatively slow cooling and a high-quality weld joint, noted for toughness and ductility. As depicted in the sketch, the unfused \ufb02ux remaining after welding can be recovered and reused. The solid slag covering the weld must be chipped away, usually by manual means. \rSubmerged arc welding is widely used in steel fabrication for structural shapes (e.g., welded I-beams); longitudinal and circumferential seams for large diameter pipes, tanks, and pressure vessels; and welded components for heavy machinery.

Low-carbon, low-alloy, and stainless steels can be readily welded by SAW; but not high-carbon steels, tool steels, and most nonferrous metals. Because of the gravity feed of the granular \ufb02ux, the parts must always be in a horizontal orientation, and a backup plate is often required beneath the joint during the welding operation. \r\r\r29.1.3 AW PROCESSES\u2014NONCONSUMABLE ELECTRODES \rThe AW processes discussed above use consumable electrodes. Gas tungsten arc welding, plasma arc welding, and several other processes use nonconsumable electrodes. \r\r\rSolidified weld metal \r\rBase metal \rMolten weld metal \r\rGas Tungsten Arc Welding Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) is an AW process that uses a nonconsumable tungsten electrode and an inert gas for arc shielding. The term TIG welding (tungsten inert gas welding) is often applied to this process (in Europe, WIG welding is the term\u2014the chemical symbol for tungsten is W, for Wolfram). GTAW can be implemented with or without a \ufb01ller metal. Figure 29.9 illustrates the latter case. When a \ufb01ller metal is used, it is added to the weld pool from a separate rod or wire, being melted by the heat of the arc rather than transferred across the arc as in the consumable electrode AW processes. Tungsten is a good electrode material due to its high melting point of 3410\u00b0C (6170\u00b0F). Typical shielding gases include argon, helium, or a mixture of these gas elements. \rGTAW is applicable to nearly all metals in a wide range of stock thicknesses. It can also be used for joining various combinations of dissimilar metals. Its most common applications are for aluminum and stainless steel. Cast irons, wrought irons, and of course tungsten are dif\ufb01 cult to weld by GTAW. In steel welding applications, GTAW is generally slower and more costly than the consumable electrode AW processes, except when thin sections are involved and very-high-quality welds are required.When thin sheets are TIG welded to close tolerances,\ufb01ller metal is usually not added. The process can be performed manually or by machine and automated methods for all joint types. Advantages of GTAW in the applications to which it is suited include high-quality welds, no weld spatter because no \ufb01ller metal is transferred across the arc, and little or no postweld cleaning because no \ufb02ux is used. \rPlasma Arc Welding Plasma arc welding (PAW) is a special form of gas tungsten arc welding in which a constricted plasma arc is directed at the weld area. In PAW, a tungsten electrode is contained in a specially designed nozzle that focuses a high-velocity stream of inert gas (e.g., argon or argon\u2013hydrogen mixtures) into the region of the arc to form a high-velocity, intensely hot plasma arc stream, as in Figure 29.10. Argon, argon\u2013hydrogen, and helium are also used as the arc-shielding gases. \rTemperatures in plasma arc welding reach 17,000\u00b0C (30,000\u00b0F) or greater, hot enough to melt any known metal. The reason why temperatures are so high in PAW (signi\ufb01cantly higher than those in GTAW) derives from the constriction of the arc. Although the typical power levels used in PAW are below those used in GTAW, the power is highly concentrated to produce a plasma jet of small diameter and very high power density. \rPlasma arc welding was introduced around 1960 but was slow to catch on.

Owing to the special features of PAW, its advantages in these applications include good arc \r\rSolidified weld metal \rstability, better penetration control than most other AW processes, high travel speeds, and excellent weld quality. The process can be used to weld almost any metal, including tungsten. Dif\ufb01 cult-to-weld metals with PAW include bronze, cast irons, lead, and magnesium. Other limitations include high equipment cost and larger torch size than other AW operations, which tends to restrict access in some joint con\ufb01 gurations. \rOther Arc-Welding and Related Processes The preceding AW processes are the most important commercially. There are several others that should be mentioned, which are special cases or variations of the principal AW processes. \rCarbon arc welding (CAW) is an arc-welding process in which a nonconsumable carbon (graphite) electrode is used. It has historical importance because it was the \ufb01rst arc-welding process to be developed, but its commercial importance today is practically nil. The carbon arc process is used as a heat source for brazing and for repairing iron castings. It can also be used in some applications for depositing wear-resistant materials on surfaces. Graphite electrodes for welding have been largely superseded by tungsten (in GTAW and PAW). \rStud welding (SW) is a specialized AW process for joining studs or similar components to base parts. A typical SW operation is illustrated in Figure 29.11, in which shielding is obtained by the use of a ceramic ferrule.To begin with,the stud is chucked in a special weld gun that automatically controls the timing and power parameters of the steps shown in the sequence. The worker must only position the gun at the proper location against the base work part to which the stud will be attached and pull the trigger. SW applications include threaded fasteners for attaching handles to cookware, heat radiation \ufb01ns on machinery, and similar assembly situations. In high-production operations, stud welding usually has advantages over rivets, manually arc-welded attachments, and drilled and tapped holes. \r\r\r\r\r\rResistance Welding \rResistance welding (RW) is a group of fusion-welding processes that uses a combination of heat and pressure to accomplish coalescence, the heat being generated by electrical resistance to current \ufb02ow at the junction to be welded. The principal components in resistance welding are shown in Figure 29.12 for a resistance spot-welding operation, the most widely used process in the group. The components include work parts to be welded (usually sheet metal parts), two opposing electrodes, a means of applying pressure to squeeze the parts between the electrodes, and an AC power supply from which a controlled current can be applied. The operation results in a fused zone between the two parts, called a weld nugget in spot welding. \rBy comparison to arc welding, resistance welding uses no shielding gases, \ufb02ux, or \ufb01ller metal; and the electrodes that conduct electrical power to the process are nonconsumable. RW is classi\ufb01ed as fusion welding because the applied heat almost always causes melting of the faying surfaces. However, there are exceptions. Some welding operations based on resistance heating use temperatures below the melting points of the base metals, so fusion does not occur. \r29.2.1 POWER SOURCE IN RESISTANCE WELDING \rThe heat energy supplied to the welding operation depends on current \ufb02ow, resistance of the circuit, and length of time the current is applied.

The duration t of the current is short in most processes, perhaps lasting 0.1 to 0.4 s in a typical spot-welding operation. \rThe reason why such a high current is used in RW is because (1) the squared term in Equation (29.3) ampli\ufb01es the effect of current, and (2) the resistance is very low (around 0.0001 ). Resistance in the welding circuit is the sum of (1) resistance of the electrodes, (2) resistances of the work parts, (3) contact resistances between electrodes and work parts, and (4) contact resistance of the faying surfaces. Thus, heat is generated in all of these regions of electrical resistance. The ideal situation is for the faying surfaces to be the largest resistance in the sum, because this is the desired location of the weld. The resistance of the electrodes is minimized by using metals with very low resistivities,such as copper.Also,the electrodes are often water cooled to dissipate the heat that is generated there.The work part resistances are a function of the resistivities of the base metals and the part thicknesses. The contact resistances between the electrodes and the parts are determined by the contact areas (i.e., size and shape of the electrode) and the condition of the surfaces (e.g., cleanliness of the work surfaces and scale on the electrode). Finally, the resistance at the faying surfaces depends on surface \ufb01nish, cleanliness, contact area, and pressure. No paint, oil, dirt, or other contaminants should be present to separate the contacting surfaces. \rA resistance spot-welding operation performed on two pieces of 2.5-mm-thick sheet steel uses 12,000 amps for a 0.20-s duration.

The principal functions of pressure in RW are to (1) force contact between the electrodes and the work parts and between the two work surfaces prior to applying current, and \r(2) press the faying surfaces together to accomplish coalescence when the proper welding temperature has been reached. \rGeneral advantages of resistance welding include (1) no \ufb01ller metal is required, (2) high production rates are possible, (3) lends itself to mechanization and automation, (4) operator skill level is lower than that required for arc welding, and (5) good repeatability and reliability. Drawbacks are (1) equipment cost is high\u2014 usually much higher than most arc-welding operations, and (2) types of joints that can be welded are limited to lap joints for most RW processes. \r\r\r\r\r29.2.2 RESISTANCE-WELDING PROCESSES \rThe resistance-welding processes of most commercial importance are spot, seam, and projection welding. \rResistance Spot Welding Resistance spot welding is by far the predominant process in this group. It is widely used in mass production of automobiles, appliances, metal furniture, and other products made of sheet metal. If one considers that a typical car body has approximately 10,000 individual spot welds, and that the annual production of automobiles throughout the world is measured in tens of millions of units, the economic importance of resistance spot welding can be appreciated. \rResistance spot welding (RSW) is an RW process in which fusion of the faying surfaces of a lap joint is achieved at one location by opposing electrodes.The process is used to join sheet-metal parts of thickness 3 mm (0.125 in) or less, using a series of spot welds, in situations where an airtight assembly is not required. The size and shape of the weld spot is determined by the electrode tip, the most common electrode shape being round,but hexagonal,square,and other shapes are also used.The resulting weld nugget is typically 5 to 10 mm (0.2\u20130.4 in) in diameter, with a heat-affected zone extending slightly beyond the nugget into the base metals. If the weld is made properly, its strength will be comparable to that of the surrounding metal. The steps in a spot welding cycle are depicted in Figure 29.13. \rFIGURE 29.13 (a)Steps in a resistancespot-welding (RSW)cycle, and (b) plot ofsqueezing force andcurrent during cycle.The sequence is: (1)parts inserted betweenopen electrodes, (2)electrodes close and force is applied, (3)weld time\u2014current is switched on, (4) current is turned off but force is maintained or increased (a reducedcurrent is sometimes applied near the end ofthis step for stress relief in the weld region),and (5) electrodes areopened, and the welded assembly is removed. \r\r\rFIGURE 29.14 \rRocker-arm spot- welding machine. \rMaterials used for RSW electrodes consist of two main groups: (1) copper-based alloys and (2) refractory metal compositions such as copper and tungsten combinations.The second group is noted for superior wear resistance.As in most manufacturing processes,the tooling in spot welding gradually wears out as it is used.Whenever practical, the electrodes are designed with internal passageways for water cooling. \rBecause of its widespread industrial use, various machines and methods are available to perform spot-welding operations.

The equipment includes rocker-arm and press-type spot-welding machines, and portable spot-welding guns. Rocker-arm spot welders, shown in Figure 29.14, have a stationary lower electrode and a movable upper electrode that can be raised and lowered for loading and unloading the work. The upper electrode is mounted on a rocker arm (hence the name) whose movement is controlled by a foot pedal operated by the worker. Modern machines can be programmed to control force and current during the weld cycle. \rPress-type spot welders are intended for larger work. The upper electrode has a straight-line motion provided by a vertical press that is pneumatically or hydraulically powered. The press action permits larger forces to be applied, and the controls usually permit programming of complex weld cycles. \rThe previous two machine types are both stationary spot welders, in which the work is brought to the machine. For large, heavy work it is dif\ufb01cult to move and position the part into stationary machines. For these cases, portable spot-welding guns are available in various sizes and con\ufb01gurations. These devices consist of two opposing electrodes contained in a pincer mechanism. Each unit is light weight so that it can be held and manipulated by a human worker or an industrial robot. The gun is connected to its own power and control source by means of \ufb02exible electrical cables and air hoses. Water cooling for the electrodes, if needed, can also be provided through a water hose. Portable spot-welding guns are widely used in automobile \ufb01nal assembly plants to spot weld car bodies. Some of these guns are operated by people, but industrial robots have become the preferred technology, illustrated in Figure 38.16. \rResistance Seam Welding In resistance seam welding (RSEW), the stick-shaped electrodes in spot welding are replaced by rotating wheels, as shown in Figure 29.15, and a series of overlapping spot welds are made along the lap joint. The process is capable of producing air-tight joints, and its industrial applications include the production of gasoline tanks, automobile muf\ufb02ers, and various other fabricated the wheel electrodes introduce certain complexities. Because the operation is usually carried out continuously, rather than discretely, the seams should be along a straight or uniformly curved line. Sharp corners and similar discontinuities are dif\ufb01 cult to deal with.Also,warping of the parts becomes more of a factor in resistance seam welding, and \ufb01xtures are required to hold the work in position and minimize distortion. \r\r\rThe spacing between the weld nuggets in resistance seam welding depends on the motion of the electrode wheels relative to the application of the weld current. In the usual method of operation, called continuous motion welding, the wheel is rotated continuously at a constant velocity, and current is turned on at timing intervals consistent with the desired spacing between spot welds along the seam. Frequency of the current discharges is normally set so that overlapping weld spots are produced. But if the frequency is reduced suf\ufb01ciently, then there will be spaces between the weld spots, and this method is termed roll spot welding. In another variation, the welding current remains on at a constant level (rather than being pulsed) so that a truly continuous welding seam is produced. These variations are depicted in Figure 29.16. \rAn alternative to continuous motion welding is intermittent motion welding, in which the electrode wheel is periodically stopped to make the spot weld.The amount of wheel rotation between stops determines the distance between weld spots along the seam, yielding patterns similar to (a) and (b) in Figure 29.16. \rSeam-welding machines are similar to press-type spot welders except that electrode wheels are used rather than the usual stick-shaped electrodes.

These contact points are determined by the design of the parts to be joined, and may consist of projections, embossments, or localized intersections of the parts.A typical case in which two sheet-metal parts are welded together is described in Figure 29.17. The part on top has been fabricated with two embossed points to contact the other part at the start of the process. It might be argued that the embossing operation increases the cost of the part, but this increase may be more than offset by savings in welding cost. \rThere are variations of resistance projection welding, two of which are shown in Figure 29.18. In one variation, fasteners with machined or formed projections can be permanently joined to sheet or plate by RPW, facilitating subsequent assembly operations. Another variation, called cross-wire welding, is used to fabricate welded wire products such as wire fence,shopping carts,and stove grills.In this process,the contacting surfaces of the round wires serve as the projections to localize the resistance heat for welding. \rOther Resistance-Welding Operations In addition to the principal RW processes described above, several additional processes in this group should be identi\ufb01ed: \ufb02ash, upset, percussion, and high-frequency resistance welding. \rIn \ufb02 ash welding (FW), normally used for butt joints, the two surfaces to be joined are brought into contact or near contact and electric current is applied to \r\rFIGURE 29.18 \r\rVariations of resistance projection welding: (a)welding of a machinedor formed fastener onto a sheet-metal part; and\r(b) cross-wire welding. \rFIGURE 29.19 Flash welding (FW): (1)heating by electricalresistance; and (2)upsetting\u2014parts areforced together. \r\rheat the surfaces to the melting point, after which the surfaces are forced together to form the weld. The two steps are outlined in Figure 29.19. In addition to resistance heating, some arcing occurs (called \ufb02 ashing, hence the name of the welding process), depending on the extent of contact between the faying surfaces, so \ufb02ash welding is sometimes classi\ufb01ed in the arc welding group. Current is usually stopped during upsetting. Some metal, as well as contaminants on the surfaces, is squeezed out of the joint and must be subsequently machined to provide a joint of uniform size. \rApplications of \ufb02ash welding include butt welding of steel strips in rolling-mill operations,joining ends of wire in wire drawing,and welding of tubular parts.The ends to be joined must have the same cross sections. For these kinds of high-production applications, \ufb02ash welding is fast and economical, but the equipment is expensive. \rUpset welding (UW) is similar to \ufb02ash welding except that in UW the faying surfaces are pressed together during heating and upsetting. In \ufb02ash welding, the heating and pressing steps are separated during the cycle. Heating in UW is accomplished entirely by electrical resistance at the contacting surfaces; no arcing occurs.

Applications of UW are similar to those of \ufb02ash welding: joining ends of wire, pipes, tubes, and so on. \rPercussion welding (PEW) is also similar to \ufb02ash welding, except that the duration of the weld cycle is extremely short, typically lasting only 1 to 10 ms. Fast heating is accomplished by rapid discharge of electrical energy between the two surfaces to be joined, followed immediately by percussion of one part against the other to form the weld. The heating is very localized, making this process attractive for electronic applications in which the dimensions are very small and nearby components may be sensitive to heat. \rHigh-frequency resistance welding (HFRW) is a resistance-welding process in which a high-frequency alternating current is used for heating, followed by the rapid application of an upsetting force to cause coalescence, as in Figure 29.20(a). The frequencies are 10 to 500 kHz, and the electrodes make contact with the work in the immediate vicinity of the weld joint. In a variation of the process, called high-frequency induction welding (HFIW), the heating current is induced in the parts by a high-frequency induction coil, as in Figure 29.20(b). The coil does not make physical contact with the work. The principal applications of both HFRW and HFIW are continuous butt welding of the longitudinal seams of metal pipes and tubes. \r\r\r\r\rOxyfuel Gas Welding \rOxyfuel gas welding (OFW) is the term used to describe the group of FW operations that burn various fuels mixed with oxygen to perform welding. The OFW processes employ several types of gases, which is the primary distinction among the members of this group. Oxyfuel gas is also commonly used in cutting torches to cut and separate metal plates and other parts (Section 25.3.5).The most important OFW process is oxyacetylene welding. \r\r29.3.1 OXYACETYLENE WELDING \rOxyacetylene welding (OAW) is a fusion-welding process performed by a high-temperature \ufb02ame from combustion of acetylene and oxygen. The \ufb02ame is directed by a welding torch. A \ufb01ller metal is sometimes added, and pressure is occasionally applied in OAW between the contacting part surfaces. A typical OAW operation is sketched in Figure 29.21. When \ufb01ller metal is used, it is typically in the form of a rod with diameters ranging from 1.6 to 9.5 mm (1/16\u20133/8 in). Composition of the \ufb01ller \r\rFIGURE 29.21 \rA typical oxyacetylenewelding operation(OAW). \r\r\r\rmust be similar to that of the base metals.

Acetylene dissolves in liquid acetone; in fact, acetone dissolves about 25 times its own volume of acetylene, thus providing a relatively safe means of storing this welding gas. The welder wears eye and skin protection (goggles, gloves, and protective clothing) as an additional safety precaution, and different screw threads are standard on the acetylene and oxygen cylinders and hoses to avoid accidental connection of the wrong gases. Proper maintenance of the equipment is imperative. OAW equipment is relatively inexpensive and portable. It is therefore an economical, versatile process that is well suited to low-quantity production and repair jobs. It is rarely used to weld sheet and plate stock thicker than 6.4 mm (1/4 in) because of the advantages of arc welding in such applications. Although OAW can be mechanized, it is usually performed manually and is hence dependent on the skill of the welder to produce a high-quality weld joint. \r\r\r29.3.2 ALTERNATIVE GASES FOR OXYFUEL WELDING \rSeveral members of the OFW group are based on gases other than acetylene. Most of the alternative fuels are listed in Table 29.2, together with their burning temperatures and combustion heats. For comparison, acetylene is included in the list. Although oxyacetylene is the most common OFW fuel, each of the other gases can be used in certain applications\u2014typically limited to welding of sheet metal and metals with low melting temperatures, and brazing (Section 30.1). In addition, some users prefer these alternative gases for safety reasons. \rThe fuel that competes most closely with acetylene in burning temperature and heating value is methylacetylene-propadiene. It is a fuel developed by the Dow Chemical Company sold under the trade name MAPP. MAPP (C3H4) has heating characteristics similar to acetylene and can be stored under pressure as a liquid, thus avoiding the special storage problems associated with C2H2. \rWhen hydrogen is burned with oxygen as the fuel, the process is called oxyhydrogen welding (OHW).

When mixed with oxygen it achieves a high temperature \ufb02ame and is becoming more common in small welding shops. \rPressure Gas Welding This is a special OFW process, distinguished by type of application rather than fuel gas. Pressure gas welding (PGW) is a fusion-welding process in which coalescence is obtained over the entire contact surfaces of the two parts by heating them with an appropriate fuel mixture (usually oxyacetylene gas) and then applying pressure to bond the surfaces.A typical application is illustrated in Figure 29.23. \r\r\rParts are heated until melting begins on the surfaces. The heating torch is then withdrawn, and the parts are pressed together and held at high pressure while solidi\ufb01cation occurs. No \ufb01 ller metal is used in PGW. \r\r\r\rOther Fusion-Welding Processes \rSome fusion-welding processes cannot be classi\ufb01ed as arc, resistance, or oxyfuel welding. Each of these other processes uses a unique technology to develop heat for melting; and typically, the applications are unique. \rElectron-Beam Welding Electron-beam welding (EBW) is a fusion-welding process in which the heat for welding is produced by a highly focused, high-intensity stream of electrons impinging against the work surface. The equipment is similar to that used for electron-beam machining (Section 25.3.2).The electron beam gun operates at high voltage to accelerate the electrons (e.g., 10\u2013150 kV typical), and beam currents are low (measured in milliamps). The power in EBW is not exceptional, but power density is. High power density is achieved by focusing the electron beam on a very small area of the work surface, so that the power density PD is based on \rf1EI\rPD ! (29.5)\rA \rwhere PD  power density, W/mm2 (W/in2, which can be converted to Btu/secin2 by dividing by 1055.); f1 ! heat transfer factor (typical values for EBW range from 0.8 to 0.95 [9]); E  accelerating voltage, V; I  beam current, A; and A ! the work surface area on which the electron beam is focused, mm2 (in2). Typical weld areas for EBW range from 13 % 103 to 2000 % 103 mm2 (20 % 106\u20133000 % 106 in2). \rThe process had its beginnings in the 1950s in the atomic power \ufb01eld. When \ufb01rst developed, welding had to be carried out in a vacuum chamber to minimize the disruption of the electron beam by air molecules. This requirement was, and still is, a serious inconvenience in production, due to the time required to evacuate the chamber prior to welding. The pump-down time, as it is called, can take as long as an hour, depending on the size of the chamber and the level of vacuum required. Today, EBW technology has progressed to where some operations are performed without a vacuum. Three categories can be distinguished: (1) high-vacuum welding (EBW-HV), in which welding is carried out in the same vacuum as beam generation; (2) medium-vacuum welding (EBW-MV), in which the operation is performed in a separate chamber where only a partial vacuum is achieved; and (3) nonvacuum welding (EBW-NV), in which welding is accomplished at or near atmospheric pressure.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 50118, "end_char_idx": 54003, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f57987bd-724b-4c8c-8cf1-7c9d6e934eba": {"__data__": {"id_": "f57987bd-724b-4c8c-8cf1-7c9d6e934eba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec29.txt", "file_name": "sec29.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 91669, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75c662af-d62f-4681-bdda-d74c539f91e1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec29.txt", "file_name": "sec29.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 91669, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "ef30b61122ab7c47a53e2ac479fd6dc67895171e72ce784e158e0d6ab315c8b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "145ece7f-778c-4afb-8ade-d2249f540f83", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec29.txt", "file_name": "sec29.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 91669, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "7f4415dc90dd46581f2ab0d76aedc619786c7d9dfd46671966c4b16fc8b011fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "886f7e80-337c-475d-9ce3-229695f254af", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef2f7a06020cb7fc8227f9d263ec8c4f0c61f75a37b0a50869d5ae492dc9b67b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "When \ufb01rst developed, welding had to be carried out in a vacuum chamber to minimize the disruption of the electron beam by air molecules.

The pump-down time during work part loading and unloading is reduced in medium-vacuum EBW and minimized in nonvacuum EBW, but there is a price paid for this advantage. In the latter two operations, the equipment must include one or more vacuum dividers (very small ori\ufb01 ces that impede air \ufb02 ow but permit passage of the electron beam) to separate the beam generator (which requires a high vacuum) from the work chamber. Also, in nonvacuum EBW, the work must be located close to the ori\ufb01ce of the electron beam gun, approximately 13 mm (0.5 in) or less. Finally, the lower vacuum processes cannot achieve the high weld qualities and depth-to-width ratios accomplished by EBW-HV. \r\rFIGURE 29.24 \rElectroslag welding(ESW): (a) front viewwith molding shoeremoved for clarity;\r(b) side view showingschematic of moldingshoe. Setup is similarto electrogas welding(Figure 29.7) except thatresistance heating ofmolten slag is used tomelt the base and \ufb01ller metals. \rAny metals that can be arc welded can be welded by EBW, as well as certain refractory and dif\ufb01cult-to-weld metals that are not suited to AW. Work sizes range from thin foil to thick plate. EBW is applied mostly in the automotive, aerospace, and nuclear industries. In the automotive industry, EBW assembly includes aluminum manifolds, steel torque converters, catalytic converters, and transmission components. In these and other applications, electron-beam welding is noted for high-quality welds with deep and/or narrow pro\ufb01les, limited heat affected zone, and low thermal distortion. Welding speeds are high compared to other continuous welding operations. No \ufb01ller metal is used, and no \ufb02ux or shielding gases are needed. Disadvantages of EBW include high equipment cost, need for precise joint preparation and alignment, and the limitations associated with performing the process in a vacuum, as previously discussed. In addition, there are safety concerns because EBW generates X-rays from which humans must be shielded. \rLaser-Beam Welding Laser-beam welding (LBW) is a fusion-welding process in which coalescence is achieved by the energy of a highly concentrated, coherent light beam focused on the joint to be welded. The term laser is an acronym for light ampli\ufb01cation by stimulated emission of radiation. This same technology is used for laser-beam machining (Section 25.3.3). LBW is normally performed with shielding gases (e.g., helium, argon, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide) to prevent oxidation. Filler metal is not usually added. \rLBW produces welds of high quality, deep penetration, and narrow heat-affected zone.

However, it is not an AW process because an arc is not used during welding. Electroslag welding (ESW) is a fusion-welding process in which coalescence is achieved by hot, electrically conductive molten slag acting on the base parts and \ufb01ller metal. As shown in Figure 29.24, \r\rthe general con\ufb01guration of ESW is similar to electrogas welding. It is performed in a vertical orientation (shown here for butt welding), using water-cooled molding shoes to contain the molten slag and weld metal.At the start of the process,granulated conductive \ufb02ux is put into the cavity. The consumable electrode tip is positioned near the bottom of the cavity, and an arc is generated for a short while to start melting the \ufb02ux. Once a pool of slag has been created, the arc is extinguished and the current passes from the electrode to the base metal through the conductive slag, so that its electrical resistance generates heat to maintain the welding process. Because the density of the slag is less than that of the molten metal, it remains on top to protect the weld pool. Solidi\ufb01cation occurs from the bottom, while additional molten metal is supplied from above by the electrode and the edges of the base parts. The process gradually continues until it reaches the top of the joint. \rThermit Welding Thermit is a trademark name for thermite, a mixture of aluminum powder and iron oxide that produces an exothermic reaction when ignited. It is used in incendiarybombs and for welding.As a welding process,the use ofThermit dates from around 1900. Thermit welding (TW) is a fusion-welding process in which the heat for coalescence is produced by superheated molten metal from the chemical reaction of Thermit. Filler metal is obtained from the liquid metal; and although the process is used for joining, it has more in common with casting than it does with welding. \rFinely mixed powders of aluminum and iron oxide (in a 1:3 mixture), when ignited at a temperature of around 1300\u00b0C (2300\u00b0F), produce the following chemical reaction: \r8Al  3Fe3O4 \u2192 9Fe  4Al2O3  heat (29.6) \rThe temperature from the reaction is around 2500\u00b0C (4500\u00b0F), resulting in superheated molten iron plus aluminum oxide that \ufb02oats to the top as a slag and protects the iron from the atmosphere. In Thermit welding, the superheated iron (or steel if the mixture of powders is formulated accordingly) is contained in a crucible located above the joint to be welded,as indicated by the diagram of theTW process in Figure 29.25.After the reaction is complete (about 30 s, irrespective of the amount of Thermit involved), the crucible is tapped and the liquid metal \ufb02ows into a mold built specially to surround the weld joint.

The surface of the weld in these applications is often suf\ufb01ciently smooth so that no subsequent \ufb01nishing is required. \r\rSolid-State Welding \rIn solid state-welding, coalescence of the part surfaces is achieved by (1) pressure alone, or (2) heat and pressure. For some solid-state processes, time is also a factor. If both heat and pressure are used, the amount of heat by itself is not suf\ufb01cient to cause melting of the work surfaces. In other words, fusion of the parts would not occur using only the heat that is externally applied in these processes. In some cases, the combination of heat and pressure, or the particular manner in which pressure alone is applied, generates suf\ufb01cient energy to cause localized melting of the faying surfaces. Filler metal is not added in solid-state welding. \r29.5.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS IN SOLID-STATE WELDING \rIn most of the solid-state processes, a metallurgical bond is created with little or no melting of the base metals. To metallurgically bond two similar or dissimilar metals, the two metals must be brought into intimate contact so that their cohesive atomic forces attract each other. In normal physical contact between two surfaces, such intimate contact is prohibited by the presence of chemical \ufb01lms, gases, oils, and so on. For atomic bonding to succeed, these \ufb01lms and other substances must be removed. In fusion welding (as well as other joining processes such as brazing and soldering), the \ufb01lms are dissolved or burned away by high temperatures, and atomic bonding is established by the melting and solidi\ufb01cation of the metals in these processes. But in solid-state welding, the \ufb01lms and other contaminants must be removed by other means to allow metallurgical bonding to take place. In some cases, a thorough cleaning of the surfaces is done just before the welding process; while in other cases, the cleaning action is accomplished as an integral part of bringing the part surfaces together. To summarize, the essential ingredients for a successful solid-state weld are that the two surfaces must be very clean, and they must be brought into very close physical contact with each other to permit atomic bonding. \rWelding processes that do not involve melting have several advantages over fusion-welding processes. If no melting occurs, then there is no heat-affected zone, and so the metal surrounding the joint retains its original properties. Many of these processes produce welded joints that comprise the entire contact interface between the two parts, rather than at distinct spots or seams, as in most fusion-welding operations. Also, some of these processes are quite applicable to bonding dissimilar metals, without concerns about relative thermal expansions, conductivities, and other problems that usually arise when dissimilar metals are melted and then solidi\ufb01ed during joining. \r\r29.5.2 SOLID STATE-WELDING PROCESSES \rThe solid-state welding group includes the oldest joining process as well as some of the most modern.

Each process in this group has its own unique way of creating the bond at the faying surfaces.The coverage begins with forge welding,the \ufb01rst welding process. \rForge Welding Forge welding is of historic signi\ufb01 cance in the development of manufacturing technology. The process dates from about 1000 BCE, when blacksmiths of the ancient world learned to join two pieces of metal (Historical Note 29.1). Forge welding is a welding process in which the components to be joined are heated to hot working temperatures and then forged together by hammer or other means. Considerable skill was required by the craftsmen who practiced it to achieve a good weld by present-day standards.The process may be of historic interest;however,it is of minor commercial importance today except for its variants that are discussed below. \rCold Welding Cold welding (CW) is a solid-state welding process accomplished by applying high pressure between clean contacting surfaces at room temperature. The faying surfaces must be exceptionally clean for CW to work, and cleaning is usually done by degreasing and wire brushing immediately before joining. Also, at least one of the metals to be welded, and preferably both, must be very ductile and free of work hardening. Metals such as soft aluminum and copper can be readily cold welded.The applied compression forces in the process result in cold working of the metal parts, reducing thickness by as much as 50%; but they also cause localized plastic deformation at the contacting surfaces, resulting in coalescence. For small parts, the forces may be applied by simple hand-operated tools. For heavier work, powered presses are required to exert the necessary force. No heat is applied from external sources in CW, but the deformation process raises the temperature of the work somewhat. Applications of CW include making electrical connections. \rRoll Welding Roll welding is a variation of either forge welding or cold welding, depending on whether external heating of the work parts is accomplished prior to the process. Roll welding (ROW) is a solid-state welding process in which pressure suf\ufb01cient to cause coalescence is applied by means of rolls, either with or without external application of heat. The process is illustrated in Figure 29.26. If no external heat is supplied, the process is called cold-roll welding; if heat is supplied, the term hot-roll welding is used.Applications of roll welding include cladding stainless steel to mild or low alloy steel for corrosion resistance, making bimetallic strips for measuring temperature, and producing \u201csandwich\u201d coins for the U.S. mint. \rHot Pressure Welding Hot pressure welding (HPW) is another variation of forge welding in which coalescence occurs from the application of heat and pressure suf\ufb01 cient to cause considerable deformation of the base metals.The deformation disrupts the surface oxide \ufb01lm, thus leaving clean metal to establish a good bond between the two parts.Time must be allowed for diffusion to occur across the faying surfaces.The operation is usually carried out in a vacuum chamber or in the presence of a shielding medium. Principal applications of HPW are in the aerospace industry. \r\r\rDiffusion Welding Diffusion welding (DFW) is a solid-state welding process that results from the application of heat and pressure, usually in a controlled atmosphere, with suf\ufb01cient time allowed for diffusion and coalescence to occur.Temperatures are well below the melting points of the metals (about 0.5 Tm is the maximum), and plastic deformation at the surfaces is minimal.The primary mechanism of coalescence is solid-state diffusion, which involves migration of atoms across the interface between contacting surfaces. Applications of DFW include the joining of high-strength and refractory metals in the aerospace and nuclear industries.The process is used to join both similar and dissimilar metals, and in the latter case a \ufb01ller layer of a different metal is often sandwiched between the two base metals to promote diffusion.

The time for diffusion to occur between the faying surfaces can be signi\ufb01cant, requiring more than an hour in some applications [10]. \rExplosion Welding Explosion welding (EXW) is a solid-state welding process in which rapid coalescence of two metallic surfaces is caused by the energy of a detonated explosive. It is commonly used to bond two dissimilar metals, in particular to clad one metal on top of a base metal over large areas.Applications include production of corrosion-resistant sheet and plate stock for making processing equipment in the chemical and petroleum industries. The term explosion cladding is used in this context.No \ufb01ller metal is used in EXW,and no external heat is applied.Also,no diffusion occurs during the process (the time is too short). The nature of the bond is metallurgical, in many cases combined with a mechanical interlocking that results from a rippled or wavy interface between the metals. \rThe process for cladding one metal plate on another can be described with reference to Figure 29.27. In this setup, the two plates are in a parallel con\ufb01guration, separated by a certain gap distance, with the explosive charge above the upper plate, called the \ufb02 yer plate. A buffer layer (e.g., rubber, plastic) is often used between the explosive and the \ufb02yer plate to protect its surface. The lower plate, called the backer metal, rests on an anvil for support. When detonation is initiated, the explosive charge propagates from one end of the \ufb02yer plate to the other, caught in the stop-action view shown in Figure 29.27(2). One of the dif\ufb01culties in comprehending what happens in EXW is the common misconception that an explosion occurs instantaneously; it is actually a progressive reaction, although admittedly very rapid\u2014propagating at rates as high as 8500 m/s (28,000 ft/sec). The resulting high-pressure zone propels the \ufb02yer plate to collide with the backer metal progressively at high velocity, so that it takes on an angular shape as the explosion advances, as illustrated in the sketch.The upper plate remains in position in the region where the explosive has not yet detonated. The high-speed collision, occurring in a progressive and angular fashion as it does, causes the surfaces at the point of contact to become \ufb02uid,and any surface \ufb01lms are expelled forward from the apex of the angle.The colliding surfaces are thus chemically clean, and the \ufb02uid behavior of the metal, which involves some interfacial melting, provides intimate contact between the surfaces, leading to metallurgical bonding. Variations in collision velocity and impact angle during the process can result in a wavy or rippled interface between the two metals. This kind of interface strengthens the bond because it increases the contact area and tends to mechanically interlock the two surfaces. \r\rFriction Welding Friction welding is a widely used commercial process, amenable to automated production methods. The process was developed in the (former) Soviet Union and introduced into the United States around 1960. Friction welding (FRW) is a solid-state welding process in which coalescence is achieved by frictional heat combined with pressure. The friction is induced by mechanical rubbing between the two surfaces, usually by rotation of one part relative to the other, to raise the temperature at the joint interface to the hot working range for the metals involved. Then the parts are driven toward each other with suf\ufb01cient force to form a metallurgical bond.

Friction welding (FRW) is a solid-state welding process in which coalescence is achieved by frictional heat combined with pressure. The friction is induced by mechanical rubbing between the two surfaces, usually by rotation of one part relative to the other, to raise the temperature at the joint interface to the hot working range for the metals involved. Then the parts are driven toward each other with suf\ufb01cient force to form a metallurgical bond. The sequence is portrayed in Figure 29.28 for welding two cylindrical parts, the typical application. The axial compression force upsets the parts, and a \ufb02ash is produced by the material displaced. Any surface \ufb01lms that may have been on the contacting surfaces are expunged during the process. The \ufb02ash must be subsequently trimmed (e.g., by turning) to provide a smooth surface in the weld region.When properly carried out,no melting occurs at the faying surfaces. No \ufb01ller metal, \ufb02ux, or shielding gases are normally used. Figure 29.29 shows the cross section of a friction welded joint. \r\r\r\rFIGURE 29.29 Cross section of a butt joint oftwo steel tubes welded by friction welding.(Courtesy of George E.Kane ManufacturingTechnology Laboratory, Lehigh University.) \rNearly all FRW operations use rotation to develop the frictional heat for welding. There are two principal drive systems, distinguishing two types of FRW: (1) continuous-drive friction welding, and (2) inertia friction welding. In continuous-drive friction welding, one part is driven at a constant rotational speed and forced into contact with the stationary part at a certain force level so that friction heat is generated at the interface. When the proper hot working temperature has been reached, braking is applied to stop the rotation abruptly, and simultaneously the pieces are forced together at forging pressures. In inertia friction welding, the rotating part is connected to a \ufb02ywheel, which is brought up to a predetermined speed. Then the \ufb02ywheel is disengaged from the drive motor, and the parts are forced together. The kinetic energy stored in the \ufb02ywheel is dissipated in the form of friction heat to cause coalescence at the abutting surfaces. The total cycle for these operations is about 20 seconds. \rMachines used for friction welding have the appearance of an engine lathe. They require a powered spindle to turn one part at high speed, and a means of applying an axial force between the rotating part and the nonrotating part. With its short cycle times, the process lends itself to mass production. It is applied in the welding of various shafts and tubular parts in industries such as automotive, aircraft, farm equipment, petroleum, and natural gas. The process yields a narrow heat affected zone and can be used to join dissimilar metals. However, at least one of the parts must be rotational, \ufb02ash must usually be removed, and upsetting reduces the part lengths (which must be taken into consideration in product design). \rThe conventional friction welding operations discussed above utilize a rotary motion to develop the required friction between faying surfaces.A more recent version of the process is linear friction welding, in which a linear reciprocating motion is \rFIGURE 29.30 Friction stir welding (FSW):\r(1) rotating tool justprior to feeding intojoint and (2) partiallycompleted weld seam.N  tool rotation, f  tool feed. \r(Tool rotation) N N \r\r\rf (Tool feed) \rTool \rProbe Shoulder (2)\r\r\rused to generate friction heat between the parts.This eliminates the requirement for at least one of the parts to be rotational (e.g., cylindrical, tubular). \rFriction Stir Welding Friction stir welding (FSW), illustrated in Figure 29.30, is a solid state welding process in which a rotating tool is fed along the joint line between two workpieces, generating friction heat and mechanically stirring the metal to form the weld seam.

The process derives its name from this stirring or mixing action. FSW is distinguished from conventional FRW by the fact that friction heat is generated by a separate wear-resistant tool rather than by the parts themselves. FSW was developed in 1991 at The Welding Institute in Cambridge, UK. \rThe rotating tool is stepped, consisting of a cylindrical shoulder and a smaller probe projecting beneath it. During welding, the shoulder rubs against the top surfaces of the two parts, developing much of the friction heat, while the probe generates additional heat by mechanically mixing the metal along the butt surfaces. The probe has a geometry designed to facilitate the mixing action. The heat produced by the combination of friction and mixing does not melt the metal but softens it to a highly plastic condition.As the tool is fed forward along the joint,the leading surface of the rotating probe forces the metal around it and into its wake, developing forces that forge the metal into a weld seam. The shoulder serves to constrain the plasticized metal \ufb02owing around the probe. \rThe FSW process is used in the aerospace, automotive, railway, and shipbuilding industries. Typical applications are butt joints on large aluminum parts. Other metals, including steel, copper, and titanium, as well as polymers and composites have also been joined using FSW. Advantages in these applications include (1) good mechanical proper ties of the weld joint, (2) avoidance of toxic fumes, warping, shielding issues, and other problems associated with arc welding, (3) little distortion or shrinkage, and (4) good weld appearance. Disadvantages include (1) an exit hole is produced when the tool is withdrawn from the work, and (2) heavy-duty clamping of the parts is required. \r\rFIGURE 29.31 \rUltrasonic welding (USW): (a) general setup for a lap joint; and \r(b) close-up of weld area. \r\rUltrasonic Welding Ultrasonic welding (USW) is a solid-state welding process in which two components are held together under modest clamping force, and oscillatory shear stresses of ultrasonic frequency are applied to the interface to cause coalescence. The operation is illustrated in Figure 29.31 for lap welding, the typical application. The oscillatory motion between the two parts breaks down any surface \ufb01 lms to allow intimate contact and strong metallurgical bonding between the surfaces. Although heating of the contacting surfaces occurs due to interfacial rubbing and plastic deformation, the resulting temperatures are well below the melting point. No \ufb01ller metals, \ufb02uxes, or shielding gases are required in USW. \rThe oscillatory motion is transmitted to the upper work part by means of a sonotrode, which is coupled to an ultrasonic transducer. This device converts electrical power into high-frequency vibratory motion. Typical frequencies used in USW are 15 to 75 kHz, with amplitudes of 0.018 to 0.13 mm (0.0007\u20130.005 in). Clamping pressures are well below those used in cold welding and produce no signi\ufb01cant plastic deformation between the surfaces. Welding times under these conditions are less than 1 sec. \rUSW operations are generally limited to lap joints on soft materials such as aluminum and copper. Welding harder materials causes rapid wear of the sonotrode contacting the upper work part. Work parts should be relatively small, and welding thicknesses less than 3 mm (1/8 in) is the typical case.

The physical integrity of the structure thus formed depends on the quality of the weld. The discussion of weld quality deals primarily with arc welding, the most widely used welding process and the one for which the quality issue is the most critical and complex. \rResidual Stresses and Distortion The rapid heating and cooling in localized regions of the work during fusion welding, especially arc welding, result in thermal expansion andcontractionthatcauseresidual stressesin the weldment.Thesestresses,inturn,can cause distortion and warping of the welded assembly. \r\rAfter welding \rOriginal width \r\r(b) \rshrinkage across the width of the welded assembly; (c) transverse and longitudinal residual stress pattern; and \r\r(d) \rlikely warping in the welded assembly. \r\r\rThe situation in welding is complicated because (1) heating is very localized, \r(2) \rmelting of the base metals occurs in these local regions, and (3) the location of heating and melting is in motion (at least in arc welding). Consider the butt welding of two plates by arc-welding shown in Figure 29.32(a). The operation begins at one end and travels to the opposite end. As it proceeds, a molten pool is formed from the base metal (and \ufb01ller metal, if used) that quickly solidi\ufb01es behind the moving arc. The portions of the work immediately adjacent to the weld bead become extremely hot and expand, while portions removed from the weld remain relatively cool. The weld pool quickly solidi\ufb01 es in the cavity between the two parts, and as it and the surrounding metal cool and contract, shrinkage occurs across the width of the weldment, as seen in Figure 29.32(b). The weld seam is left in residual tension, and reactionary compressive stresses are set up in regions of the parts away from the weld. Residual stresses and shrinkage also occurs along the length of the weld bead. Because the outer regions of the base parts have remained relatively cool and dimensionally unchanged, while the weld bead has solidi\ufb01 ed from very high tempera tures and then contracted, residual tensile stresses remain longitudinally in the weld bead. These transverse and longitudinal stress patterns are depicted in Figure 29.32(c). The net result of these residual stresses, transversely and longitudinally, is likely to cause warping in the welded assembly as shown in Figure 29.32(d). \r\rThe arc-welded butt joint in the example is only one of a variety of joint types and welding operations. Thermally induced residual stresses and the accompanying distortion are a potential problem in nearly all fusion-welding processes and in certain solid-state welding operations in which signi\ufb01cant heating takes place. Following are some techniques to minimize warping in a weldment: (1) Welding \ufb01 xtures can be used to physically restrain movement of the parts during welding. (2) Heat sinks can be used to rapidly remove heat from sections of the welded parts to reduce distortion. \r\r(3) \rTack welding at multiple points along the joint can create a rigid structure prior to \r\r\rWel \rjoint \r\r(b) \r\r\r\rcontinuous seam welding.

(7) Proper design of the weldment itself can reduce the degree of warping. \rWelding Defects In addition to residual stresses and distortion in the \ufb01 nal assembly, other defects can occur in welding. Following is a brief description of each of the major categories, based on a classi\ufb01cation in Cary [3]: \r\u27a2 \rCracks. Cracks are fracture-type interruptions either in the weld itself or in the base metal adjacent to the weld. This is perhaps the most serious welding defect because it constitutes a discontinuity in the metal that signi\ufb01cant reduces weld strength. Several forms are de\ufb01ned in Figure 29.33. Welding cracks are caused by embrittlement or low ductility of the weld and/or base metal combined with high restraint during contraction. Generally, this defect must be repaired. \r\r\u27a2 \rCavities. These include various porosity and shrinkage voids. Porosity consists of small voids in the weld metal formed by gases entrapped during solidi\ufb01 cation. The shapes of the voids vary between spherical (blow holes) to elongated (worm holes). Porosity usually results from inclusion of atmospheric gases, sulfur in the weld metal, or contaminants on the surfaces. Shrinkage voids are cavities formed by shrinkage during solidi\ufb01cation. Both of these cavity-type defects are similar to defects found in castings and emphasize the close kinship between casting and welding. \r\r\u27a2 \rSolid inclusions. These are nonmetallic solid materials trapped inside the weld metal. The most common form is slag inclusions generated during arc-welding processes that use \ufb02ux. Instead of \ufb02oating to the top of the weld pool, globules of slag become encased during solidi\ufb01cation of the metal.Another form of inclusion is metallic oxides that form during the welding of metals such as aluminum, which normally has a surface coating of Al2O3. \r\r\u27a2 \rIncomplete fusion. Several forms of this defect are illustrated in Figure 29.34. Also known as lack of fusion, it is simply a weld bead in which fusion has not occurred throughout the entire cross section of the joint.A related defect is lack of penetration which means that fusion has not penetrated deeply enough into the root of the joint. \r\r\r\r\u27a2 \rImperfect shape or unacceptable contour. The weld should have a certain desired pro\ufb01le for maximum strength, as indicated in Figure 29.35(a) for a single V-groove weld.This weld pro\ufb01le maximizes the strength of the welded joint and avoids incomplete fusion and lack of penetration. Some of the common defects in weld shape and contour are illustrated in Figure 29.35. \r\r\u27a2 \rMiscellaneous defects. This category includes arc strikes, in which the welder accidentally allows the electrode to touch the base metal next to the joint, leaving a scar on the surface; and excessive spatter, in which drops of molten weld metal splash onto the surface of the base parts. \r\r\rInspection and Testing Methods A variety of inspection and testing methods are available to check the quality of the welded joint. Standardized procedures have been developed and speci\ufb01ed over the years by engineering and trade societies such as the American Welding Society (AWS).

Standardized procedures have been developed and speci\ufb01ed over the years by engineering and trade societies such as the American Welding Society (AWS). For purposes of discussion, these inspection and testing procedures can be divided into three categories: (1) visual, (2) nondestructive, and (3) destructive. \rVisual inspection is no doubt the most widely used welding inspection method. An inspector visually examines the weldment for (1) conformance to dimensional speci\ufb01cations on the part drawing, (2) warping, and (3) cracks, cavities, incomplete fusion, and other visible defects. The welding inspector also determines if additional tests are warranted, usually in the nondestructive category. The limitation of visual inspection is that only surface defects are detectable; internal defects cannot be discovered by visual methods. \rNondestructive evaluation (NDE) includes various methods that do not damage the specimen being inspected. Dye-penetrant and \ufb02 uorescent-penetrant tests are methods \r\r\r\r(c) tension\u2013shear test of spot weld, (d) peel test for spot weld. \rfor detecting small defects such as cracks and cavities that are open to the surface. Fluorescent penetrants are highly visible when exposed to ultraviolet light, and their use is therefore more sensitive than dyes. \rSeveral other NDE methods should be mentioned. Magnetic particle testing is limited to ferromagnetic materials. A magnetic \ufb01eld is established in the subject part, and magnetic particles (e.g., iron \ufb01lings) are sprinkled on the surface. Subsurface defects such as cracks and inclusions reveal themselves by distorting the magnetic \ufb01eld, causing the particles to be concentrated in certain regions on the surface. Ultrasonic testing involves the use of high-frequency sound waves ( 20 kHz) directed through the specimen. Discontinuities (e.g., cracks, inclusions, porosity) are detected by losses in sound transmission. Radiographic testing uses X-rays or gamma radiation to detect \ufb02aws internal to the weld metal. It provides a photographic \ufb01lm record of any defects. \rDestructive testing methods in which the weld is destroyed either during the test or to prepare the test specimen. They include mechanical and metallurgical tests. Mechanical tests are similar in purpose to conventional testing methods such as tensile tests and shear tests (Chapter 3). The difference is that the test specimen is a weld joint. Figure 29.36 presents a sampling of the mechanical tests used in welding. Metallurgical tests involve the preparation of metallurgical specimens of the weldment to examine such features as metallic structure, defects, extent and condition of heat-affected zone, presence of other elements, and similar phenomena. \r\r\r\rWeldability \rWeldability is the capacity of a metal or combination of metals to be welded into a suitably designed structure, and for the resulting weld joint(s) to possess the required metallurgical properties to perform satisfactorily in the intended service. Good weld-ability is characterized by the ease with which the welding process is accomplished, absence of weld defects, and acceptable strength, ductility, and toughness in the welded joint. \rFactors that affect weldability include (1) welding process, (2) base metal properties, (3) \ufb01ller metal, and (4) surface conditions. The welding process is signi\ufb01cant. Some metals or metal combinations that can be readily welded by one process are dif\ufb01cult to weld by others. For example, stainless steel can be readily welded by most AW processes, but is considered a dif\ufb01cult metal for oxyfuel welding. \rProperties of the base metal affect welding performance. Important properties include melting point, thermal conductivity, and coef\ufb01cient of thermal expansion. \rOne might think that a lower melting point would mean easier welding. However, some metals melt too easily for good welding (e.g., aluminum). Metals with high thermal conductivity tend to transfer heat away from the weld zone, which can make them hard to weld (e.g., copper). High thermal expansion and contraction in the metal causes distortion problems in the welded assembly. \rDissimilar metals pose special problems in welding when their physical and/or mechanical properties are substantially different.

Brazing and soldering both use \ufb01ller metals to join and bond two (or more) metal parts to provide a permanent joint. It is dif\ufb01cult, although not impossible, to disassemble the parts after a brazed or soldered joint has been made. In the spectrum of joining processes, brazing and soldering lie between fusion welding and solid-state welding. A \ufb01ller metal is added in brazing and soldering as in most fusion-welding operations; however, no melting of the base metals occurs, which is similar to solid-state welding. Despite these anomalies, brazing and soldering are generally considered to be distinct from welding. Brazing and soldering are attractive compared to welding under circumstances where (1) the metals have poor weldability, \r(2) dissimilar metals are to be joined, (3) the intense heat of welding may damage the components being joined, (4) the geometry of the joint does not lend itself to any of the welding methods, and/or (5) high strength is not a requirement. \rAdhesive bonding shares certain features in common with brazing and soldering. It utilizes the forces of attachment between a \ufb01ller material and two closely spaced surfaces to bond the parts. The differences are that the \ufb01ller material in adhesive bonding is not metallic, and the joining process is carried out at room temperature or only modestly above. \r\r\r\r\r\rBrazing \rBrazing is a joining process in which a \ufb01ller metal is melted and distributed by capillary action between the faying surfaces of the metal parts being joined. No melting of the base metals occurs in brazing; only the \ufb01ller melts. In brazing the \ufb01ller metal (also called the \r\rbrazing metal), has a melting temperature (liquidus) that is above 450\u00b0C (840\u00b0F) but below the melting point (solidus) of the base metal(s) to be joined. If the joint is properly designed and the brazing operation has been properly performed, the brazed joint will be stronger than the \ufb01ller metal out of which it has been formed upon solidi\ufb01cation. This rather remarkable result is due to the small part clearances used in brazing, the metallurgical bonding that occurs between base and \ufb01ller metals, and the geometric constrictions that are imposed on the joint by the base parts. Brazing has several advantages compared to welding: (1) any metals can be \rjoined, including dissimilar metals; (2) certain brazing methods can be performed \rquickly and consistently, thus permitting high cycle rates and automated production; \r(3) \rsome methods allow multiple joints to be brazed simultaneously; (4) brazing can be applied to join thin-walled parts that cannot be welded; (5) in general, less heat and power are required than in fusion welding; (6) problems with the heat-affected zone in the base metal near the joint are reduced; and (7) joint areas that are inaccessible by many welding processes can be brazed, since capillary action draws the molten \ufb01ller metal into the joint. \r\rDisadvantages and limitations of brazing include (1) joint strength is generally less than that of a welded joint; (2) although strength of a good brazed joint is greater than that of the \ufb01ller metal, it is likely to be less than that of the base metals; \r\r(3) \rhigh service temperatures may weaken a brazed joint; and (4) the color of the metal in the brazed joint may not match the color of the base metal parts, a possible aesthetic disadvantage.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3873, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50eab95d-64c7-452c-80fc-db4dde15e0ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "50eab95d-64c7-452c-80fc-db4dde15e0ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec30.txt", "file_name": "sec30.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40676, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "34698e7d-c24e-4fe9-9b52-6a7f0b4f1124", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec30.txt", "file_name": "sec30.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40676, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4ad45172260f8f66775463b84c9e5b6702ac9fe8fc4702042b0e0256992a7d05", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f6a7ba3e-71f7-41a4-9d66-dccdc86ae3e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec30.txt", "file_name": "sec30.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40676, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "0d32f988ce8ddf01ed241fbb180ed7dc95670a232e3578a013acb51668537edf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f35d0559-d8ca-4d78-85fa-b5f1bff64b98", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0d3be8e7ca592985789478b6b1f0c9e805f6c58c350eb5df0e54d24dfeb92dec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Disadvantages and limitations of brazing include (1) joint strength is generally less than that of a welded joint; (2) although strength of a good brazed joint is greater than that of the \ufb01ller metal, it is likely to be less than that of the base metals; \r\r(3) \rhigh service temperatures may weaken a brazed joint; and (4) the color of the metal in the brazed joint may not match the color of the base metal parts, a possible aesthetic disadvantage. \r\r\rBrazing as a production process is widely used in a variety of industries, including automotive (e.g., joining tubes and pipes), electrical equipment (e.g., joining wires and cables), cutting tools (e.g., brazing cemented carbide inserts to shanks), and jewelry making. In addition, the chemical processing industry and plumbing and heating contractors join metal pipes and tubes by brazing.The process is used extensively for repair and maintenance work in nearly all industries. \r30.1.1 BRAZED JOINTS \rBrazed joints are commonly of two types: butt and lap (Section 29.2.1). However, the two types have been adapted for the brazing process in several ways. The conventional butt joint provides a limited area for brazing, thus jeopardizing the strength of the joint. To increase the faying areas in brazed joints, the mating parts are often scarfed or stepped or otherwise altered, as shown in Figure 30.1. Of course, additional processing is usually required in the making of the parts for these special joints. \rFIGURE 30.1 \r(a)\r Conventional butt joint, and adaptationsof the butt joint forbrazing: (b) scarf joint,\r\r(c)\r stepped butt joint,\r\r(d)\r increased cross section of the part atthe joint. \r\r\r\r\rOne of the particular dif\ufb01 culties associated with a scarfed joint is the problem of maintaining the alignment of the parts before and during brazing. \rLap joints are more widely used in brazing, since they can provide a relatively large interface area between the parts. An overlap of at least three times the thickness of the thinner part is generally considered good design practice. Some adaptations of the lap joint for brazing are illustrated in Figure 30.2. An advantage of brazing over welding in lap joints is that the \ufb01 ller metal is bonded to the base parts throughout the entire interface area between the parts, rather than only at the edges (as in \ufb01 llet welds made by arc welding) or at discrete spots (as in resistance spot welding). \rClearance between mating surfaces of the base parts is important in brazing. The clearance must be large enough so as not to restrict molten \ufb01ller metal from \ufb02owing throughout the entire interface.Yet if the joint clearance is too great,capillary action will be reduced and there will be areas between the parts where no \ufb01ller metal is present.Joint strength is affected by clearance,as depicted in Figure 30.3.There is an optimum clearance value at which joint strength is maximized. The issue is complicated by the fact that the optimum depends on base and \ufb01ller metals, joint con\ufb01guration, and processing conditions. Typical brazing clearances in practice are 0.025 to \r\r\r0.25 mm (0.001\u20130.010 in). These values represent the joint clearance at the brazing temperature, which may be different from room temperature clearance, depending on thermal expansion of the base metal(s). \rCleanliness of the joint surfaces prior to brazing is also important.

To qualify as a brazing metal, the following characteristics are needed: (1) melting temperature must be compatible with the base metal, (2) surface tension in the liquid phase must be low for good wettability, (3) \ufb02uidity of the molten metal must be high for penetration into the interface, \r(4) the metal must be capable of being brazed into a joint of adequate strength for the application, and (5) chemical and physical interactions with base metal (e.g., galvanic reaction) must be avoided.

Several of these techniques are illustrated in Figures 30.4 and 30.5. Braze metal pastes, shown in Figure 30.5, consist of \ufb01ller metal powders mixed with \ufb02uid \ufb02uxes and binders. \rBrazing \ufb02uxes serve a similar purpose as in welding; they dissolve, combine with, and otherwise inhibit the formation of oxides and other unwanted byproducts in the \rTABLE \u2022 30.1 Common \ufb01ller metals used in brazing and the base metals on which they are used. \rApproximate Brazing Temperature \r\rFiller Metal Typical Composition \u00b0C \u00b0F Base Metals \rAluminum and silicon 90 Al, 10 Si 600 1100 Aluminum Copper 99.9 Cu 1120 2050 Nickel copper Copper and phosphorous 95 Cu, 5 P 850 1550 Copper Copper and zinc 60 Cu, 40 Zn 925 1700 Steels, cast irons, nickel Gold and silver 80 Au, 20 Ag 950 1750 Stainless steel, nickel alloys Nickel alloys Ni, Cr, others 1120 2050 Stainless steel, nickel alloys Silver alloys Ag, Cu, Zn, Cd 730 1350 Titanium, Monel, Inconel, tool \rsteel, nickel \r\rCompiled from [5] and [7]. \r\r(a)\r torch and \ufb01ller rod; \r\r(b)\r ring of \ufb01ller metal at entrance of gap; and\r\r(c)\r foil of \ufb01ller metal between \ufb02at part surfaces.

Referred to as brazing processes, they are differentiated by their heating sources. \rTorch Brazing In torch brazing, \ufb02ux is applied to the part surfaces and a torch is used to direct a \ufb02ame against the work in the vicinity of the joint. A reducing \ufb02ame is typically used to inhibit oxidation. After the work part joint areas have been heated to a suitable temperature, \ufb01ller wire is added to the joint, usually in wire or rod form. Fuels used in torch brazing include acetylene, propane, and other gases, with air or oxygen. The selection of the mixture depends on heating requirements of the job. Torch brazing is often performed manually, and skilled workers must be employed to control the \ufb02 ame, manipulate the hand-held torches, and properly judge the temperatures; repair work is a common application. The method can also be used in mechanized production operations, in which parts and brazing metal are loaded onto a conveyor or indexing table and passed under one or more torches. \r\r\rFurnace Brazing Furnace brazing uses a furnace to supply heat for brazing and is best suited to medium and high production. In medium production, usually in batches, the component parts and brazing metal are loaded into the furnace, heated to brazing temperature, and then cooled and removed. High-production operations use \ufb02ow-through furnaces, in which parts are placed on a conveyor and are transported through the various heating and cooling sections. Temperature and atmosphere control are important in furnace brazing; the atmosphere must be neutral or reducing. Vacuum furnaces are sometimes used. Depending on the atmosphere and metals being brazed, the need for a \ufb02ux may be eliminated. \rInduction Brazing Induction brazing utilizes heat from electrical resistance to a high-frequency current induced in the work. The parts are preloaded with \ufb01ller metal and placed in a high-frequency AC \ufb01eld\u2014the parts do not directly contact the induction coil. Frequencies range from 5 kHz to 5 MHz. High-frequency power sources tend to provide surface heating, while lower frequencies cause deeper heat penetration into the work and are appropriate for heavier sections. The process can be used to meet low- to high-production requirements. \rResistance Brazing Heat to melt the \ufb01ller metal in this process is obtained by resistance to \ufb02ow of electrical current through the parts. As distinguished from induction brazing, the parts are directly connected to the electrical circuit in resistance brazing. The equipment is similar to that used in resistance welding, except that a lower power level is required for brazing. The parts with \ufb01ller metal preplaced are held between electrodes while pressure and current are applied. Both induction and resistance brazing achieve rapid heating cycles and are used for relatively small parts. Induction brazing seems to be the more widely used of the two processes. \rDip Brazing In dip brazing, either a molten salt bath or a molten metal bath accomplishes heating. In both methods, assembled parts are immersed in the baths contained in a heating pot. Solidi\ufb01cation occurs when the parts are removed from the bath. In the salt bath method, the molten mixture contains \ufb02uxing ingredients and the \ufb01ller metal is preloaded onto the assembly. In the metal bath method, the molten \ufb01ller metal is the heating medium; it is drawn by capillary action into the joint during submersion. A \ufb02ux cover is maintained on the surface of the molten metal bath. Dip brazing achieves fast heating cycles and can be used to braze many joints on a single part or on multiple parts simultaneously. \rInfrared Brazing This method uses heat from a high-intensity infrared lamp. Some IR lamps are capable of generating up to 5000 W of radiant heat energy, which can be directed at the work parts for brazing. The process is slower than most of the other processes reviewed above, and is generally limited to thin sections.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 9772, "end_char_idx": 14154, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0eb4de6-c859-46a8-accf-b512abb79555": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0eb4de6-c859-46a8-accf-b512abb79555", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec30.txt", "file_name": "sec30.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40676, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "34698e7d-c24e-4fe9-9b52-6a7f0b4f1124", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec30.txt", "file_name": "sec30.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40676, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4ad45172260f8f66775463b84c9e5b6702ac9fe8fc4702042b0e0256992a7d05", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cbe3fa77-bc29-449c-b0e7-126df573b717", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec30.txt", "file_name": "sec30.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40676, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "13712d3f787e15a61784c3ccaa132eb854b84483915a243832b226cbf80f98b6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "283e0efb-fb15-4627-867a-21c7edcc44c2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "24bb4fa54a6a337955addaeb2acbf8da76a3536ce824ad68f4eb7afabcf95910", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Solidi\ufb01cation occurs when the parts are removed from the bath.

The process is slower than most of the other processes reviewed above, and is generally limited to thin sections. \rBraze Welding This process differs from the other brazing processes in the type of joint to which it is applied. As pictured in Figure 30.6, braze welding is used for \ufb01lling a more conventional weld joint, such as the V-joint shown. A greater quantity of \ufb01ller metal is deposited than in brazing, and no capillary action occurs. In braze welding, the joint consists entirely of \ufb01ller metal; the base metal does not melt and is therefore not fused into the joint as in a conventional fusion welding process. The principal application of braze welding is repair work. \r\r\r\r\r\rSoldering \rSoldering is similar to brazing and can be de\ufb01ned as a joining process in which a \ufb01ller metal with melting point (liquidus) not exceeding 450\u00b0C (840\u00b0F) is melted and distributed by capillary action between the faying surfaces of the metal parts being joined.As in brazing, no melting of the base metals occurs, but the \ufb01ller metal wets and combines with the base metal to form a metallurgical bond. Details of soldering are similar to those of brazing, and many of the heating methods are the same. Surfaces to be soldered must be precleaned so they are free of oxides,oils,and so on.An appropriate \ufb02ux must be applied to the faying surfaces, and the surfaces are heated. Filler metal, called solder, is added to the joint, which distributes itself between the closely \ufb01 tting parts. \rIn some applications, the solder is precoated onto one or both of the surfaces\u2014a process called tinning, irrespective of whether the solder contains any tin. Typical clearances in soldering range from 0.075 to 0.125 mm (0.003\u20130.005 in), except when the surfaces are tinned, in which case a clearance of about 0.025 mm (0.001 in) is used. After solidi\ufb01cation, the \ufb02ux residue must be removed. \rAs an industrial process, soldering is most closely associated with electronics assembly (Chapter 34). It is also used for mechanical joints, but not for joints subjected to elevated stresses or temperatures. Advantages attributed to soldering include (1) low energy input relative to brazing and fusion welding, (2) variety of heating methods available, (3) good electrical and thermal conductivity in the joint, \r(4) capability to make air-tight and liquid-tight seams for containers, and (5) easy to repair and rework. \rThe biggest disadvantages of soldering are (1) low joint strength unless reinforced by mechanical means and (2) possible weakening or melting of the joint in elevated temperature service. \r30.2.1 JOINT DESIGNS IN SOLDERING \rAs in brazing, soldered joints are limited to lap and butt types, although butt joints should not be used in load-bearing applications. Some of the brazing adaptations of these joints also apply to soldering, and soldering technology has added a few more variations of its own to deal with the special part geometries that occur in electrical connections. In soldered mechanical joints of sheet-metal parts, the edges of the sheets are often bent over and interlocked before soldering, as shown in Figure 30.7, to increase joint strength. \rFor electronics applications,the principal function of the soldered joint is to provide an electrically conductive path between two parts being joined.

Mechanical strength in a soldered electrical connection is often achieved by deforming one or both of the metal parts to accomplish a mechanical joint between them, or by making the surface area larger to provide maximum support by the solder. Several possibilities are sketched in Figure 30.8. \r\r30.2.2 SOLDERS AND FLUXES \rSolders and \ufb02uxes are the materials used in soldering. Both are critically important in the joining process. \rFIGURE 30.7 \r\rMechanical interlocking in soldered joints for increased strength:\r(a)\r \ufb02 at lock seam; \r\r\r(b)\r bolted or riveted joint; (c) copper pipe\ufb01 ttings\u2014lap cylindrical joint; and (d) crimping(forming) of cylindricallap joint. \r\r\rFIGURE 30.8 Techniques for securing the joint by mechanical means prior to soldering in electrical connections: \r(a)\r crimped lead wire on printed circuit board (PCB); (b) plated through hole on PCB to maximize solder contact surface; \r\r(c)\r hooked wire on \ufb02 at terminal; and (d) twisted wires. \r\r\rSolders Most solders are alloys of tin and lead, since both metals have low melting points (see Figure 6.3). Their alloys possess a range of liquidus and solidus temperatures to achieve good control of the soldering process for a variety of applications. Lead is poisonous and its percentage is minimized in most solder compositions. Tin is chemically active at soldering temperatures and promotes the wetting action required for successful joining. In soldering copper, common in electrical connections, intermetallic compounds of copper and tin are formed that strengthen the bond. Silver and antimony are also sometimes used in soldering alloys.

Unfortunately, there is no single \ufb02ux that serves all of these functions perfectly for all combinations of solder and base metals. The \ufb02ux formulation must be selected for a given application. \rSoldering \ufb02uxes can be classi\ufb01ed as organic or inorganic. Organic \ufb02 uxes are made of either rosin (i.e., natural rosin such as gum wood, which is not water-soluble) or water-soluble ingredients (e.g., alcohols, organic acids, and halogenated salts). The water-soluble type facilitates cleanup after soldering. Organic \ufb02uxes are most commonly used for electrical and electronics connections. They tend to be chemically reactive at elevated soldering temperatures but relatively noncorrosive at room temperatures. Inorganic \ufb02 uxes consist of inorganic acids (e.g., muriatic acid) and salts (e.g., combinations of zinc and ammonium chlorides) and are used to achieve rapid and active \ufb02uxing where oxide \ufb01lms are a problem. The salts become active when melted, but are less corrosive than the acids. When solder wire is purchased with an acid core it is in this category. \rBoth organic and inorganic \ufb02uxes should be removed after soldering, but it is especially important in the case of inorganic acids to prevent continued corrosion of the metal surfaces. Flux removal is usually accomplished using water solutions except in the case of rosins, which require chemical solvents. Recent trends in industry favor water-soluble \ufb02uxes over rosins because chemical solvents used with rosins are harmful to the environment and to humans. \r\r30.2.3 SOLDERING METHODS \rMany of the methods used in soldering are the same as those used in brazing, except that less heat and lower temperatures are required for soldering. These methods include torch soldering, furnace soldering, induction soldering, resistance soldering, dip soldering, and infrared soldering. There are other soldering methods, not used in brazing, that should be described here. These methods are hand soldering, wave soldering, and re\ufb02ow soldering. \rHand Soldering Hand soldering is performed manually using a hot soldering iron. A bit, made of copper, is the working end of a soldering iron. Its functions are \r(1) to deliver heat to the parts being soldered, (2) to melt the solder, (3) to convey molten solder to the joint, and (4) to withdraw excess solder. Most modern soldering irons are heated by electrical resistance. Some are designed as fast-heating soldering guns, which are popular in electronics assembly for intermittent (on-off) operation actuated by a trigger. They are capable of making a solder joint in about a second. \rWave Soldering Wave soldering is a mechanized technique that allows multiple lead wires to be soldered to a printed circuit board (PCB) as it passes over a wave of molten solder.The typical setup is one in which a PCB, on which electronic components have been placed with their lead wires extending through the holes in the board, is loaded onto a conveyor for transport through the wave-soldering equipment. The conveyor supports the PCB on its sides, so that its underside is exposed to the processing steps, which consist of the following: (1) \ufb02 ux is applied using any of several methods, including foaming, spraying, or brushing; (2) preheating (using light bulbs, heating coils, and infrared devices) to evaporate solvents, activate the \ufb02 ux, and raise the temperature of the assembly; and (3) wave soldering, in which the liquid solder is pumped from a molten bath through a slit onto the bottom of the board to make the soldering connections between the lead wires and the metal circuit on the board. This third step is illustrated in Figure 30.9. The board is often inclined slightly, as depicted in the sketch, and a special tinning oil is mixed with the molten solder to lower its surface tension. Both of these measures help to inhibit buildup of excess solder and formation of \u201cicicles\u201d on the bottom of the board.

Wave soldering is widely applied in electronics to produce printed circuit board assemblies (Section 35.3.2). \rRe\ufb02ow Soldering This process is also widely used in electronics to assemble surface mount components to printed circuit boards (Section 35.4.2). In the process, a solder paste consisting of solder powders in a \ufb02ux binder is applied to spots on the board where electrical contacts are to be made between surface mount components and the copper circuit. The components are then placed on the paste spots, and the board is heated to melt the solder, forming mechanical and electrical bonds between the component leads and the copper on the circuit board. \rHeating methods for re\ufb02ow soldering include vapor phase re\ufb02ow and infrared re\ufb02ow. In vapor phase re\ufb02 ow soldering, an inert \ufb02uorinated hydrocarbon liquid is vaporized by heating in an oven; it subsequently condenses on the board surface where it transfers its heat of vaporization to melt the solder paste and form solder joints on the printed circuit boards. In infrared re\ufb02 ow soldering, heat from an infrared lamp is used to melt the solder paste and form joints between component leads and circuit areas on the board.Additional heating methods to re\ufb02ow the solder paste include use of hot plates, hot air, and lasers. \r\r\r\r\r\rAdhesive Bonding \rUse of adhesives dates back to ancient times (Historical Note 30.1) and adhesive bonding was probably the \ufb01rst of the permanent joining methods. Today, adhesives are used in a wide range of bonding and sealing applications for joining similar and dissimilar materials such as metals, plastics, ceramics, wood, paper, and cardboard. Although well-established as a joining technique, adhesive bonding is considered a growth area among assembly technologies because of the tremendous opportunities for increased applications. \rHistorical Note 30.1 Adhesive bonding \rAdhesives date from ancient times.

If heat is required, the curing temperatures are relatively low, and so the materials being joined are usually unaffected\u2014an advantage for adhesive bonding.The curing or hardening of the adhesive takes time,called curing time or setting time. In some cases this time is signi\ufb01 cant\u2014generally a disadvantage in manufacturing. \rJoint strength in adhesive bonding is determined by the strength of the adhesive itself and the strength of attachment between adhesive and each of the adherends. One of the criteria often used to de\ufb01ne a satisfactory adhesive joint is that if a failure should occur due to excessive stresses, it occurs in one of the adherends rather than at an interface or within the adhesive itself. The strength of the attachment results from several mechanisms, all depending on the particular adhesive and adherends: \r(1) \rchemical bonding, in which the adhesive unites with the adherends and forms a primary chemical bond upon hardening; (2) physical interactions, in which secondary bonding forces result between the atoms of the opposing surfaces; and (3) mechanical interlocking, in which the surface roughness of the adherend causes the hardened adhesive to become entangled or trapped in its microscopic surface asperities. \r\rFor these adhesion mechanisms to operate with best results, the following conditions must prevail: (1) surfaces of the adherend must be clean\u2014free of dirt, oil, and oxide \ufb01lms that would interfere with achieving intimate contact between adhesive and adherend; special preparation of the surfaces is often required; (2) the adhesive in its initial liquid form must achieve thorough wetting of the adherend surface; and \r\r(3) \rit is usually helpful for the surfaces to be other than perfectly smooth\u2014a slightly roughened surface increases the effective contact area and promotes mechanical interlocking. In addition, the joint must be designed to exploit the particular strengths of adhesive bonding and avoid its limitations. \r\r\r\r30.3.1 JOINT DESIGN \rAdhesive joints are not generally as strong as those by welding, brazing, or soldering. Accordingly, consideration must be given to the design of joints that are adhesively bonded. The following design principles are applicable: (1) Joint contact area should be maximized. (2) Adhesive joints are strongest in shear and tension as in Figure 30.10(a) and (b), and joints should be designed so that the applied stresses are of these types. (3) Adhesive bonded joints are weakest in cleavage or peeling as in Figure 30.10(c) and (d), and adhesive bonded joints should be designed to avoid these types of stresses. \rTypical joint designs for adhesive bonding that illustrate these design principles are presented in Figure 30.11. Some joint designs combine adhesive bonding with other joining methods to increase strength and/or provide sealing between the two components. Some of the possibilities are shown in Figure 30.12.

They include a variety of thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers, many of which are listed and brie\ufb02y described in Table 30.3.They are cured by various mechanisms, such as (1) mixing a catalyst or reactive ingredient with the polymer immediately prior to applying, (2) heating to initiate the chemical reaction, (3) radiation curing, such as ultraviolet light, and (4) curing by evaporation of water from the liquid or paste adhesive. In addition, some synthetic adhesives are applied as \ufb01lms or as pressure-sensitive coatings on the surface of one of the adherends. \r\r\r30.3.3 ADHESIVE APPLICATION TECHNOLOGY \rIndustrial applications of adhesive bonding are widespread and growing. Major users are automotive, aircraft, building products, and packaging industries; other industries include footwear,furniture,bookbinding,electrical,and shipbuilding.Table 30.3 indicates some of the speci\ufb01 c applications for which synthetic adhesives are used. This section considers several issues relating to adhesives application technology. \rSurface Preparation In order for adhesive bonding to succeed, part surfaces must be extremely clean. The strength of the bond depends on the degree of adhesion between adhesive and adherend, and this depends on the cleanliness of the surface. \r\rIn most cases, additional processing steps are required for cleaning and surface preparation, the methods varying with different adherend materials. For metals, solvent wiping is often used for cleaning, and abrading the surface by sand blasting or other process usually improves adhesion. For nonmetallic parts, solvent cleaning is generally used, and the surfaces are sometimes mechanically abraded or chemically etched to increase roughness. It is desirable to accomplish the adhesive bonding process as soon as possible after these treatments, since surface oxidation and dirt accumulation increase with time. \rApplication Methods The actual application of the adhesive to one or both part surfaces is accomplished in a number of ways. The following list, though incomplete, provides a sampling of the techniques used in industry: \r\u27a2 \rBrushing, performed manually, uses a stiff-bristled brush. Coatings are often uneven. \r\r\u27a2 \rFlowing, using manually operated pressure-fed \ufb02ow guns, has more consistent control than brushing. \r\r\u27a2 \rManual rollers, similar to paint rollers, are used to apply adhesive from a \ufb02at container. \r\r\u27a2 \rSilk screening involves brushing the adhesive through the open areas of the screen onto the part surface, so that only selected areas are coated. \r\r\u27a2 \rSpraying uses an air-driven (or airless) spray gun for fast application over large or dif\ufb01cult-to-reach areas. \r\r\u27a2 \rAutomatic applicators include various automatic dispensers and nozzles for use on medium- and high-speed production applications. Figure 30.13 illustrates the use of a dispenser for assembly. \r\r\r\r\r\u27a2 Roll coating is a mechanized technique in which a rotating roller is partially submersed in a pan of liquid adhesive and picks up a coating of the adhesive, which is then transferred to the work surface. Figure 30.14 shows one possible application, in which the work is a thin, \ufb02exible material (e.g., paper, cloth, leather, plastic).Variations of the method are used for coating adhesive onto wood,wood composite, cardboard, and similar materials with large surface areas.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 34350, "end_char_idx": 38507, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "318f257f-ae11-4231-b4ba-d0e184787a32": {"__data__": {"id_": "318f257f-ae11-4231-b4ba-d0e184787a32", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec30.txt", "file_name": "sec30.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40676, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "34698e7d-c24e-4fe9-9b52-6a7f0b4f1124", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec30.txt", "file_name": "sec30.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40676, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4ad45172260f8f66775463b84c9e5b6702ac9fe8fc4702042b0e0256992a7d05", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d391d5b3-4110-4b5d-9a2b-c2dc6b067764", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec30.txt", "file_name": "sec30.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 40676, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "84f1a079a4e3741f27660a1c399e268ba45b3c8b2c1efc21d0938da49dafe824", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u27a2 \rSpraying uses an air-driven (or airless) spray gun for fast application over large or dif\ufb01cult-to-reach areas. \r\r\u27a2 \rAutomatic applicators include various automatic dispensers and nozzles for use on medium- and high-speed production applications.

In most cases, the method involves the use of discrete hardware components, called fasteners, that are added to the parts during the assembly operation. In other cases, the method involves the shaping or reshaping of one of the components being assembled, and no separate fasteners are required. Many consumer products are produced using mechanical assembly: automobiles, large and small appliances, telephones, furniture, utensils\u2014even wearing apparel is \u201cassembled\u201d by mechanical means. In addition, industrial products such as airplanes, machine tools, and construction equipment almost always involve mechanical assembly. \rMechanical fastening methods can be divided into two major classes: (1) those that allow for disassembly, and (2) those that create a permanent joint. Threaded fasteners (e.g., screws, bolts, and nuts) are examples of the \ufb01rst class, and rivets illustrate the second. There are good reasons why mechanical assembly is often preferred over other joining processes discussed in previous chapters.The main reasons are (1) ease of assembly and (2) ease of disassembly (for the fastening methods that permit disassembly). \rMechanical assembly is usually accomplished by unskilled workers with a minimum of special tooling and in a relatively short time. The technology is simple, and the results are easily inspected. These factors are advantageous not only in the factory, but also during \ufb01eld installation. Large products that are too big and heavy to be transported completely assembled can be shipped in smaller subassemblies and then put together at the customer\u2019s site. \rEase of disassembly applies, of course, only to the mechanical fastening methods that permit disassembly. Periodic disassembly is required for many products so that maintenance and repair can be performed; for example, to replace worn-out components, to make adjustments, and so forth. Permanent joining techniques such as welding do not allow for disassembly. \rFor purposes of organization, mechanical assembly methods are divided into the following categories: (1) threaded fasteners, (2) rivets, (3) interference \ufb01ts, (4) other mechanical fastening methods, and (5) molded-in inserts and integral fasteners. These categories are described in Sections 31.1 through 31.5. Section 31.6 discusses the important topic of design for assembly.Assembly of electronic products includes mechanical techniques. However, electronics assembly represents a specialized \ufb01eld, which is covered in Chapter 34. \r\r\r\r\rThreaded Fasteners \rThreaded fasteners are discrete hardware components that have external or internal threads for assembly of parts. In nearly all cases, they permit disassembly. Threaded fasteners are the most important category of mechanical assembly; the common threaded fastener types are screws, bolts, and nuts. \r31.1.1 SCREWS, BOLTS, AND NUTS \rScrews and bolts are threaded fasteners that have external threads. There is a technical distinction between a screw and a bolt that is often blurred in popular usage. A screw is an externally threaded fastener that is generally assembled into a blind threaded hole. Some types, called self-tapping screws, possess geometries that permit them to form or cut the matching threads in the hole. A bolt is an externally threaded fastener that is inserted through holes in the parts and \u201cscrewed\u201d into a nut on the opposite side. A nut is an internally threaded fastener having standard threads that match those on bolts of the same diameter, pitch, and thread form. The typical assemblies that result from the use of screws and bolts are illustrated in Figure 31.1. \rScrews and bolts come in a variety of standard sizes,threads,and shapes.Table 31.1 provides a selection of common threaded fastener sizes in metric units (ISO standard) and U.S.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4398, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71c9d032-e86e-4bf2-a74f-be7b5bf82dca": {"__data__": {"id_": "71c9d032-e86e-4bf2-a74f-be7b5bf82dca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec31.txt", "file_name": "sec31.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42808, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dfcd7046-730f-4b0f-b7e6-0f4d18deee45", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec31.txt", "file_name": "sec31.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42808, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "5ff4af92ef54a8fef6d5cd18b295ecf86df2f9077aaf89b48608fbd8123ca2d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b10f1b7-024d-438f-949b-0b26fb6120a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec31.txt", "file_name": "sec31.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42808, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "1fbf2d6964ea67967da015102e369caa02b09d40d3645bd58417bc18f9c95b2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "69b2761d-22a7-4d04-864a-c2f2e840d9a2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4db8f9acaa81fefbb54c2d9b179121cf1362b6e78954aa6629fb49c0ce6e88e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "There is a technical distinction between a screw and a bolt that is often blurred in popular usage.

For example, a speci\ufb01cation of 4 ! 0.7 means a 4.0-mm major diameter and a pitch of 0.7 mm. The U.S. standard speci\ufb01es either a number designating the major diameter (up to 0.2160 in) or the nominal major diameter, in, followed by the number of threads per inch. For example, the speci\ufb01cation 1/4-20 indicates a major diameter of 0.25 in and 20 threads per inch. Both coarse pitch and \ufb01ne pitch standards are given in Table 31.1. \rFIGURE 31.1 Typical assemblies using\r(a)\r bolt and nut, and \r\r(b)\r screw. \r\r\r\r1ISO is the abbreviation for the International Standards Organization.

The United States has been gradually converting to metric thread sizes, which will reduce proliferation of speci\ufb01cations. It should be noted that differences among threaded fasteners have tooling implications in manufacturing. To use a particular type of screw or bolt, the assembly worker must have tools that are designed for that fastener type. For example, there are numerous head styles available on bolts and screws, the most common of which are shown in Figure 31.2. The geometries of these heads, as well as the variety of sizes available, require different hand tools (e.g., screwdrivers) for the worker.

To use a particular type of screw or bolt, the assembly worker must have tools that are designed for that fastener type. For example, there are numerous head styles available on bolts and screws, the most common of which are shown in Figure 31.2. The geometries of these heads, as well as the variety of sizes available, require different hand tools (e.g., screwdrivers) for the worker. One cannot turn a hexhead bolt with a conventional \ufb02at-blade screwdriver. \rScrews come in a greater variety of con\ufb01gurations than bolts, since their functions vary more. The types include machine screws, capscrews, setscrews, and self-tapping screws. Machine screws are the generic type, designed for assembly into tapped holes. They are sometimes assembled to nuts, and in this usage they overlap with bolts. Capscrews have the same geometry as machine screws but are made of higher strength metals and to closer tolerances. Setscrews are hardened and designed for \r\r\rFIGURE 31.3 (a) Assembly of collar to shaft using a setscrew; (b) various setscrew geometries (head types and points). \rFIGURE 31.4 \rSelf-tapping screws:\r(a)\r thread-forming and\r\r(b)\r thread-cutting. \r\r\r\rassembly functions such as fastening collars, gears, and pulleys to shafts as shown in Figure 31.3(a). They come in various geometries, some of which are illustrated in Figure 31.3(b). A self-tapping screw (also called a tapping screw) is designed to form or cut threads in a preexisting hole into which it is being turned. Figure 31.4 shows two of the typical thread geometries for self-tapping screws. \rMost threaded fasteners are produced by cold forming (Section 18.2). Some are machined (Sections 21.2.2 and 21.7.1), but this is usually a more expensive thread-making process. A variety of materials are used to make threaded fasteners, steels being the most common because of their good strength and low cost. These include low and medium carbon as well as alloy steels. Fasteners made of steel are usually plated or coated for super\ufb01cial resistance to corrosion. Nickel, chromium, zinc, black oxide, and similar coatings are used for this purpose. When corrosion or other factors deny the use of steel fasteners, other materials must be used, including stainless steels, aluminum alloys, nickel alloys, and plastics (however, plastics are suited to low stress applications only). \r\r31.1.2 OTHER THREADED FASTENERS AND RELATED HARDWARE \rAdditional threaded fasteners and related hardware include studs, screw thread inserts, captive threaded fasteners, and washers. A stud (in the context of fasteners) is an externally threaded fastener, but without the usual head possessed by a bolt. Studs can be used to assemble two parts using two nuts as shown in Figure 31.5(a). They are available with threads on one end or both as in Figure 31.5(b) and (c). \rScrew thread inserts are internally threaded plugs or wire coils made to be inserted into an unthreaded hole and to accept an externally threaded fastener. They are assembled into weaker materials (e.g., plastic, wood, and light-weight metals such as magnesium) to provide strong threads. There are many designs of screw thread inserts, one example of which is illustrated in Figure 31.6. Upon subsequent assembly \rFIGURE 31.5 \r(a)\r Stud and nuts used for assembly.

Two types of captive threaded fasteners are illustrated in Figure 31.7. \rA washer is a hardware component often used with threaded fasteners to ensure tightness of the mechanical joint; in its simplest form, it is a \ufb02at, thin ring of sheet metal.Washers serve various functions.They (1) distribute stresses that might otherwise be concentrated at the bolt or screw head and nut, (2) provide support for large clearance holes in the assembled parts, (3) increase spring tension, (4) protect part surfaces, (5) seal the joint, and (6) resist inadvertent unfastening [13].

Shown in the \ufb01gure is a bolt-and-nut assembly. Once tightened, the bolt is loaded in tension, and the parts are loaded in compression. In addition, forces may be acting in opposite directions on the parts, which results in a shear stress on the bolt cross section.

Thread stripping, failures (1) and (2), is a shear failure and occurs when the length of engagement is too short (less than about 60% of the nominal bolt diameter). This can be avoided by providing adequate thread engagement in the fastener design. Tensile failure (3) is the most common problem. The bolt breaks at about 85% of its rated tensile strength because of combined tensile and torsion stresses during tightening [2]. \rThe tensile stress to which a bolt is subjected can be calculated as the tensile load applied to the joint divided by the applicable area: \r___ F \rs \" (31.1)\rAs \rwhere s  stress, MPa (lb/in2); F  load, N (lb); and As  tensile stress area, mm2 (in2). This stress is compared to the bolt strength values listed in Table 31.2. The tensile stress area for a threaded fastener is the cross-sectional area of the minor diameter. This area can be calculated directly from one of the following equations [2], depending on whether the bolt is metric standard or American standard. For the metric standard (ISO), the formula is \rAs \" __p (D0.9382p)2 (31.2)\r4 \rwhere D \" nominal size (basic major diameter) of the bolt or screw, mm; and p  thread pitch, mm.

Available tools range from simple hand-held screwdrivers or wrenches to powered tools with sophisticated electronic sensors to ensure proper tightening. It is important that the tool match the screw or bolt and/ or the nut in style and size, since there are so many heads available. Hand tools are usually made with a single point or blade, but powered tools are generally designed to use interchangeable bits. The powered tools operate by pneumatic, hydraulic, or electric power. \rWhether a threaded fastener serves its intended purpose depends to a large degree on the amount of torque applied to tighten it. Once the bolt or screw (or nut) has been rotated until it is seated against the part surface, additional tightening will increase the tension in the fastener (and simultaneously the compression in the parts being held together); and the tightening will be resisted by an increasing torque. Thus, there is a correlation between the torque required to tighten the fastener and the tensile stress experienced by it. To achieve the desired function in the assembled joint (e.g., to improve fatigue resistance) and to lock the threaded fasteners, the product designer will often specify the tension force that should be applied. This force is called the preload. The following relationship can be used to determine the required torque to obtain a speci\ufb01ed preload [13]: \rT \" CtDF (31.4) \rwhere T \" torque, N-mm (lb-in); Ct \" the torque coef\ufb01cient whose value typically ranges between 0.15 and 0.25, depending on the thread surface conditions; D \" nominal bolt or screw diameter, mm (in); and F \" speci\ufb01ed preload tension force, N (lb). \rA Metric 8  1.25 bolt must be tightened to a preload of 275 N.

Riveting is a fastening method that offers high production rates, simplicity, dependability, and low cost. Despite these apparent advantages, its applications have declined in recent decades in favor of threaded fasteners, welding, and adhesive bonding. Riveting is one of the primary fastening processes in the aircraft and aerospace industries for joining skins to channels and other structural members. \rA rivet is an unthreaded, headed pin used to join two (or more) parts by passing the pin through holes in the parts and then forming (upsetting) a second head in the pin on the opposite side. The deforming operation can be performed hot or cold (hot working or cold working), and by hammering or steady pressing. Once the rivet has been deformed, it cannot be removed except by breaking one of the heads. Rivets are speci\ufb01 ed by their length, diameter, head, and type. Rivet type refers to \ufb01 ve basic geometries that affect how the rivet will be upset to form the second head.The \ufb01ve types are de\ufb01ned in Figure 31.10. In addition, there are special rivets for special applications. \rRivets are used primarily for lap joints. The clearance hole into which the rivet is inserted must be close to the diameter of the rivet. If the hole is too small, rivet insertion will be dif\ufb01cult, thus reducing production rate. If the hole is too large, the rivet will not \ufb01ll the hole and may bend or compress during formation of the opposite head. Rivet design tables are available to specify the optimum hole sizes. \rThe tooling and methods used in riveting can be divided into the following categories: (1) impact, in which a pneumatic hammer delivers a succession of blows to upset the rivet; (2) steady compression, in which the riveting tool applies a continuous squeezing pressure to upset the rivet; and (3) a combination of impact and compression.

Much of the equipment used in riveting is portable and manually operated. Automatic drilling-and-riveting machines are available for drilling the holes and then inserting and upsetting the rivets. \rEyelets are thin-walled, tubular fasteners with a \ufb02 ange on one end, usually made from sheet metal, as in Figure 31.11(a). They are used to produce a permanent lap joint between two (or more) \ufb02 at parts. Eyelets are substituted for rivets in low-stress applications to save material, weight, and cost. During fastening, the eyelet is inserted through the part holes, and the straight end is formed over to secure the assembly. \rFIGURE 31.10 \rFive basic rivet types,also shown in assembled con\ufb01guration: \r(a)\r solid, (b) tubular, \r\r(c)\r semitubular, \r\r(d)\r bifurcated, and \r\r(e)\r compression. \r\r\r\rFIGURE 31.11 \rFastening with an eyelet: \r(a) \rthe eyelet, and \r\r(b) \rassembly sequence: \r\r(1) \rinserting the eyelet through the hole, and \r\r(2)\r setting operation. \r\r\r\rThe forming operation is called setting and is performed by opposing tools that hold the eyelet in position and curl the extended portion of its barrel. Figure 31.11(b) illustrates the sequence for a typical eyelet design. Applications of this fastening method include automotive subassemblies, electrical components, toys, and apparel. \r\rAssembly Methods Based on Interference Fits \rSeveral assembly methods are based on mechanical interference between the two mating parts being joined. This interference, which occurs either during assembly or after the parts are joined,holds the parts together.The methods include press \ufb01tting, shrink and expansion \ufb01ts, snap \ufb01ts, and retaining rings. \rPress Fitting A press \ufb01t assembly is one in which the two components have an interference \ufb01t between them. The typical case is where a pin (e.g., a straight cylindrical pin) of a certain diameter is pressed into a hole of a slightly smaller diameter. Standard pin sizes are commercially available to accomplish a variety of functions, such as (1) locating and locking the components\u2014used to augment threaded fasteners by holding two (or more) parts in \ufb01xed alignment with each other; (2) pivot points, to permit rotation of one component about the other; and (3) shear pins. Except for (3), the pins are normally hardened. Shear pins are made of softer metals so as to break under a sudden or severe shearing load to save the rest of the assembly. Other applications of press \ufb01tting include assembly of collars, gears, pulleys, and similar components onto shafts. \rThe pressures and stresses in an interference \ufb01t can be estimated using several applicable formulas. If the \ufb01t consists of a round solid pin or shaft inside a collar (or similar component), as depicted in Figure 31.12, and the components are made of the same material, the radial pressure between the pin and the collar can be determined by [13]: \rEi(Dc 2 # D2 p)Pf \" DpDc 2 (31.5) \rFIGURE 31.12 Cross section of a solid pin or shaft assembled to a collar by interference \ufb01 t. \r\rwhere pf \" radial or interference \ufb01t pressure, MPa (lb/in2); E \" modulus of elasticity for the material; i \" interference between the pin (or shaft) and the collar; that is, the starting difference between the inside diameter of the collar hole and the outside diameter of the pin, mm (in); Dc \" outside diameter of the collar, mm (in); and Dp \" pin or shaft diameter, mm (in).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 18629, "end_char_idx": 22411, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5feb1e3-0ce2-407f-a08a-10d020a47244": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5feb1e3-0ce2-407f-a08a-10d020a47244", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec31.txt", "file_name": "sec31.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42808, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dfcd7046-730f-4b0f-b7e6-0f4d18deee45", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec31.txt", "file_name": "sec31.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42808, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "5ff4af92ef54a8fef6d5cd18b295ecf86df2f9077aaf89b48608fbd8123ca2d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6b2ef43e-a528-40a6-bb88-2f4543126134", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec31.txt", "file_name": "sec31.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42808, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "80ccdfcc19468e0824e269b25f88eb450e67180d879cb367ec7f70ab55b8b753", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "20ff5f6e-0b4f-4fc4-b1d9-52bda0a9126b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9041154831389fbbd4bcf2578368ff74634f643cf97a9f171f3af14cd0ec92d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The maximum effective stress occurs in the collar at its inside diameter and can be calculated as \r22pf Dc\rMax se \" 22 (31.6)\rDcDp \rwhere Max se \" the maximum effective stress, MPa (lb/in2), and pf is the interference \ufb01t pressure computed from Equation (31.5). \rIn situations in which a straight pin or shaft is pressed into the hole of a large part with geometry other than that of a collar, the previous equations can be simpli\ufb01ed by taking the outside diameter Dc to be in\ufb01nite, thus reducing the equation for interfer\rence pressure to  \rEipf ___ \" Dp  (31.7)  \rand the corresponding maximum effective stress becomes  \rMax se  2pf  (31.8)  \r\rIn most cases, particularly for ductile metals, the maximum effective stress should be compared with the yield strength of the material, applying an appropriate safety factor, as in the following: \rY\rMax se $ (31.9)\rSF \rwhere Y  yield strength of the material, and SF is the applicable safety factor. \rVarious pin geometries are available for interference \ufb01ts. The basic type is a straight pin, usually made from cold-drawn carbon steel wire or bar stock, ranging in diameter from 1.6 to 25 mm (1/16\u20131.0 in). They are unground, with chamfered or square ends (chamfered ends facilitate press \ufb01tting). Dowel pins are manufactured to more precise speci\ufb01cations than straight pins, and can be ground and hardened. They are used to \ufb01x the alignment of assembled components in dies, \ufb01xtures, and machinery. Taper pins possess a taper of 6.4 mm (0.25 in) per foot and are driven into the hole to establish a \ufb01xed relative position between the parts.Their advantage is that they can be driven readily back out of the hole. \rAdditional pin geometries are commercially available, including grooved pins\u2014 solid straight pins with three longitudinal grooves in which the metal is raised on either side of each groove to cause interference when the pin is pressed into a hole; knurled pins, pins with a knurled pattern that causes interference in the mating hole; and coiled pins, also called spiral pins, which are made by rolling strip stock into a coiled spring. \rShrink and Expansion Fits These terms refer to the assembly of two parts that have an interference \ufb01t at room temperature. The typical case is a cylindrical pin or shaft assembled into a collar. To assemble by shrink \ufb01 tting, the external part is heated to enlarge it by thermal expansion, and the internal part either remains at room temperature or is cooled to contract its size. The parts are then assembled and brought back to room temperature, so that the external part shrinks, and if previously cooled the internal part expands, to form a strong interference \ufb01t. An expansion \ufb01 t is when only the internal part is cooled to contract it for assembly; once inserted into the mating component, it warms to room temperature, expanding to create the interference assembly.These assembly methods are used to \ufb01t gears,pulleys,sleeves, and other components onto solid and hollow shafts. \rVarious methods are used to heat and/or cool the work parts. Heating equipment includes torches, furnaces, electric resistance heaters, and electric induction heaters. Cooling methods include conventional refrigeration, packing in dry ice, and immersion in cold liquids, including liquid nitrogen. The resulting change in diameter depends on the coef\ufb01cient of thermal expansion and the temperature difference that is applied to the part.

A snap \ufb01 t involves joining two parts in which the mating elements possess a temporary interference while being pressed together, but once assembled they interlock to maintain the assembly. A typical example is shown in Figure 31.13: as the parts are pressed together, the mating elements elastically deform to accommodate the interference, subsequently allowing the parts to snap together; once in position, the elements become connected mechanically so that they cannot easily be disassembled. The parts are usually designed so that a slight interference exists after assembly. \rAdvantages of snap \ufb01t assembly include (1) the parts can be designed with self-aligning features, (2) no special tooling is required, and (3) assembly can be accomplished very quickly. Snap \ufb01tting was originally conceived as a method that would be ideally suited to industrial robotics applications; however, it is no surprise that assembly techniques that are easier for robots are also easier for human assembly workers. \r\r\rFIGURE 31.14 \rRetaining ring assembled into a groove on ashaft. \rA retaining ring, also known as a snap ring, is a fastener that snaps into a circumferential groove on a shaft or tube to form a shoulder,as in Figure 31.14.The assembly can be used to locate or restrict the movement of parts mounted on the shaft.

These include stitching, stapling, sewing, and cotter pins. \rStitching, Stapling, and Sewing Industrial stitching and stapling are similar operations involving the use of U-shaped metal fasteners. Stitching is a fastening operation in which a stitching machine is used to form the U-shaped stitches one at a time from steel wire and immediately drive them through the two parts to be joined. Figure 31.15 illustrates several types of wire stitches. The parts to be joined must be relatively thin, consistent with the stitch size, and the assembly can involve various combinations of metal and nonmetal materials. Applications of industrial stitching include light sheet-metal assembly, metal hinges, electrical connections, magazine binding, corrugated boxes, and \ufb01nal product packaging. Conditions that favor stitching in these applications are (1) high-speed operation, (2) elimination of the need for prefabricated holes in the parts, and (3) desirability of using fasteners that encircle the parts. \rIn stapling, preformed U-shaped staples are punched through the two parts to be attached. The staples are supplied in convenient strips. The individual staples are lightly stuck together to form the strip, but they can be separated by the stapling tool for driving.The staples come with various point styles to facilitate their entry into the work. Staples are usually applied by means of portable pneumatic guns, into which strips containing several hundred staples can be loaded.Applications of industrial stapling include: furniture and upholstery, assembly of car seats, and various light-gage sheet-metal and plastic assembly jobs. \rSewing is a common joining method for soft, \ufb02 exible parts such as cloth and leather. The method involves the use of a long thread or cord interwoven with the \r\rFIGURE 31.15 \rCommon types of wirestitches: (a) unclinched,\r(b)\r standard loop,\r\r(c)\r bypass loop, and\r\r(d)\r \ufb02at clinch. \r\r\r\rFIGURE 31.16 \rCotter pins: (a) offsethead, standard point;\r(b)\r symmetric head,hammerlock point;\r\r(c)\r square point;\r\r(d)\r mitered point; and\r\r(e)\r chisel point. \r\r\r\rparts so as to produce a continuous seam between them.The process is widely used in the needle trades industry for assembling garments. \rCotter Pins Cotter pins are fasteners formed from half-round wire into a single two-stem pin, as in Figure 31.16.

Inserting a separate component is preferable to molding or casting its shape if the superior properties (e.g., strength) of the insert material are required, or the geometry achieved through the use of the insert is too complex or intricate to incorporate into the mold. Examples of inserts in molded or cast parts include internally threaded bushings and nuts, externally threaded studs, bearings, and electrical contacts. Some of these are illustrated in Figure 31.17. Internally threaded inserts must be placed into the mold with threaded pins to prevent the molding material from \ufb02owing into the threaded hole. \rPlacing inserts into a mold has certain disadvantages in production: (1) design of the mold becomes more complicated; (2) handling and placing the insert into the cavity takes time that reduces production rate; and (3) inserts introduce a foreign material into the casting or molding, and in the event of a defect, the cast metal or plastic cannot be easily reclaimed and recycled. Despite these disadvantages, use of inserts is often the most functional design and least-cost production method. \rIntegral Fasteners Integral fasteners involve deformation of component parts so they interlock and create a mechanically fastened joint. This assembly method is most common for sheet-metal parts. The possibilities, Figure 31.18, include (a) lanced tabs to attach wires or shafts to sheet-metal parts; (b) embossed protrusions, \rFIGURE 31.17 \rExamples of molded-ininserts: (a) threadedbushing, and\r(b) threaded stud. \r\r\rFIGURE 31.18 Integral fasteners: (a) lanced tabs to attach wires or shafts to sheetmetal, (b) embossed protrusions,similar to riveting, (c) single-lock seaming, (d) beading, and (e) dimpling.

The key to successful design for assembly can be simply stated [3]: (1) design the product with as few parts as possible, and (2) design the remaining parts so they are easy to assemble. The cost of assembly is determined largely during product design, because that is when the number of separate components in the product is determined, and decisions are made about how these components will be assembled. Once these decisions have been made, there is little that can be done in manufacturing to in\ufb02uence assembly costs (except, of course, to manage the operations well). \rThis section considers some of the principles that can be applied during product design to facilitate assembly.

Accordingly, our discussion is divided into two sections, the \ufb01rst dealing with general principles of DFA, and the second concerned speci\ufb01cally with design for automated assembly. \r31.6.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DFA \rMost of the general principles apply to both manual and automated assembly. Their goal is to achieve the required design function by the simplest and lowest cost means. The following recommendations have been compiled from [1], [3], [4], and [6]: \r\u27a2 \rUse the fewest number of parts possible to reduce the amount of assembly required. This principle is implemented by combining functions within the same part that might otherwise be accomplished by separate components (e.g., using a plastic molded part instead of an assembly of sheet metal parts). \r\r\u27a2 \rReduce the number of threaded fasteners required. Instead of using separate threaded fasteners, design the component to utilize snap \ufb01ts, retaining rings, integral fasteners, and similar fastening mechanisms that can be accomplished more rapidly. Use threaded fasteners only where justi\ufb01ed (e.g., where disassembly or adjustment is required). \r\r\u27a2 \rStandardize fasteners. This is intended to reduce the number of sizes and styles of fasteners required in the product. Ordering and inventory problems are reduced, the assembly worker does not have to distinguish between so many \r\r\rFIGURE 31.19 \rSymmetrical parts are generally easier to insert and assemble: \r(a) only one rotational orientation possible for insertion; (b) two possible orientations; (c) four possible orientations; and (d) in\ufb01nite rotational orientations. \r\r\rFIGURE 31.20 \r(a) Parts that tend to tangle, and (b) partsdesigned to avoidtangling. \rseparate fasteners, the workstation is simpli\ufb01ed, and the variety of separate fastening tools is reduced. \r\u27a2 \rReduce parts orientation dif\ufb01 culties . Orientation problems are generally reduced by designing a part to be symmetrical and minimizing the number of asymmetric features. This allows easier handling and insertion during assembly. This principle is illustrated in Figure 31.19. \r\r\u27a2 \rAvoid parts that tangle . Certain part con\ufb01gurations are more likely to become entangled in parts bins, frustrating assembly workers or jamming automatic feeders. Parts with hooks, holes, slots, and curls exhibit more of this tendency than parts without these features (see Figure 31.20). \r\r\r\r31.6.2 DESIGN FOR AUTOMATED ASSEMBLY \rMethods suitable for manual assembly are not necessarily the best methods for automated assembly. Some assembly operations readily performed by a human worker are quite dif\ufb01 cult to automate (e.g., assembly using bolts and nuts). To automate the assembly process, parts fastening methods must be speci\ufb01ed during product design that lend themselves to machine insertion and joining techniques and do not require the senses, dexterity, and intelligence of human assembly workers. Following are some recommendations and principles that can be applied in product design to facilitate automated assembly [6], [10]: \r\u27a2 \rUse modularity in product design . Increasing the number of separate tasks that are accomplished by an automated assembly system will reduce the reliability of the system.To alleviate the reliability problem,Riley [10] suggests that the design of the product be modular in which each module or subassembly has a maximum of 12 or 13 parts to be produced on a single assembly system. Also, the subassembly should be designed around a base part to which other components are added. \r\r\u27a2 \rReduce the need for multiple components to be handled at once . The preferred practice for automated assembly is to separate the operations at different stations rather than to simultaneously handle and fasten multiple components at the same workstation. \r\r\u27a2 \rLimit the required directions of access.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 35673, "end_char_idx": 40256, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef59c468-dabb-4e40-bd08-0dd20268f637": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef59c468-dabb-4e40-bd08-0dd20268f637", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec31.txt", "file_name": "sec31.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42808, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dfcd7046-730f-4b0f-b7e6-0f4d18deee45", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec31.txt", "file_name": "sec31.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42808, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "5ff4af92ef54a8fef6d5cd18b295ecf86df2f9077aaf89b48608fbd8123ca2d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba78a04c-e29d-4f99-8cd9-48af606de49e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec31.txt", "file_name": "sec31.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 42808, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4e37b1e24c88be50fc236927e84ce1c7eea999f0a56143c2569b248e4cb1a784", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Following are some recommendations and principles that can be applied in product design to facilitate automated assembly [6], [10]: \r\u27a2 \rUse modularity in product design .

They are technologies that have been adapted from conventional manufacturing and assembly operations or developed from scratch to serve special functions or needs in design and manufacturing. Rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing, covered in the present chapter, are a collection of processes used to fabricate parts directly from a computer-aided design (CAD) model. Chapters 33 and 34 discuss technologies used in electronics manufacturing, an activity of signi\ufb01cant economic importance. Chapter 33 covers integrated circuit processing, and Chapter 34 covers electronics assembly and packaging. Chapters 35 and 36 survey some of the technologies used to produce very small parts and products. Chapter 35 describes microfabrication technologies used to produce items measured in microns (106 m), whereas Chapter 36 discusses nanofabrication technologies for producing items measured in nanometers (109 m).The processes covered in these \ufb01ve chapters are relatively new. Rapid prototyping dates from about 1988. Modern electronics production techniques date from around 1960 (Historical Note 33.1), although dramatic advances have been made in electronics processing since that time. The microfabrication technologies discussed in Chapter 35 followed soon after integrated circuit processing. Finally, nanofabrication represents an emerging \ufb01eld today that dates from the 1990s. \r\rRapid prototyping (RP) is a family of technologies used to fabricate engineering prototypes of parts in minimum possible lead time based on a computer-aided design (CAD) model of the item. The traditional method of fabricating a prototype part is machining, which can require signi\ufb01cant lead times\u2014up to several weeks, sometimes longer, depending on part complexity, dif\ufb01culty in ordering materials, and scheduling production equipment. A number of rapid prototyping techniques are now available that allow a part to be produced in hours or days rather than weeks, given that a computer model of the part has been generated on a CAD system. \rAs the RP technologies have evolved, they are increasingly being used to produce parts, not just prototypes, and a more general term has emerged: Additive manufacturing (AM), which refers to the same technologies used in RP. All of these technologies work by adding layers of material to an existing part or substrate, so that the item is gradually built one layer at a time; hence the word \u201cadditive.\u201d One might say that rapid prototyping is a subset of additive manufacturing when the purpose is to fabricate a physical model of a newly designed part. Other terms often used synonymously with AM include direct digital manufac turing, rapid manufacturing, layer-based manufacturing, and solid free-form fabrication. A short history of rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing is presented in Historical Note 32.1. \rHistorical Note 32.1 Rapid Prototyping and Additive Manufacturing [4] \rIt should be noted that the historical development of rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing is based on several enabling technologies, including inte grated circuits, computers, in particular computer graphics and computer-aided design, lasers, ink-jet and other printing technologies, and highly accurate positioning systems, to name the most obvious. Without these enablers, RP and AM would not be technically feasible. \rThe beginnings of rapid prototyping as an identi\ufb01able technical area occurred in the mid-1980s when similar patents were \ufb01led by researchers in Japan, France, and the United States.

What these patent applications had in common was the idea of constructing a three-dimensional object by adding a seque nce of layers, one on top of the previous. The patent by Charles Hull is considered the most signi\ufb01 cant because it resulted in the commercial development of stereolithography (SL) and the formation of the company 3D Systems, Inc. SL users a laser beam to harden liquid photopolymers in a layer by layer construction process. \rSeveral additional patents followed in 1986 for Solid Ground Curing (SGC, Section 32.2.1); Selective Laser Sintering (SLS, Section 32.2.2); and Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM, Section 32.2.4). SGC exposed photopolymers through a physical mask; SLS used lasers to sinter or melt powder layers; and LOM cut paper sheets in the part building procedure. These systems were commercially introduced by three start-up companies, respectively, Cubital, DTM, and Helisys. DTM was the only survivor; it merged with 3D Systems in 2001. \rIn 1989, Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM, Section \r32.2.3) was patented, and the Stratasys Company was formed to commercialize the technology. FDM uses an extrusion process to add layers of material to an existing structure. In the same year, Three-Dimensional Printing (3DP, Section 32.2.2), which uses ink-jets to deposit droplets of a binder onto layers of powdered material, was patented by researchers at MIT. They licensed the technology to several companies for develop ment and commercialization. In 1994, a similar approach based on ink-jet technology was developed, \r\ronly it deposits the material itself to form layers rather of the RP and AM technologies used today through-than a binder on powder. out the world. Even SGC and LOM are used in altered The collection of processes discussed here, with forms, although the companies that originally developed re\ufb01nements over many years, constitute the majority them were unsuccessful. \r\r\r\rFundamentals of Rapid Prototyping and Additive Manufacturing \rThe special need that motivated the development of rapid prototyping is that product designers would like to have a physical model of a new part design rather than a computer model or line drawing. The creation of a prototype is an integral step in the design procedure. A virtual prototype, which is a computer model of the part design on a CAD system, may not be adequate for the designer to visualize the part. It certainly is not suf\ufb01cient to conduct real physical tests on the part, although it is possible to perform simulated tests by \ufb01nite element analysis or other methods. Using one of the available RP technologies, a solid physical part can be created in a relatively short time (hours if the company possesses the RP equipment or days if the part fabrication must be contracted to an outside \ufb01rm specializing in RP). The designer can therefore visually examine and physically feel the part and begin to perform tests and experiments to assess its merits and shortcomings. By speeding up the process of fabricating part prototypes, the duration of the entire product design cycle is reduced. \rAvailable prototyping technologies can be divided into two basic categories: \r(1) \rmaterial removal processes, and (2) material addition processes. The material removal RP alternative involves machining, primarily milling and drilling, using a dedicated Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine that is available to the design department on short notice. To use CNC, a part program must be prepared from the CAD model (Section 37.3.3). The starting material is often a solid block of wax, which is very easy to machine, and the part and chips can be melted and resolidi\ufb01 ed for reuse when the current prototype is no longer needed. Other starting materials can also be used, such as wood, plastics, or metals (e.g., a machinable grade of aluminum or brass). The CNC machines used for rapid prototyping are often small, and the terms desktop milling or desktop machining are sometimes used when referring to them. \r\rThe principal emphasis in this chapter is on material-addition technologies, all of which add thin layers of material one at a time to build the physical part from bottom to top.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3870, "end_char_idx": 8306, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e99340f-7116-4ec9-b3fb-ee944d9076c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e99340f-7116-4ec9-b3fb-ee944d9076c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec32.txt", "file_name": "sec32.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48358, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a4552745-1f0c-4822-8e43-78ac5604493e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec32.txt", "file_name": "sec32.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48358, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "dee93c6b1e4c25ed91a4ac6c7fe45b3067c5e1d9dcc77662ead05c1ce9107476", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b987146-9f49-4f94-be31-f8250e83c6ce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec32.txt", "file_name": "sec32.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48358, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "66bbb722cacd2b20fcd6e4611d38f50bbcc6ea108df4a04c312ccdbcd6aa6b80", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d418d9d0-7547-4db4-a21c-7cdb30fdb56c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "36fff85788e63deccf2e88b55719edb2b963bb834fcd8b4c91cff53ed139e1d7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "To use CNC, a part program must be prepared from the CAD model (Section 37.3.3).

Advantages of these technologies over CNC machining include [4]: \r\r(1) \rspeed of part delivery, as has already been mentioned; (2) avoidance of the CNC part programm ing task, because the CAD model is the part program in RP; and (3) complexity of part geometry is not an issue in additive manufacturing. Considering this last point, the AM time advantage increases with the complexity of the part geometry, because additive technologies operate the same whether the part is simple or complex, whereas CNC planning must include decisions about tooling, sequence, and access, and more machining is generally required for more complex parts. \r\r\r\r\r(a) (b) \rFIGURE 32.1 Conversion of a solid model of an object into layers (only one layer is shown). \rThe common approach to prepare the control instructions (i.e., part program) in \rall of the rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing technologies involves the \rfollowing steps [7]: \r1. \rGeometric modeling.This consists of modeling the component on a CAD system to de\ufb01ne its enclosed volume. Solid modeling is the preferred technique because it provides a complete and unambiguous mathematical representation of the geometry.The important issue is to distinguish the interior (mass) of the part from its exterior, and solid modeling provides for this distinction. \r\r2. \rTessellation of the geometric model.1 Inthisstep,theCADmodelisconvertedinto a format that approximates its surfaces by triangles, with their vertices arranged to distinguish the object\u2019s interior from its exterior. The common tessellation format used in rapid prototyping is STL2, which has become the de facto standard input format for nearly all RP systems. \r\r3. \rSlicing of the model into layers. In this step, the model in STL \ufb01le format is sliced into closely spaced parallel horizontal layers. Conversion of a solid model into layers is illustrated in Figure 32.1.These layers are subsequently used by the RP system to construct the physical model. By convention, the layers are formed in the x-y plane, and the layering procedure occurs in the z-axis direction. For each layer, a curing path is generated, called the STI \ufb01le, which is the path that will be followed by the RP system to cure (or otherwise solidify) the layer. \r\r\rStarting material forms in additive manufacturing include (1) liquid polymers that are cured layer by layer into solid polymers, (2) powders that are aggregated and bonded layer by layer, (3) molten materials that are solidi\ufb01ed layer by layer, and (4) solid sheets that are laminated to create the solid part. Material types include wax, polymers, metals, and ceramics. \r1 More generally, the term tessellation refers to the laying out or creation of a mosaic, such as one consisting of small colored tiles af\ufb01xed to a surface for decoration. 2 STL stands for STereoLithography, one of the primary systems used for rapid prototyping, developed by 3D Systems, Inc. \rv v y\ry\ry \rFIGURE 32.2 The three basic layerconstruction modes: \r\r(a) point or spot mode, xx \rx \r\r(b) moving line mode, \r(a) (b) (c)\rand (c) layer mode. \rIn addition to starting material, there are various layer-forming processes by which each layer is created to build the part.

It is one of the most widely used additive manufacturing methods. Stereolithography (SL) is a process for fabricating a solid plastic part out of a photosensitive liquid polymer using a directed laser beam to solidify the polymer. The general setup for the process is illustrated in Figure 32.3. Part fabrication is accomplished as a series of layers, in which one layer is added onto the previous layer to gradually build the desired three-dimensional geometry.

When the initial layer is completed, the platform is lowered by a distance equal to the layer thickness, and a second layer is formed on top of the \ufb01rst by the laser, and so on. Before each new layer is cured, a recoating blade is passed over the viscous liquid resin to ensure that its level is the same throughout the surface. Each layer consists of its own area shape, so that the succession of layers, one on top of the previous,creates the solid part shape.Typical layer thickness is 0.05 to \r0.15 mm (0.002\u20130.006 in). Thinner layers provide better resolution and allow more intricate part shapes;but processing times are longer.Typical liquid photopolymers include acrylic and epoxy, which are cured upon exposure to an ultraviolet laser. After all of the layers have been formed, excess polymer is removed, and light sanding is sometimes used to improve smoothness and appearance. \rDepending on its design and orientation, a part may contain overhanging features that have no means of support during the bottom-up approach used in stereolithography. For example, in Figure 32.1, if the lower half of the handle and the lower handlebar were eliminated, the upper portion of the handle would be unsupported during fabrication. In these cases, extra pillars or webs may need to be added to the part simply for support purposes. Otherwise, the overhangs may \ufb02oat away or otherwise distort the desired part geometry. These extra features must be trimmed away after the process is completed. \rMask Projection Stereolithography Conventional stereolithography described above uses a single moving laser beam to cure the photopolymer in a given layer.As mentioned, this can be quite time consuming. In mask projection stereolithography (MPSL), the entire layer of liquid photopolymer is exposed at once to an ultraviolet light source through a mask instead of using a scanning laser beam. The hardening process for each layer in MPSL is therefore much shorter than conventional SL. \rThe key to MPSL is the use of a dynamic mask that is digitally altered for each layer by any of several proprietary technologies such as the digital micromirror deviceTM (DMD), a product of Texas Instruments [14].

Two important AM processes in this category are (1) selective laser sintering and (2) three-dimensional printing. \rSelective Laser Sintering Selective laser sintering (SLS) uses a moving laser beam to fuse powders in areas corresponding to the CAD geometric model one layer at a time to build the solid part. After each layer is completed, a new layer of loose powders is spread across the surface and leveled using a counter-rotating roller. The powders are preheated to just below their melting point to facilitate \r3 It is of interest to note that the precursor of MPSL was developed in 1986 called Solid Ground Curing (SGC, Historical Note 32.1). SGC was ultimately unsuccessful because it used a physical mask rather than a dynamic mask as in MPSL. A new mask had to be fabricated for each new layer in SGC, which made the technology uncompetitive compared with other RP and AM technologies. 4 The de\ufb01 nition, characteristics, and production of powders are described in Chapters 15 and 16. \rbonding and reduce distortion of the \ufb01nished product. Preheating also serves to reduce power requirements of the laser. Layer by layer, the powders are gradually bonded into a solid mass that forms the three-dimensional part geometry. In areas not sintered by the laser beam, the powders remain loose so they can be poured out of the completed part. Meanwhile, they serve to support the solid regions of the part as fabrication proceeds. Layer thickness is 0.075 to 0.50 mm (0.003\u20130.020 in). The SLS process is usually accomplished in an enclosure that is \ufb01lled with nitrogen to minimize degradation of powders that might be susceptible to oxidation (e.g., metals). \rSLS was developed by Carl Deckard at the University of Texas (Austin) as an alternative to stereolithography, and SLS machines were originally marketed by DTM Corporation, a company founded by Deckard and two partners [9].5 It is a more versatile process than stereolithography in terms of possible work materials. Whereas SL is limited to liquid photopolymers, selective laser sintering materials include polymers, metals, and ceramics, which are generally less expensive than photosensitive resins. \rAs mentioned, SLS is a Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) process. Other PBF technologies differ from SLS in the following ways: (1) heating or fusion techniques, (2) methods for handling the powders, and (3) mechanisms by which the powders are bonded into solid objects. For example, one alternative process uses an electron beam as the heating source to melt the powders; it is called electron beam melting (EBM). Other variations include the use of line-wise and layer-wise processes as opposed to the point-wise process in selective laser sintering. \rThree-Dimensional Printing This technology (3DP) builds the part using an ink-jet printer to eject adhesive bonding material onto successive layers of powders. The binder is deposited in areas corresponding to the cross sections of the solid part, as determined by slicing the CAD geometric model into layers. The binder holds the powders together to form the solid part, whereas the unbonded powders remain loose to be removed later. While the loose powders are in place during the build process, they serve to support overhanging and fragile features of the part. When the build process is complete, the loose powders are removed. To further strengthen the part, a sintering step can be applied to bond the individual powders. \rThe part is built on a platform whose level is controlled by a piston.

Typical layer thickness ranges from about 0.10 to 0.20 mm (0.004\u20130.008 in). The ink-jet printing head moves across the layer at a speed of about 1.5 m/sec (59 in/sec), with ejection of liquid binder determined duringthe sweep by raster scanning.Thesweep time,together with the spreading of the powders, permits a cycle time per layer of about 2 seconds [19]. Allowing for repositioning and recoating delays, this permits the machine to operate at a rate of two to four layers per minute [4]. \r5 The initials DTM stand for desktop manufacturing [9].

Although the material is molten just before deposition, it must be in a solid or semisolid state immediately after it is deposited  to maintain the desired shape. As a practical matter, the melting requirement limits the materials that can be used with these systems to thermoplastic polymers or wax. Two representative systems are described below: (1) fused deposition modeling, which uses an extrusion head to dispense the material; and (2) droplet deposition manufacturing, which uses a multichannel printing head. \rFused-Deposition Modeling Fused-deposition modeling (FDM) is an RP process in which a \ufb01 lament of wax and/or thermoplastic polymer is extruded onto the exist ing part surface from a work head to complete each new layer. The work head is controlled in the x-y plane during each layer and then moved up by a distance equal to one layer in the z-direction. The starting material is a solid \ufb01 lament with typical diameter  1.25 mm (0.050 in) fed from a spool into the work head, which heats the material to about 0.5\u00b0C (~1\u00b0F) above its melting point before extruding it onto the part surface. The extrudate is solidi\ufb01 ed and cold welded to the cooler part surface in about 0.1 sec. If a support structure is needed, that material is usually extruded by a second extrusion head using a different material that can be readily separated from the main part. The part is fabricated from the base up, using a layer-by-layer procedure similar to other RP systems. A disadvantage of FDM is its relatively slow speed, because the deposited material is applied in a moving-point channel mode, and the work head cannot be moved with the high speed of a laser spot. Also, the use of an extruder, with its circular nozzle ori\ufb01 ce, makes it dif\ufb01 cult to form sharp corners [4].", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 21472, "end_char_idx": 25516, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "934b0a55-3dc0-41a3-96b9-0dea17c06d07": {"__data__": {"id_": "934b0a55-3dc0-41a3-96b9-0dea17c06d07", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec32.txt", "file_name": "sec32.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48358, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a4552745-1f0c-4822-8e43-78ac5604493e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec32.txt", "file_name": "sec32.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48358, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "dee93c6b1e4c25ed91a4ac6c7fe45b3067c5e1d9dcc77662ead05c1ce9107476", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad47813b-4467-41f2-8d1a-3fae542a3bae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec32.txt", "file_name": "sec32.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 48358, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "b9aaf3e59ad3e64bbaa400009db6afd587320fa55a1ecf6bff8a7cd574a48665", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "19828083-3383-4a8c-b6f6-b4d31adeb40f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fbe6bfbe37fb765bc581a73f480fcaf1f7eb0f9581c1684de9cf9e259b40b632", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The extrudate is solidi\ufb01 ed and cold welded to the cooler part surface in about 0.1 sec.

The slice (layer) thickness is typically set from 0.25 to 0.33 mm (0.01\u20130.013 in), but for \ufb01ner details, layer thickness can be set to a minimum of 0.076 mm (0.003 in) [4]. Up to about 400 mm of \ufb01 lament can be deposited per second by the extrusion work head. Starting materials are wax and several polymers, including ABS and polycarbonate. These materials are nontoxic, allowing the FDM machine to be set up in an of\ufb01ce environment. A collection of plastic parts made by fused deposition modeling is shown in Figure 32.7, and the FDM machine that made these parts is shown in Figure 32.8. \rDroplet Deposition Manufacturing This process, also known as ballistic-particle manufacturing, operates by melting the starting material and shooting small droplets onto a previously formed layer. The term droplet deposition manufacturing (DDM) refers to the fact that small particles of work material are deposited as projectile droplets from the work head nozzle. The liquid droplets cold weld to the surface to form a new layer. The deposition of droplets for each new layer is controlled by a moving x-y work head that operates in a point-wise manner, in which the path is based on a cross section of a CAD geometric model that has been sliced into layers. For geometries that require a support structure, two work heads are used, one to dispense the polymer to make the object itself, and the second to deposit another material for the support. After each layer has been applied, the platform supporting the part is lowered a certain distance corresponding to the layer thickness, in preparation for the next layer. \rSeveral commercial additive manufacturing machines are based on this general operating principle, the differences being in the type of material that is deposited \r\rFIGURE 32.8 Fused deposition modelingmachine.

An important criterion that must be satis\ufb01ed by the starting material is that it be readily melted and solidi\ufb01ed. Work materials used in DDM include wax and thermoplastics.

In this section a solid-sheet system called laminated-object manufacturing is discussed. Differences among commercial products in this category include materials out of which the sheets are made and methods of assembling the sheets. \rLaminated-Object Manufacturing Laminated-object manufacturing (LOM) produces a solid physical model by stacking layers of sheet stock that are each cut to an outline corresponding to the cross-sectional shape of a CAD model that has been sliced into layers. The layers are sequentially stacked and bonded one on top of the previous one to build the part. After cutting, the excess material in each layer remains in place to support the part during building. Starting materials in LOM include paper, cardboard, and plastic in sheet stock form. Stock thickness is 0.05 to 0.50 mm (0.002\u20130.020 in). In LOM, the sheet material is usually supplied with adhesive backing as rolls that are spooled between two reels, as in Figure 32.9. Otherwise, the LOM process must include an adhesive coating step for each layer. \rThe data preparation phase in LOM consists of slicing the geometric model using the STL \ufb01 le for the given part. With reference to Figure 32.9, the LOM process for each layer can be described as follows, picking up the action with a sheet of stock in place and bonded to the previous stack:(1)The cross-sectional perimeter of the STL model is computed based on the measured height of the physical part at the current layer of completion. The slicing function in LOM is performed after each layer has been physically added and the vertical height of the part has been measured. This provides a feedback correction to account for the actual thickness of the sheet stock being used, a feature unavailable on most other RP systems. (2) A laser beam is used to cut along the perimeter, as well as to crosshatch the surplus portions of the sheet for subsequent removal. The cutting trajectory is controlled by means of an x-y positioning system, and cutting depth is controlled so that only the top layer is cut. \r(3) The platform holding the stack is lowered, and the sheet stock is advanced between supply roll and take-up spool for the next layer. The platform is then raised to a height consistent with the stock thickness, and a heated roller moves across the new layer to bond it to the previous layer. The height of the physical stack is measured in preparation for the next slicing computation. \rWhen all of the layers are completed, the new part is separated from the excess external material. The part can then be sanded to smooth and blend the layered edges. A sealing application is recommended, at least for paper and cardboard stock to prevent moisture absorption and damage, using a urethane, epoxy, or other polymer spray. LOM part sizes can be relatively large among AM processes, with work volumes up to 800 mm  500 mm by 550 mm (32 in  20 in # 22 in). More common work volumes are 380 mm  250 mm  350 mm (15 in  10 in  14 in). \r\r\rThus, one of the advantages of LOM compared to other RP and AM technologies is the capability to build parts that are quite large. \rThe original company offering LOM systems was Helisys, Inc.

The purpose of this section is to develop mathematical models of this layer-by-layer approach to determine cycle time and part cost. \rCycle Time Analysis The cycle time to build a part by the layering processes in additive manufacturing depends on the size of the part (volume of material in the part) and the number of parts produced in one build cycle. It also depends on the layer formation processes (e.g., lasers, droplet-based, extruder) and the associated channel mode (moving spot, moving line, or layer). Associated process parameters include layer thickness (thinner layers mean more layers and slower cycle time for the same part size), the speed with which the moving spot or moving line travels, and any delays that are inherent in the process, such as repositioning and recoating. The modeling approach used here for estimating build time is to determine the time to complete each layer and then sum up the layer times to obtain the overall cycle time. An alternative and more detailed approach is described in Gibson et al [4]. \rFirst, the time to complete a single layer in processes that use a moving-spot channel mode is given by the following equation: \rAi\rTi $ Tr (32.1) \rvD \r\rwhere Ti  time to complete layer i, s (sec), where the subscript i is used to identify the layer; Ai  area of layer i, mm2 (in2); v \" speed of the moving spot on the surface, mm/s (in/sec); D  diameter of the spot (assumed circular), mm (in); and Tr \" repositioning and recoating time between layers, s (sec). Repositioning time involves lowering the worktable to prepare for the next layer to be fabricated. It also includes repositioning of the work head at the beginning and end of a layer if that is not performed in parallel with table repositioning. Recoating time is the time to spread material for the new layer; for example, to spread the next layer of powders. Recoating time is not applicable in all AM processes. Tr may also include built-in delays associated with each layer, such as cooling or heating delays, and nozzle cleaning. \rOnce the Ti values have been determined for all layers, then the build cycle time can be determined as the sum of these times plus any setup or start-up time required for the process. For example, the machine may require a warm-up period during which the chamber is brought up to a speci\ufb01ed temperature. It may also be desirable to include the time for the operator to load the starting material and perform any setup tasks that are associated with the production run. The total cycle time is given by the following: \r\rnl \rTc \" Tsu Ti (32.2)\ri=1 \rwhere Tc \" build cycle time, s (sec); Tsu \" setup time, s (sec); and nl \" number of layers used to approximate the part. \rThe square cup-shaped part shown in Figure 32.10 is to be fabricated using stereolithography. The base of the cup is 40 mm on each side and is 5 mm thick. The walls are 4 mm thick, and the total height of the cup  52 mm.

The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of the problems encountered in additive manufacturing. \r\rDesign This was the initial application area for rapid prototyping systems. Designers are able to con\ufb01rm their design by building a real physical model in minimum time using rapid prototyping. The features and functions of the part can be communicated to others more easily using a physical model than by a paper drawing or displaying it on a CAD system monitor. Design bene\ufb01ts attributed to rapid prototyping include [2]: \r\r(1) \rreduced lead times to produce prototype components, (2) improved ability to visualize the part geometry because of its physical existence, (3) earlier detection and reduction of design errors, and (4) increased capability to compute mass properties of components and assemblies. \r\rEngineering Analysis and Planning The existence of an RP-fabricated part allows for certain types of engineering analysis and planning activities to be accomplished that would be more dif\ufb01cult without the physical entity. Some of the possibilities are \r\r(1) \rcomparison of different shapes and styles to optimize aesthetic appeal of the part; \r\r(2) \ranalysis of \ufb02 uid \ufb02 ow through different ori\ufb01 ce designs in valves fabricated by RP; \r\r(3) \rwind tunnel testing of different streamline shapes using physical models created by RP; (4) stress analysis of a physical model; (5) fabrication of preproduction parts as an aid in process planning and tool design; and (6) combining medical imaging technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging, with RP to create models for doctors in planning surgical procedures or fabricating prostheses or implants. \r\r\rTooling When AM is adopted to fabricate production tooling, the term rapid tool making (RTM) is often used. RTM applications divide into two approaches [5]: indirect RTM method, in which a pattern is created by RP and the pattern is used to fabricate the tool, and direct RTM method, in which RP is used to make the tool itself.

Examples of customized parts are found in medical applications such as bone replacements, hearing aid shells that must be \ufb01tted to an individual\u2019s ear, dental aligners (clear dental braces that gradually correct a patient\u2019s bite), and custom soccer shoes for professional athletes. \rAs the preceding examples illustrate, direct digital manufacturing is not a substitute for mass production. Instead, it is appropriate for low-volume production and mass customization, in which products are made in large numbers but each product is somehow unique. To generalize, the characteristics of production situations suited to additive manufacturing include the following [4]: (1) unique geometries, (2) complex shapes, (3) low quantities, even quantities of one, (4) quick turnaround, and (5) it is desirable to avoid the fabrication of special hard tooling. The requirement is that a CAD model of the item must be available. \rProblems with Additive Manufacturing The principal problems with current AM processes include (1) part accuracy, (2) limited variety of materials, and (3) mechanical performance of the fabricated parts. \rSeveral sources of error limit part accuracy in AM systems: (1) mathematical, \r(2) process related, or (3) material related [19]. Mathematical errors include approximations of part surfaces used in RP data preparation and differences between the slicing thicknesses and actual layer thicknesses in the physical part.The latter differences result in z-axis dimensional errors. An inherent limitation in the physical part is the steps between layers, especially as layer thickness is increased, resulting in a staircase appearance for sloping part surfaces. Process-related errors sometimes result from the particular part building technology used in the AM system. These errors degrade the shape of each layer as well as the registration between adjacent layers. Process errors can also affect the z-axis dimension. Finally, material-related errors include shrinkage and distortion. An allowance for shrinkage can be made by enlarging the CAD model of the part based on previous experience with the process and materials. \rCurrent rapid prototyping systems are limited in the variety of materials they can process. For example, stereolithography is limited to photosensitive polymers. In general, the materials used in AM systems are not as strong as the production part materials that will be used in the actual product. This limits the mechanical performance of the prototypes and the amount of realistic testing that can be done to verify the design during product development.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 43729, "end_char_idx": 48197, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b7be40a-a5b2-4614-a247-d68b6c9840ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b7be40a-a5b2-4614-a247-d68b6c9840ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec33.txt", "file_name": "sec33.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79761, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a618bec8-5017-490b-867b-dc33f36fb259", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec33.txt", "file_name": "sec33.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79761, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "55af42749f7d2edd862a64cb957f376c7b546b5e9133f579b88bb8cd2c7cf66c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2b889324-40a9-43df-8426-d2cfc08578f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1b975eda8becf04034ffc667fee14ff2af3e0f5ea54dfa4cf01c12573550a05", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Processing of IntegratedCircuits \rChapter Contents \r33.1 Overview of IC Processing \r33.1.1 Processing Sequence \r33.1.2 Clean Rooms \r\r\r33.2 Silicon Processing \r33.2.1 Production of Electronic Grade Silicon \r33.2.2 Crystal Growing \r33.2.3 Shaping of Silicon into Wafers \r\r\r33.3 Lithography \r\r33.3.1 Optical Lithography \r33.3.2 Other Lithography Techniques \r\r\r33.4 Layer Processes Used in IC Fabrication \r33.4.1 Thermal Oxidation \r33.4.2 Chemical Vapor Deposition \r33.4.3 Introduction of Impurities into Silicon \r33.4.4 Metallization \r33.4.5 Etching \r\r\r\r33.5 Integrating the Fabrication Steps \r33.6 IC Packaging \r\r33.6.1 IC Package Design \r33.6.2 Processing Steps in IC Packaging \r\r\r33.7 Yields in IC Processing \rAn integrated circuit (IC) is a collection of electronic devices such as transistors, diodes, and resistors that have been fabricated and electrically interconnected onto a small \ufb02at chip of semiconductor material. Silicon (Si) is the most widely used semiconductor material for ICs, because of its combination of properties and low cost. Less common semiconductor chips are made of gallium arsenide (GaAs) and germanium (Ge). Because the circuits are fabricated into one solid piece of material, the term solid-state electronics is used to denote these devices. Semiconductor devices such as integrated circuits are the basis for virtually all modern electronics products, which constitute the world\u2019s largest industry, overtaking the automobile industry in gross sales in 1998 [15]. \rThe IC was invented in 1959 and has been the subject of continual development ever since (Historical Note 33.1). The most fascinating aspect of microelectronics technology is the huge number of devices that can be packed onto a single small chip. Various terms have been developed to de\ufb01ne the level of integration and density of packing, such as large-scale integration (LSI) and very-large-scale integration (VLSI). Table 33.1 lists these terms, their de\ufb01nitions (although there is not complete agreement over the dividing lines between levels), and the period during which the technology was introduced. In 1975, Gordon Moore1 formulated what has come to be known as Moore\u2019s law, which states that the number of transistors (the building blocks of logic and memory devices) on an integrated circuit doubles every 2 years [23]. The predictive ability of this law has remained accurate to the present time. Today\u2019s gigascale technology is capable of fabricating millions of transistors per square millimeter of processable area on the chip surface. \r1Gordon Moore was a cofounder of Intel Corporation, and at time of writing, is the company\u2019s Chairman Emeritus. \r\r\rRecent advances in semiconductor technology include system-on-chip and three-dimensional integrated circuits [21]. System-on-chip refers to the fabrication of an integrated circuit that contains all of the components required in a computer. Conventional computers include multiple integrated circuits and other components that are interconnected on a printed circuit board (Chapter 34). The system-on-chip concept minimizes assembly costs and power requirements for the computer. A three-dimensional integrated circuit is an IC consisting of components that have both vertical and horizontal features,enabling faster operation because the average conduction distance between components is reduced compared with a two-dimensional layer with the same number of components. Intel Corporation\u2019s Tri-Gate technology uses 3-D transistors with vertical \ufb01ns that project upward from the silicon chip surface, enabling switching speeds to be increased and power requirements to be reduced. \rHistorical Note 33.1 Integrated circuit technology \rThe history of integrated circuits includes inventions of electronic devices and the processes for making these devices.

Owing to the importance of radar in the war, commercial sources of germanium and silicon were developed. \rIn 1947, the transistor was developed at the Bell Telephone Laboratories by J.

These three inventors shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for their research on semiconductors and the discovery of the transistor. The interest of the Bell Labs was to develop electronic switching systems that were more reliable than the electromechanical relays and vacuum tubes used at that time. \rIn February 1959, J. Kilby of Texas Instruments Inc. \ufb01 led a patent application for the fabrication of multiple electronic devices and their interconnection to form a circuit on a single piece of semiconductor material. Kilby was describing an integrated circuit (IC). In May 1959, \rJ. Hoerni of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. applied for a patent describing the planar process for fabricating transistors. In July of the same year, R. Noyce also of Fairchild \ufb01led a patent application similar to the Kilby inven tion but specifying the use of planar technology and adherent leads. \rAlthough \ufb01 led later than Kilby\u2019s, Noyce\u2019s patent was issued \ufb01 rst, in 1961 (the Kilby patent was awarded in 1964). This discrepancy in dates and similarity in inventions have resulted in considerable controversy over who was really the inventor of the IC. The issue was argued in legal suits stretching all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court refused to hear the case, leaving stand a lower court ruling that favored several of Noyce\u2019s claims. The result (at the risk of oversimplifying) is that Kilby is generally credited with the concept of the monolithic integrated circuit, whereas Noyce is credited with the method for fabricating it. \rThe \ufb01rst commercial ICs were introduced by Texas Instruments in March 1960. Early integrated circuits contained about 10 devices on a small silicon chip\u2014about 3 mm (0.12 in) square. By 1966, silicon had overtaken germanium as the preferred semiconductor material. Since that year, Si has been the predominant material in IC fabrication. Since the 1960s, a continual trend toward miniaturization and increased integration of multiple devices in a single chip has occurred in the electronics industry (the progress can be seen in Table 33.1), leading to the components described in this chapter. \r\r\r150 nm \r\rGate \rFIGURE 33.1 Cross section Phosphosilicate\rglass (P-glass)\rof a transistor (speci\ufb01cally, a MOSFET) in an integrated \rSilicon dioxide \rcircuit.

The devices are electrically connected to one another by very \ufb01ne lines of conducting material, so that the interconnected devices (that is, the integrated circuit) function in the speci\ufb01ed way. Conducting lines and pads are also provided to electrically connect the IC to leads, which in turn permit the IC to be connected to external circuits. MOSFET is the most important device technology for ultra large scale integration [15]. \rTo connect the IC to the outside world, and to protect it from damage, the chip is \rattached to a lead frame and encapsulated inside a suitable package, as in Figure 33.2. \rThe package is an enclosure, usually made of plastic or ceramic, which provides \rFIGURE 33.2 \rPackaging of anintegrated circuit chip:\r(a) cutaway viewshowing the chipattached to a lead frame and encapsulated in a plastic enclosure,and (b) the packageas it would appear toa user.

The leads are attached to conducting pads on the chip that access the IC. \r33.1.1 PROCESSING SEQUENCE \rThe sequence to fabricate a silicon-based IC chip begins with the processing of silicon (Section 7.5.2). Brie\ufb02y, silicon of very high purity is reduced in several steps from sand (silicon dioxide,SiO2).The silicon is grown from a melt into a large solid single-crystal log, with typical length of 1 to 3 m (3\u201310 ft) and diameter up to 450 mm (18 in). The log, called a boule, is then sliced into thin wafers, which are disks of thickness equal to about 0.5 mm (0.020 in). \rAfter suitable \ufb01nishing and cleaning, the wafers are ready for the sequence of processes by which microscopic features of various chemistries will be created in their surface to form the electronic devices and their interconnections. The sequence consists of several types of processes, most of them repeated many times. A total of 200 or more processing steps may be required to produce a modern IC. Basically, the objective in the sequence is to add, alter, or remove a layer of material in selected regions of the wafer surface. The layering steps in IC fabrication are sometimes referred to as the planar process, because the processing relies on the geometric form of the silicon wafer being a plane.The processes by which the layers are added include thin \ufb01lm deposition techniques such as physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition (Section 27.5), and existing layers are altered by diffusion and ion implantation (Section 27.2).

Additional layer-forming techniques, such as thermal oxidation, are also employed. Layers are removed in selected regions by etching, using chemical etchants (usually acid solutions) and other more advanced technologies such as plasma etching. \rThe addition, alteration, and removal of layers must be done selectively; that is, only in certain extremely small regions of the wafer surface to create the device details such as in Figure 33.1. To distinguish which regions will be affected in each processing step, a procedure involving lithography is used. In this technique, masks are formed on the surface to protect certain areas and allow other areas to be exposed to the particular process (e.g., \ufb01lm deposition, etching). By repeating the steps many times, exposing different areas in each step, the starting silicon wafer is gradually transformed into many integrated circuits. \rProcessing of the wafer is organized in such a way that many individual chip surfaces are formed on a single wafer. Because the wafer is round with diameters ranging from 150 to 450 mm (6 to 18 in), whereas the \ufb01nal chip may only be 12 mm (0.5 in) square, it is possible to produce hundreds of chips on a single wafer. At the conclusion of planar processing, each IC on the wafer is visually and functionally tested, the wafer is cut into individual chips, and each chip that passes the quality test is packaged as in Figure 33.2. \rSummarizing the preceding discussion, the production of silicon-based integrated circuits consists of the following stages, portrayed in Figure 33.3: (1) Silicon processing, in which sand is reduced to very pure silicon and then shaped into wafers; \r(2) IC fabrication, consisting of multiple processing steps that add, alter, and remove thin layers in selected regions to form the electronic devices; lithography is used to de\ufb01 ne the regions to be processed on the surface of the wafer; and (3) IC packaging, in which the wafer is tested, cut into individual dies (IC chips), and the dies are encapsulated in an appropriate package. Subsequent sections of the chapter are concerned with the details of these processing stages. Before beginning the coverage of the processing details, it is important to note that the microscopic dimensions of the devices in integrated circuits impose special requirements on the environment in which IC fabrication is accomplished. \r\r\r33.1.2 CLEAN ROOMS \rMuch of the processing sequence for integrated circuits must be carried out in a clean room, the ambiance of which is more like a hospital operating room than a production factory. Cleanliness is dictated by the microscopic feature sizes in an IC, the scale of which continues to decrease with each passing year. Figure 33.4 shows the trend in IC device feature size; also displayed are common airborne particles that are potential contaminants in IC processing. These particles can cause defects in the integrated circuits, reducing yields and increasing costs. \rA clean room provides protection from these contaminants. The air is puri\ufb01ed to remove most of the particles from the processing environment; temperature and humidity are also controlled.The clean room is air conditioned to a temperature of 21\u00b0C (70\u00b0F) and 45% relative humidity. The air is passed through a high-ef\ufb01ciency particulate air (HEPA) \ufb01lter to capture particle contaminants. Several classi\ufb01 cation systems are used to specify the cleanliness of a clean room. Two are outlined here: ISO and US [18]. In both systems, a number is used to indicate the number of particles of size 0.5 mm or greater in a speci\ufb01ed volume of air.

By comparison, outside air in a typical urban atmosphere contains 35,000,000 particles/m3 or 1,000,000 particles/ft3 of size equal to or greater than 0.5 mm [18]. \rHumans are the biggest source of contaminants in IC processing; emanating from humans are bacteria, tobacco smoke, viruses, hair, and other particles. Human workers in IC processing areas are required to wear special clothing, generally consisting of white cloaks, gloves, and hair nets. Where extreme cleanliness is required, workers are completely encased in bunny suits. Processing equipment is a second major source of contaminants; machinery produces wear particles, oil, dirt, and similar contaminants. IC processing is usually accomplished in laminar-\ufb02ow hooded work areas, which can be puri\ufb01ed to greater levels of cleanliness than the general environment of the clean room. \rIn addition to the very pure atmosphere provided by the clean room, the chemicals and water used in IC processing must be very clean and free of particles. Modern practice requires that chemicals and water be \ufb01ltered before using them. \r\r\r\rSilicon Processing \rMicroelectronic chips are fabricated on a substrate of semiconductor material. Silicon (Si) is the leading semiconductor material today, constituting more than 95% of all semiconductor devices produced in the world. The discussion in this introductory treatment is limited to Si. The preparation of the silicon substrate can be divided into three steps: (1) production of electronic grade silicon, (2) crystal growing, and (3) shaping of Si into wafers. \rSection 33.2/Silicon Processing  875  \r33.2.1  PRODUCTION OF ELECTRONIC GRADE SILICON  \rSilicon is one of the most abundant materials in the Earth\u2019s crust (Table 7.1), occurring naturally as silica (e.g., sand) and silicates (e.g., clay).

They cannot be measured by conventional chemical laboratory techniques but must be inferred from measurements of resistivity on test ingots. The reduction of the naturally occurring Si compound to EGS involves the following processing steps. The \ufb01rst step is carried out in a submerged-electrode arc furnace. The principal raw material for silicon is quartzite, which is very pure SiO2.The charge also includes coal, coke, and wood chips as sources of carbon for the various chemical reactions that occur in the furnace. The net product consists of metallurgical grade silicon (MGS), and the gases SiO and CO. MGS is only about 98% Si, which is adequate for metallurgical alloying but not for electronics components. The major impurities (the remaining 2% of MGS) include aluminum, calcium, carbon, iron, and titanium. The second step involves grinding the brittle MGS and reacting the Si powders with anhydrous HCl to form trichlorsilane:  \rSi  3HCl (gas) \u2192 SiHCl3 (gas)  H2 (gas)  (33.1)  \rThe reaction is performed in a \ufb02uidized-bed reactor at temperatures around 300\u00b0C (~570\u00b0F). Trichlorsilane (SiHCl3), although shown as a gas in Equation (33.1), is a liquid at room temperature. Its low boiling point of 32\u00b0C (90\u00b0F) permits it to be separated from the leftover impurities of MGS by fractional distillation. The \ufb01nal step in the process is reduction of the puri\ufb01ed trichlorsilane by means of hydrogen gas. The process is carried out at temperatures up to 1000\u00b0C (~1800\u00b0F), and a simpli\ufb01ed equation of the reaction can be written as follows:  \rSiHCl3 (gas)  H2 (gas) \u2192 Si  3HCl (gas)  (33.2)  \rThe product of this reaction is electronic grade silicon\u2014nearly 100% pure Si.  \r33.2.2  CRYSTAL GROWING  \r\rThe silicon substrate for microelectronic chips must be made of a single crystal whose unit cell is oriented in a certain direction. The properties of the substrate and the way it is processed are both in\ufb02uenced by these requirements. Accordingly, silicon used as the raw material in semiconductor device fabrication must not only be of ultra high purity, as in electronic grade silicon; it must also be prepared in the form of a single crystal and then cut in a direction that achieves the desired planar orientation.The crystal-growing process is covered here,and the next section details the cutting operation. \rThe most widely used crystal-growing method in the semiconductor industry is the Czochralski process, illustrated in Figure 33.5, in which a single crystal ingot, called a boule, is pulled upward from a pool of molten silicon.4 The setup includes a furnace, a mechanical apparatus for pulling the boule, a vacuum system, and \r4The process is named after J.

Heating is by induction or resistance, the latter being used for large melt sizes. The molten silicon is doped5 before pulling begins to make the crystal either p-type or n-type. \rTo initiate crystal growing, a seed crystal of silicon is dipped into the molten pool and then withdrawn upward under carefully controlled conditions. At \ufb01rst the pulling rate (vertical velocity of the pulling apparatus) is relatively rapid, which causes a single crystal of silicon to solidify against the seed,forming a thin neck.The velocity is then reduced, causing the neck to grow into the desired larger diameter of the boule while maintaining its single crystal structure. In addition to pulling rate, rotation of the crucible and other process parameters are used to control boule size. Single-crystal ingots of diameter ! 450 mm (18 in) and up to 3 m (10 ft) long can be produced for subsequent fabrication of microelectronic chips. \r5 The term dope (doped, doping) refers to the introduction of impurities into the semiconductor material to alter its electrical properties, making the semiconductor either an n-type (excess electrons in its structure) or a p-type (missing electrons in its structure). \rFIGURE 33.6 Grindingoperations used inshaping the siliconingot: (a) a form ofcylindrical grindingprovides diameter androundness control, and (b) a \ufb02at ground on the cylinder. \r\rIt is important to avoid contamination of the silicon during crystal growing, because contaminants, even in small amounts, can dramatically alter the electrical properties of Si. To minimize unwanted reactions with silicon and the introduction of contaminants at the elevated temperatures of crystal growing, the procedure is carried out either in an inert gas (argon or helium) or a vacuum. Choice of crucible material is also important; fused silica (SiO2), although not perfect for the application, represents the best available material and is used almost exclusively. Gradual dissolution of the crucible introduces oxygen as an unwanted impurity in the silicon boule. Unfortunately, the level of oxygen in the melt increases during the process, leading to a variation in concentration of the impurity throughout the length and diameter of the ingot. \r\r33.2.3 SHAPING OF SILICON INTO WAFERS \rA series of processing steps are used to reduce the boule into thin, disc-shaped wafers.The steps can be grouped as follows:(1) ingot preparation,(2) wafer slicing,and \r(3) wafer preparation. In ingot preparation, the seed and tang ends of the ingot are \ufb01 rst cut off, as well as portions of the ingot that do not meet the strict resistivity and crystallographic requirements for subsequent IC processing. Next, a form of cylindrical grinding, as shown in Figure 33.6(a), is used to shape the ingot into a more perfect cylinder, because the crystal-growing process cannot achieve suf\ufb01 cient control over diameter and roundness. One or more \ufb02 ats are then ground along the length of the ingot, as in Figure 33.6(b). After the wafers have been cut from the ingot, these \ufb02 ats serve several functions: (1) identi\ufb01cation, (2) orientation of the ICs relative to crystal structure, and (3) mechanical location during processing. \rThe ingot is now ready to be sliced into wafers, using the abrasive cutoff process illustrated in Figure 33.7. A very thin saw blade with diamond grit bonded to the internal diameter serves as the cutting edge. Use of the ID for slicing rather than the OD of the saw blade provides better control over \ufb02atness, thickness, parallelism, and surface characteristics of the wafer.

Thickness of the glass plate is around 2 mm (0.080 in), whereas the deposited \ufb01lm is only a few mm thick\u2014for some \ufb01lm materials, less than one mm. The mask itself is fabricated by lithography, the pattern being based on circuit design data, usually in the form of digital output from the CAD system used by the circuit designer. \r\r\rPhotoresists A photoresist is an organic polymer that is sensitive to light radiation in a certain wavelength range; the sensitivity causes either an increase or decrease in solubility of the polymer to certain chemicals. Typical practice in semiconductor processing is to use photoresists that are sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light has a short wavelength compared with visible light, permitting sharper imaging of microscopic circuit details on the wafer surface. It also permits the fabrication and photoresist areas in the plant to be illuminated at low light levels above the UV band. \rTwo types of photoresists are available: positive and negative. A positive resist becomes more soluble in developing solutions after exposure to light. A negative resist becomes less soluble (the polymer cross-links and hardens) when exposed to light. Figure 33.9 illustrates the operation of both resist types. Negative resists have better adhesion to SiO2 and metal surfaces and good etch resistance. However, positive resists achieve better resolution, which has made it the more widely used technique as IC feature sizes have become smaller and smaller. \rExposure Techniques The resists are exposed through the mask by one of three exposure techniques: (a) contact printing, (b) proximity printing, and (c) projection printing, illustrated in Figure 33.10. In contact printing, the mask is pressed against the resist coating during exposure.This results in high resolution of the pattern onto the wafer surface; an important disadvantage is that physical contact with the wafers gradually wears out the mask. In proximity printing, the mask is separated from the resist coating by a distance of 10 to 25 mm (0.0004\u20130.001 in). This eliminates mask wear, but resolution of the image is slightly reduced. Projection printing involves the use of a high-quality lens (or mirror) system to project the image through the \r(c) projection printing. \rFIGURE 33.11 Optical lithography process applied to a silicon wafer: (1) prepare surface; (2) apply photoresist; (3) soft-bake; \r(4) \ralign mask and expose; (5) develop resist; (6) hard-bake; \r\r(7)\r etch; (8) strip resist. \r\r\r\r\rmask onto the wafer.

It is desired to remove the SiO2 \ufb01lm in certain regions as de\ufb01ned by the mask pattern. The sequence for a positive resist proceeds as follows, illustrated in Figure 33.11. (1) Prepare surface. The wafer is properly cleaned to promote wetting and adhesion of the resist. (2) Apply photoresist. In semiconductor processing, photoresists are applied by feeding a metered amount of liquid resist onto the center of the wafer and then spinning the wafer to spread the liquid and achieve a uniform coating thickness. Desired thickness is around 1 mm (0.00004 in), which gives good resolution yet minimizes pinhole defects. (3) Soft-bake. The purpose of this pre-exposure bake is to remove solvents, promote adhesion, and harden the resist. Typical soft-bake temperatures are around 90\u00b0C (190\u00b0F) for 10 to 20 min. (4) Align mask and expose. The pattern mask is aligned relative to the wafer and the resist is exposed through the mask by one of the methods described above. Alignment must be accomplished with very high precision, using optical-mechanical equipment designed speci\ufb01cally for the purpose. If the wafer has been previously processed by lithography so that a pattern has already been formed in the wafer, then sub sequent masks must be accurately registered relative to the existing pattern. Exposure of the resist depends on the same basic rule as in photography\u2014the exposure is a function of light intensity $ time. A mercury arc lamp or other source of UV light is used. (5) Develop resist. The exposed wafer is next immersed in a developing solution, or the solution is sprayed onto the wafer surface. For the positive resist in the example, the exposed areas are dissolved in the developer, thus leaving the SiO2 surface uncovered in these areas. Development is usually followed by a rinse to stop develop ment and remove residual chemicals. (6) Hard-bake. This baking step expels volatiles remain ing from the developing solution and increases adhesion of the resist especially at the newly created edges of the resist \ufb01 lm. (7) Etch. Etching removes the SiO2 layer at selected regions where the resist has been removed. (8) Strip resist. After etching, the resist coating that remains on the surface must be removed. Stripping is accomplished using either wet or dry techniques. Wet stripping uses liquid chemicals; a mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2SO4\u2014H2O2) is common. Dry stripping uses plasma etching with oxygen as the reactive gas. \r\r\rAlthough the example describes the use of optical lithography to remove a thin \ufb01lm of SiO2 from a silicon substrate, the same basic procedure is followed for other processing steps. The purpose of optical lithography in all of these steps is to expose speci\ufb01c regions beneath the photoresist layer so that some process can be performed on these exposed regions. In the processing of a given wafer, optical lithography is repeated as many times as needed to produce the desired integrated circuit, each time using a different mask to de\ufb01ne the appropriate pattern.

For each technique, special resist materials are required that react to the particular type of radiation. \rExtreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) represents a re\ufb01nement of conventional UV lithography through the use of shorter wavelengths during exposure. The ultraviolet wavelength spectrum ranges from about 10 nm to 380 nm (nm  nanometer ! 109 m), the upper end of which is close to the visible light range ( 400\u2013700 nm wavelengths).EUV uses wavelengths in the range 10 nm to 14 nm,which permits the feature size of an integrated circuit to be reduced to about 0.05 mm (50nm) [15].Thiscompares with about 0.1 mm (100 nm) using conventional UV exposure. \rCompared with UV and EUV lithography, electron-beam (E-Beam) lithography virtually eliminates diffraction during exposure of the resist, thus permitting higher resolution of the image. Another potential advantage is that a scanning E-beam can be directed to expose only certain regions of the wafer surface, thus eliminating the need for a mask. Unfortunately, high-quality electron-beam systems are expensive. Also, because of the time-consuming sequential nature of the exposure method, production rates are low compared with the mask techniques of optical lithography. Accordingly, use of E-beam lithography tends to be limited to small production quantities. E-beam techniques are widely used for making the masks in UV lithography. \rX-ray lithography has been under development since around 1972.As in E-beam lithography, the wavelengths of X-rays are much shorter than UV light (X-ray wavelength ranges from 0.005 nm to several dozen nm, overlapping the lower end of the UV range). Thus, they hold the promise of sharper imaging during exposure of the resist. X-rays are dif\ufb01cult to focus during lithography. Consequently, contact or proxi mity printing must be used, and a small X-ray source must be used at a relatively large distance from the wafer surface to achieve good image resolution through the mask. \rIon beam lithography systems divide into two categories: (1) focused ion beam systems, whose operation is similar to a scanning E-beam system and avoids the need for a mask; and (2) masked ion beam systems, which expose the resist through a mask by proximity printing. As with E-beam and X-ray systems, ion lithography produces higher image resolution than conventional UV optical lithography. \r\r\r\r\rLayer Processes Used in IC Fabrication \rThe steps required to produce an integrated circuit consist of chemical and physical processes that add, alter, or remove regions on the silicon wafer that have been de\ufb01ned by optical lithography.These regions constitute the insulating,semiconducting, and conducting areas that form the devices and their interconnections in the integrated circuits. The layers are fabricated one at a time, step by step, each layer having a different con\ufb01guration and each requiring a separate mask, until all of the microscopic details of the electronic devices and conducting paths have been constructed on the wafer surface. \r\rThis section considers the wafer processes used to add, alter, and subtract layers.

Silicon dioxide (SiO2) is an insulator, contrasted with the semiconducting properties of Si. The ease with which a thin \ufb01lm of SiO2 can be produced on the surface of a silicon wafer is one of the attractive features of silicon as a semiconductor material. \rSilicon dioxide serves a number of important functions in IC fabrication: (1) It is used as a mask to prevent diffusion or ion implantation of dopants into silicon. (2) It is used to isolate devices in the circuit. (3) It provides electrical insulation between levels in multilevel metallization systems. \rSeveral processes are used to form SiO2 in semiconductor manufacturing, depending on when during chip fabrication the oxide must be added. The most common process is thermal oxidation, appropriate for growing SiO2 \ufb01 lms on silicon substrates. In thermal oxidation, the wafer is exposed to an oxidizing atmosphere at elevated temperature; either oxygen or steam atmospheres are used, with the following reactions, respectively: \rSi  O2 \u2192 SiO2 (33.4) \ror \rSi  2H2O \u2192 SiO2  2H2 (33.5) \r\rTypical temperatures used in thermal oxidation of silicon range from 900\u00b0C to 1200\u00b0C (1650\u00b0F to 2200\u00b0F). By controlling temperature and time, oxide \ufb01lms of predictable thicknesses can be obtained. The equations show that silicon at the surface of the wafer is consumed in the reaction,as seen in Figure 33.13.To grow a SiO2 \ufb01lm of thickness d requires a layer of silicon that is 0.44d thick. \rFIGURE 33.13 Growth of SiO2 \ufb01lm on a silicon substrate by thermaloxidation, showingchanges in thicknessthat occur: (1) beforeoxidation, and (2) afterthermal oxidation. \r\r\rWhen a silicon dioxide \ufb01lm must be applied to surfaces other than silicon, then \rdirect thermal oxidation is not appropriate. An alternative process must be used, \rsuch as chemical vapor deposition. \r\r\r33.4.2 CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION \rChemical vapor deposition (CVD) involves growth of a thin \ufb01lm on the surface of a heated substrate by chemical reactions or decomposition of gases (Section 27.5.2). CVD is widely used in the processing of integrated circuit wafers to add layers of silicon, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride (Si3N4), and various metallization materials (discussed below). Plasma-enhanced CVD is often used because it permits the reactions to take place at lower temperatures. \rTypical CVD Reactions in IC Fabrication In the case of silicon dioxide, if the surface of the wafer is only silicon (e.g., at the start of IC fabrication), then thermal oxidation is the appropriate process by which to form a layer of SiO2. If the oxide layer must be grown over materials other than silicon, such as aluminum or silicon nitride, then some alternative technique must be used, such as CVD. Chemical vapor deposition of SiO2 is accomplished by reacting a silicon compound such as silane (SiH4) with oxygen onto a heated substrate. The reaction is carried out at around 425\u00b0C (~800\u00b0F) and can be summarized: \rSiH4  O2 \u2192 SiO2  2H2 (33.6) \rThe density of the silicon dioxide \ufb01 lm and its bonding to the substrate is generally poorer than that achieved by thermal oxidation.

CVD can be used to deposit layers of doped SiO2, such as phosphorous-doped silicon dioxide (called P-glass). \rSilicon nitride is used as a masking layer during oxidation of silicon. Si3N4 has a low oxidation rate compared with Si, so a nitride mask can be used to prevent oxidation in coated areas on the silicon surface. Silicon nitride is also used as a passivation layer (protecting against sodium diffusion and moisture).A conventional CVD process for coating Si3N4 onto a silicon wafer involves reaction of silane and ammonia (NH3) at around 750\u00b0C (~1400\u00b0F): \r3SiH4  4NH3 \u2192 Si3N4  12H2 (33.7) \rPlasma-enhanced CVD is also used for basically the same coating reaction, the advantage being that it can be performed at much lower temperatures\u2014around 300\u00b0C (~570\u00b0F). \rPolycrystalline silicon (called polysilicon to distinguish it from silicon having a single crystal structure such as the boule and wafer) has a number of uses in IC fabrication, including [14]: conducting material for leads, gate electrodes in MOS devices, and contact material in shallow junction devices. Chemical vapor deposition to coat polysilicon onto a wafer involves reduction of silane at temperatures around 600\u00b0C (~1100\u00b0F): \rSiH4 \u2192 Si  2H2 (33.8) \r\rEpitaxial Deposition A related process for growing a \ufb01 lm onto a substrate is epitaxial deposition, in which the \ufb01 lm has a crystalline structure that is an extension of the substrate\u2019s structure. If the \ufb01lm material is the same as the substrate (e.g., silicon on silicon), then its crystal lattice will be identical to and a continuation of the wafer crystal. Two primary techniques to perform epitaxial deposition are vapor-phase epitaxy and molecular-beam epitaxy. \rVapor-phase epitaxy is the more important in semiconductor processing and is based on chemical vapor deposition. In growing silicon on silicon, the process is accomplished under closely controlled conditions at higher temperatures than conventional CVD of Si, using diluted reacting gases to slow the process so that an epitaxial layer can be successfully formed. Various reactions are possible, including Equation (33.8), but the most widely used industrial process involves hydrogen reduction of silicon tetrachloride gas (SiCl4) at around 1200\u00b0C (~2200\u00b0F) as follows: \rSiCl4  2H2 \u2192 Si  4HCl (33.9) \r\rThe melting point of silicon is 1410\u00b0C (2570\u00b0F), so the preceding reaction is carried out at temperatures below Tm for Si, considered an advantage for vapor-phase epitaxy. \rMolecular-beam epitaxy uses a vacuum evaporation process (Section 27.5.1), in which silicon together with one or more dopants are vaporized and transported to the substrate in a vacuum chamber. Its advantage is that it can be carried out at lower tempera tures than CVD; processing temperatures are 400\u00b0C to 900\u00b0C (~750\u00b0F\u2013 ~1650\u00b0F).

Adding impurities into the silicon surface is called doping. The doped regions are used to create p-n junctions that form the transistors, diodes, and other devices in the circuit. A silicon-dioxide mask produced by thermal oxidation and optical lithography is used to isolate the silicon regions that are to be doped. Common elements used as impurities are boron (B) which forms electron acceptor regions in the silicon substrate (p-type regions); and phosphorous (P), arsenic (As), and antimony (Sb), which form electron donor regions (n-type regions). The predominant technique by which silicon is doped with these elements is ion implantation. \rIn ion implantation (Section 27.2.2), vaporized ions of the impurity element are accelerated by an electric \ufb01 eld and directed at the silicon substrate surface.The atoms penetrate into the surface, losing energy and \ufb01 nally stopping at some depth in the crystal structure, the average depth being determined by the mass of the ion and the acceleration voltage. Higher voltages produce greater depths of penetration, typically several hundred Angstroms (1 Angstrom  104 mm  101 nm). Advantages of ion implantation are that it can be accomplished at room temperature and it provides exact doping density. \rThe problem with ion implantation is that the ion collisions disrupt and damage the crystal lattice structure. Very high energy collisions can transform the starting crystalline material into an amorphous structure. This problem is solved by annealing at temperatures between 500\u00b0C and 900\u00b0C (930\u00b0F and 1650\u00b0F), which allows the lattice structure to repair itself and return to its crystal state. \r\r33.4.4 METALLIZATION \rConductive materials must be deposited onto the wafer during processing to serve several functions: (1) forming certain components (e.g., gates) of devices in the IC; \r(2) providing conduction paths between devices on the chip; and (3) connecting the chip to external circuits. To satisfy these functions the conducting materials must be formed into very \ufb01 ne patterns. The process of fabricating these patterns is known as metallization, and it combines various thin \ufb01lm deposition technologies with optical lithography. This section is concerned with the materials and processes used in metal lization. Connecting the chip to external circuitry involves IC packaging, which is described in Section 33.6. \rMetallization Materials Materials used in the metallization of silicon-based integrated circuits must have certain desirable properties, some of which relate to electrical function whereas others relate to manufacturing processing. The desirable properties of a metallization material are [5], [14]: (1) low resistivity; (2) low-contact resistance with silicon, (3) good adherence to the underlying material, usually Si or SiO2; (4) ease of deposition, compatible with optical lithography; (5) chemical stability\u2013noncorroding, nonreactive, and noncontaminating; (6) physical stability during temperatures encountered in processing; and (7) good lifetime stability. \rAlthough no material meets all of these requirements perfectly, aluminum satis\ufb01 es most of them either well or adequately, and it has been the most widely used metallization material. Other metallization materials include titanium, titanium nitride, and copper [15]. Aluminum is usually alloyed with small amounts of (1) silicon to reduce reactivity with silicon in the substrate, and (2) copper to inhibit electromigration of Al atoms caused by current \ufb02 ow when the IC is in service. Other materials used for metallization in integrated circuits include polysilicon (Si); gold (Au); refractory metals (e.g., W, Mo); silicides (e.g., WSi2, MoSi2, TaSi2); and nitrides (e.g., TiN, TaN, and ZrN). These other materials are generally used in applications such as gates and contacts. Aluminum is generally favored for device interconnections and top level connections to external circuitry. \rMetallization Processes Several processes are available to accomplish metallization in IC fabrication: physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and electroplating.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 44449, "end_char_idx": 48966, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8787e276-2b4e-4a5d-ae15-5148571d394d": {"__data__": {"id_": "8787e276-2b4e-4a5d-ae15-5148571d394d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec33.txt", "file_name": "sec33.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79761, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a618bec8-5017-490b-867b-dc33f36fb259", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec33.txt", "file_name": "sec33.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79761, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "55af42749f7d2edd862a64cb957f376c7b546b5e9133f579b88bb8cd2c7cf66c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "14203b82-8894-4487-ad6e-c463a83ea726", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec33.txt", "file_name": "sec33.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79761, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "7bfa1b9afc969d3b8cafdc2509e6e4cbfb10006bce21b2c51c77071674d0165b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c44fe9c6-53d7-4df2-ab46-1e98ca37a083", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "aeb3d6bd8ddffe5ad4cb7d7cb8d586d725989609a96efd411789dfcf3a4009b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Aluminum is usually alloyed with small amounts of (1) silicon to reduce reactivity with silicon in the substrate, and (2) copper to inhibit electromigration of Al atoms caused by current \ufb02 ow when the IC is in service.

Aluminum is generally favored for device interconnections and top level connections to external circuitry. \rMetallization Processes Several processes are available to accomplish metallization in IC fabrication: physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and electroplating. Among PVD processes, vacuum evaporation and sputtering are applicable (Section 27.5.1). Vacuum evaporation can be applied for aluminum metallization. Vaporization is usually accomplished by resistance heating or electron beam evaporation. Evaporation is dif\ufb01cult or impossible for depositing refractory metals and compounds. Sputtering can be used for depositing aluminum as well as refractory metals and certain metallizing compounds. It achieves better step coverage than evaporation, often important after many processing cycles when the surface contour has become irregular. However, deposition rates are lower and equipment is more expensive. \rChemical vapor deposition is also applicable as a metallization technique. Its processing advantages include excellent step coverage and good deposition rates. Materials suited to CVD include tungsten, molybdenum, titanium nitride, and most of the silicides used in semiconductor metallization. CVD for metallization in semiconductor processing is less common than PVD. Finally, electroplating (Section 27.3.1) is occasionally used in IC fabrication to increase the thickness of thin \ufb01 lms. \r\r\r33.4.5 ETCHING \rAll of the preceding processes in this section involve addition of material to the wafer surface, either in the form of a thin \ufb01lm or the doping of the surface with an impurity element. Certain steps in IC manufacturing require material removal from the surface; this is accomplished by etching away the unwanted material. Etching is usually done selectively, by coating surface areas that are to be protected and leaving other areas exposed for etching. The coating may be an etch-resistant photoresist, or it may be a previously applied layer of material such as silicon dioxide. Etching was brie\ufb02y encountered in the previous discussion of optical lithography. This section gives some of the technical details of this step in IC fabrication. \rThe two main categories of etching process in semiconductor processing are wet chemical etching and dry plasma etching. Wet chemical etching is the older of the two processes and is easier to use. However, there are certain disadvantages that have resulted in growing use of dry plasma etching. \rWet Chemical Etching Wet chemical etching involves the use of an aqueous solution, usually an acid, to etch away a target material. The etching solution is selected because it chemically attacks the speci\ufb01c material to be removed and not the protective layer used as a mask. Some of the common etchants used to remove materials in wafer processing are listed in Table 33.2. \rIn its simplest form, the process can be accomplished by immersing the masked wafers in an appropriate etchant for a speci\ufb01ed time and then immediately transferring them to a thorough rinsing procedure to stop the etching. Process variables such as immersion time, etchant concentration, and temperature are important in determining the amount of material removed. A properly etched layer will have a pro\ufb01le as shown in Figure 33.14.

In practical cases, the other materials exposed to the etchant may be attacked but to a lesser degree than the target material. The etch selectivity of the etchant is the ratio of etching rates between the target material and some other material, such as a mask or substrate. For example, etch selectivity of hydro\ufb02uoric acid for SiO2 over Si is in\ufb01nite. \r\rTABLE \u2022 33.2 Some common chemical etchants used in semiconductor processing. \r\rIf process control is inadequate, either under-etching or over-etching can occur, as in Figure 33.15. Underetching, in which the target layer is not completely removed, results when the etching time is too short and/or the etching solution is too weak. Over-etching involves too much of the target material being removed, resulting in loss of pattern de\ufb01nition and possible damage to the layer beneath the target layer. Over-etching is caused by overexposure to the etchant. \rDry Plasma Etching This etching process uses an ionized gas to etch a target material. The ionized gas is created by introducing an appropriate gas mixture into a vacuum chamber and using radio frequency (RF) electrical energy to ionize a portion of the gas, thus creating a plasma. The high-energy plasma reacts with the target surface, vaporizing the material to remove it. There are several ways in which a plasma can be used to etch a material; the two principal processes in IC fabrication are plasma etching and reactive ion etching. \rIn plasma etching, the function of the ionized gas is to generate atoms or molecules that are chemically very reactive, so that the target surface is chemically etched upon exposure. The plasma etchants are usually based on \ufb02uorine or chlorine gases. Etch selectivity is generally more of a problem in plasma etching than in wet chemical etching. For example, etch selectivity for SiO2 over Si in a typical plasma etching process is 15 at best [4], compared with in\ufb01nity when HF chemical etching is used. \rAn alternative function of the ionized gas can be to physically bombard the target material, causing atoms to be ejected from the surface. This is the process of sputtering, one of the techniques in physical vapor deposition. When used for etching, the process is called sputter etching. Although this form of etching has been applied in semiconductor processing,it is much more common to combine sputtering with plasma \r\r\rFIGURE 33.16 \r(a) A fully anisotropicetch, with A ! `; and (b) a partiallyanisotropic etch, withA  approximately 1.3. \r\retching as described previously, which results in the process known as reactive ion etching.

As IC feature sizes continue to shrink, anisotropy becomes increasingly important for achieving the required dimensional tolerances. \r\r\r\rIntegrating the Fabrication Steps \rSections 33.3 and 33.4 examined the individual processing technologies used in IC fabrication. This section shows how these technologies are combined into the sequence of steps to produce an integrated circuit. \rThe planar processing sequence consists of fabricating a series of layers of various materials in selected areas on a silicon substrate. The layers form insulating, semi-conducting, or conducting regions on the substrate to create the particular electronic devices required in the integrated circuit. The layers might also serve the temporary function of masking certain areas so that a particular process is only applied to desired portions of the surface. The masks are subsequently removed. \rThe layers are formed by thermal oxidation, epitaxial growth, deposition techniques (CVD and PVD), diffusion, and ion implantation. Table 33.3 summarizes the processes typically used to add or alter a layer of a given material type. The use of lithography to apply a particular process only to selected regions of the surface is illustrated in Figure 33.17. \rAn example will be useful here to show the process integration in IC fabrication. An n-channel metal oxide semiconductor (NMOS) logic device will be used \rTABLE \u2022 33.3 Layer materials added or altered in IC fabrication and associated processes. \r\rto illustrate the processing sequence. The sequence for NMOS integrated circuits is less complex than for CMOS or bipolar technologies, although the processes for these IC categories are basically similar. The device to be fabricated is illustrated in Figure 33.1. \rThe starting substrate is a lightly doped p-type silicon wafer, which will form the base of the n-channel transistor. The processing steps are illustrated in Figure 33.18 and described here (some details have been simpli\ufb01ed, and the metallization process for interconnecting devices has been omitted): (1) A layer of Si3N4 is deposited by CVD onto the Si substrate using optical lithography to de\ufb01ne the regions.

These \ufb01nal steps are referred to as IC packaging. \rPackaging of integrated circuits is concerned with design issues such as (1) electrical connections to external circuits; (2) materials to encase the chip and protect it from the environment (humidity, corrosion, temperature, vibration, mechanical shock); (3) heat dissipation; (4) performance, reliability, and service life; and (5) cost. \rThere are also manufacturing issues in packaging, including: (1) chip separation\u2014 cutting the wafer into individual chips, (2) connecting it to the package, (3) encapsulating the chip, and (4) circuit testing. The manufacturing issues are the ones of greatest interest in this section. Although most of the design issues are properly left to other texts [8], [11],[13], and [15],some of the engineering aspects of IC packages, also known as chip carriers, and the types of packages are discussed here, before describing the processing steps to make them. \r33.6.1 IC PACKAGE DESIGN \rThis section considers three topics related to the design of an integrated circuit package: (1) the number of input/output terminals required for an IC of a given size, \r(2) the materials used in IC packages, and (3) package styles. \rDetermining the Number of Input/Output Terminals The basic engineering problem in IC packaging is to connect the many internal circuits to input/output (I/O) terminals so that the appropriate electrical signals can be communicated \r\raDe\ufb01nitions were compiled from [19], [20], [22], and [24]. bValues compiled from data at [25]. \rbetween the IC and the outside world. As the number of devices in an IC increases, the required number of I/O terminals (leads) also increases. The problem is of course aggravated by trends in semiconductor technology that have led to decreases in device size and increases in the number of devices that can be packed into an IC. Fortunately, the number of I/O terminals does not have to equal the number of devices in the IC. The dependency between the two values is given by Rent\u2019s rule, named after the IBM engineer (E. F. Rent) who de\ufb01ned the following relationship around 1960: \rm\rnio ! C nic (33.11) \rwhere nio  the required number of input/output terminals or external signal connections; nic  the number of internal circuits in the IC, usually taken to be the number of logic gates; and C and m are parameters in the equation. \rThe parameters in Rent\u2019s rule depend on the type of circuit and the design of the \rIC. Memory devices require far fewer I/O terminals than microprocessors due to their column and row structures. Typical values of the Constant C and exponent m for several common integrated circuit devices are listed in Table 33.4. \r\r\r\rThe 18-mm square chips from Example 33.1 have a processable area of 17 mm by 17 mm.The density of circuits (e.g.,transistors) within each chip\u2019s processable area is 500 circuits per mm2.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 58533, "end_char_idx": 62558, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f32f384-2597-4d9a-abc2-a5593cbe634d": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f32f384-2597-4d9a-abc2-a5593cbe634d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec33.txt", "file_name": "sec33.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79761, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a618bec8-5017-490b-867b-dc33f36fb259", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec33.txt", "file_name": "sec33.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79761, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "55af42749f7d2edd862a64cb957f376c7b546b5e9133f579b88bb8cd2c7cf66c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4ee1c5cb-aefa-4c40-b04d-a27c91580fc2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec33.txt", "file_name": "sec33.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79761, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4c777ee9874f732f030ef4415b437f5cdd511a6724bb69a517283d7b001a6342", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "160545b5-04b5-433d-94b3-1e321dce1b49", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e20a15402ad17f1f6ae6f467c1cbe9362bec4e882d55fcc40ae7c3a35a24240", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "C nic (33.11) \rwhere nio  the required number of input/output terminals or external signal connections; nic  the number of internal circuits in the IC, usually taken to be the number of logic gates; and C and m are parameters in the equation. \rThe parameters in Rent\u2019s rule depend on the type of circuit and the design of the \rIC.

Two material types dominate current packaging technology: ceramic and plastic. Metal was used in early packaging designs but is today no longer important, except for lead frames. \rThe common ceramic packaging material is alumina (Al2O3).Advantages of ceramic packaging include hermetic sealing of the IC chip and the fact that highly complex packages can be produced. Disadvantages include poor dimensional control because of shrinkage during \ufb01ring and the high dielectric constant of alumina. \rPlastic IC packages are not hermetically sealed, but their cost is lower than ceramic. They are generally used for mass produced ICs, where very high reliability is not required. Plastics used in IC packaging include epoxies, polyimides, and silicones. \rIC Package Styles A wide variety of IC package styles is available to meet the input/output requirements indicated above. In nearly all applications, the IC is a component in a larger electronic system and must be attached to a printed circuit board (PCB). There are two broad categories of component mounting to a PCB, shown in Figure 33.19: through-hole and surface mount. In through-hole technology, also known as pin-in-hole (PIH) technology, the IC package and other electronic components (e.g., discrete resistors, capacitors) have leads that are inserted through holes in the board and are soldered on the underside. In surface-mount technology (SMT), the components are attached to the surface of the board (or in some cases, both top and bottom surfaces). Several lead con\ufb01gurations are available in SMT, as illustrated in (b), (c), and (d) of the \ufb01gure.

The dual in-line package (DIP) is a common form of IC package, available in both through-hole and surface-mount con\ufb01 gurations. It has two rows of leads (terminals) on either side of a rectangular body, as in Figure 33.20. Spacing between leads (center-to-center distance) in the conventional through-hole DIP is 2.54 mm (0.1 in), and the number of leads ranges between 8 and 64. Hole spacing in the through-hole DIP style is limited by the ability to drill holes closely together in a printed circuit board. This limitation can be relaxed with surface-mount technology because the leads are not inserted into the board; standard lead spacing on surface-mount DIPs is 1.27 mm (0.05 in). \rThe number of terminals in a DIP is limited by its rectangular shape in which leads project only from two sides; that means that the number of leads on either side is nio/2. For high values of nio (between 48 and 64), differences in conducting lengths between leads in the middle of the DIP and those on the ends cause problems in high-speed electrical characteristics. Some of these problems are addressed with a square package, in which the leads are arranged around the periphery so that the number of terminals on a side is nio/4. A surface-mount square package is illustrated in Figure 33.21. \rEven with a square package, there is still a practical upper limit on terminal count dictated by the manner in which the leads in the package are linearly allocated. The number of leads on a package can be maximized by using a square matrix of leads. This chip carrier type is called a pin grid array (PGA) in through-hole technology and a ball grid array (BGA) in surface mount. In either case, the package consists of a two-dimensional array of terminals on the underside of a square chip enclosure. In the PGA, the terminals are pins that are inserted into through holes in the printed circuit board, whereas in the BGA, tiny balls of solder replace the pins and are soldered directly to copper pads on the PCB. Ideally, the entire bottom surface of the package is fully occupied by terminals, so that the terminal count in each direction is square root of nio. However, as a practical matter, the center area of the package has no terminals because this region contains the IC chip. \r\r\r\r33.6.2 PROCESSING STEPS IN IC PACKAGING \rThe packaging of an IC chip in manufacturing can be divided into the following steps: (1) wafer testing, (2) chip separation, (3) die bonding, (4) wire bonding, and \r(5) package sealing. After packaging, a \ufb01nal functional test is performed on each packaged IC. \rWafer Testing Current semiconductor processing techniques provide many indivi dual ICs per wafer. It is convenient to perform certain functional tests on the ICs while they are still together on the wafer\u2014before chip separation. Testing is accomplished by computer-controlled test equipment that uses a set of needle probes con\ufb01gured to match the connecting pads on the surface of the chip; multi-probe is the term used for this testing procedure.When the probes contact the pads, a series of DC tests are carried out to indicate short circuits and other faults; this is followed by a functional test of the IC. Chips that fail the test are marked with an ink dot; these defects are not packaged. Each IC is positioned in its turn beneath the probes for testing, using a high precision x-y table to index the wafer from one chip site to the next. \rChip Separation The next step after testing is to cut the wafer into individual chips (dice). A thin diamond-impregnated saw blade is used to perform the cutting operation. The sawing machine is highly automatic and its alignment with the \u201cstreets\u201d between circuits is very accurate.

Each IC is positioned in its turn beneath the probes for testing, using a high precision x-y table to index the wafer from one chip site to the next. \rChip Separation The next step after testing is to cut the wafer into individual chips (dice). A thin diamond-impregnated saw blade is used to perform the cutting operation. The sawing machine is highly automatic and its alignment with the \u201cstreets\u201d between circuits is very accurate. The wafer is attached to a piece of adhesive tape that is mounted in a frame. The adhesive tape holds the individual chips in place during and after sawing; the frame is a convenience in subsequent handling of the chips. Chips with ink dots are now discarded. \rDie Bonding The individual chips must next be attached to their individual packages, a procedure called die bonding. Owing to the miniature size of the chips, automated handling systems are used to pick the separated chips from the tape frame and place them for die bonding.Various techniques have been developed to bond the chip to the packaging substrate; two methods are described here: eutectic die bonding and epoxy die bonding. Eutectic die bonding, used for ceramic packages, consists of \r(1) depositing a thin \ufb01lm of gold on the bottom surface of the chip; (2) heating the base of the ceramic package to a temperature above 370\u00b0C (~700\u00b0F), the eutectic temperature of the Au\u2014Si system; and (3) bonding the chip to the metallization pattern on the heated base. In epoxy die bonding, used for plastic VLSI packaging, a small amount of epoxy is dispensed on the package base (the lead frame), and the chip is positioned on the epoxy; the epoxy is then cured, bonding the chip to the surface. \rWire Bonding After the die is bonded to the package, electrical connections are made between the contact pads on the chip surface and the package leads. The connections are generally made using small-diameter wires of aluminum or gold, as illustrated in Figure 33.22. Typical wire diameters for aluminum are 0.05 mm \r(0.002 in), and gold wire diameters are about half that diameter (Au has higher electrical conductivity thanAl,but is more expensive).Aluminum wires are bonded by ultrasonic bonding, whereas gold wires are bonded by thermocompression, thermosonic, or ultrasonic means. Ultrasonic bonding uses ultrasonic energy to weld the wire to the pad surface. Thermocompression bonding involves heating the end of the wire to form a molten ball, and then the ball is pressed into the pad to form the bond. Thermosonic bonding combines ultrasonic and thermal energies to form the bond. Automatic wire bonding machines are used to perform these operations at rates up to 200 bonds per minute. \r\rPackage Sealing As mentioned, the two common packaging materials are ceramic and plastic. The processing methods are different for the two materials. Ceramic packages are made from a dispersion of ceramic powder (Al2O3 is most common) in a liquid binder (e.g., polymer and solvent). The mix is \ufb01 rst formed into thin sheets and dried, and then cut to size. Holes are punched for interconnections. The required wiring paths are then fabricated onto each sheet, and metal is \ufb01 lled into the holes. The sheets are then laminated by pressing and sintering to form a monolithic (single stone) body. \rTwo types of plastic package are available, postmolded and premolded. In post-molded packages, an epoxy plastic is transfer molded around the assembled chip and lead frame (after wire bonding), in effect transforming the pieces into one solid body. However, the molding process can be harsh on the delicate bond wires, and premolded packages are an alternative. In premolded packaging, an enclosure base is molded before encapsulation and then the chip and lead frame are connected to it, adding a solid lid or other material to provide protection. \rFinal Testing Upon completion of the packaging sequence, each IC must undergo a \ufb01nal test, the purpose of which is to (1) determine which units, if any, have been damaged during packaging; and (2) measure performance characteristics of each device. \rBurn-in test procedures sometimes include elevated temperature testing, in which the packaged IC is placed in an oven at temperatures around 125\u00b0C (250\u00b0F) for 24 hours and then tested.

A device that fails such a test would have been likely to have failed early during service. If the device is intended for environments in which wide temperature variations occur, a temperature cycle test is appropriate. This test subjects each device to a series of temperature reversals, between values around 50\u00b0C (60\u00b0F) on the lower side and 125\u00b0C (250\u00b0F) on the upper side. Additional tests for devices requiring high reliability might include mechanical vibration tests and hermetic (leak) tests. \r\r\r\r\rYields in IC Processing \rThe fabrication of integrated circuits consists of many processing steps performed in sequence. In wafer processing in particular, there may be hundreds of distinct operations through which the wafer passes. At each step, there is a chance that something may go wrong, resulting in the loss of the wafer or portions of it corresponding to individual chips. A simple probability model to predict the \ufb01nal yield of good product is \rY ! Y1Y2 . . . Yn \r\rwhere Y  \ufb01nal yield; Y1, Y2, Yn are the yields of each processing step; and n  total number of steps in the processing sequence. \rAs a practical matter, this model, although perfectly valid, is dif\ufb01cult to use because of the large number of steps involved and the variability of yields for each step. It is more convenient to divide the processing sequence into major phases (see Figure 33.3) and to de\ufb01ne the yields for each phase. The \ufb01rst phase involves growth of the single-crystal boule. The term crystal yield Yc refers to the amount of single-crystal material in the boule compared with the starting amount of electronic grade silicon. The typical crystal yield is about 50%. After crystal growing, the boule is sliced into wafers, the yield for which is described as the crystal-to-slice yield Ys. This depends on the amount of material lost during grinding of the boule, the width of the saw blade relative to the wafer thickness during slicing, and other losses. A typical value might be 50%, although much of the lost silicon during grinding and slicing is recyclable. \rThe next phase is wafer processing to fabricate the individual ICs. From a yield viewpoint, this can be divided into wafer yield and multiprobe yield. Wafer yield Yw refers to the number of wafers that survive processing compared to the starting quantity. Certain wafers are designated as test pieces or similar uses and therefore result in losses and a reduction in yield; in other cases, wafers are broken or processing conditions go awry. Typical values of wafer yield are around 70% if testing losses are included. For wafers that come through processing and are multiprobe tested, only a certain proportion pass the test, called the multi-probe yield Ym. Multiprobe yield is highly variable and can range from very low values (< 10%) to relatively high values (> 90%), depending on IC complexity and worker skill in the processing areas. \rFollowing packaging,\ufb01nal testing of the IC is performed.This invariably produces additional losses, resulting in a \ufb01nal test yield Yt in the range 90% to 95%. If the \ufb01ve phase yields are combined, the \ufb01nal yield can be estimated by\r Y ! Yc Ys YwYmYt (33.12) \r\rGiven the typical values at each step, the \ufb01nal yield compared with the starting amount of silicon is quite low. \rThe heart of IC fabrication is wafer processing, the yield from which is measured in multiprobe testing Ym.

Yields in the other areas are fairly predictable, but not in wafer-fab.Two types of processing defects can be distinguished in wafer processing: \r(1) area defects and (2) point defects. Area defects are those that affect major areas of the wafer, possibly the entire surface.These are caused by variations or incorrect settings in process parameters. Examples include added layers that are too thin or too thick, insuf\ufb01 cient diffusion depths in doping, and over-or under-etching. In general these defects are correctable by improved process control or development of alter native processes that are superior. For example, doping by ion implantation has largely replaced diffusion, and dry plasma etching has been substituted for wet chemical etching to better control feature dimensions. \rPoint defects occur at very localized areas on the wafer surface, affecting only one or a limited number of ICs in a particular area. They are commonly caused by dust particles either on the wafer surface or the lithographic masks. Point defects also include dislocations in the crystal lattice structure (Section 2.3.2).These point defects are distributed in some way over the surface of the wafer, resulting in a yield that is a function of the density of the defects, their distribution over the surface, and the processed area of the wafer. If the area defects are assumed negligible, and the point defects are assumed uniform over the surface area of the wafer, the resulting yield can be modeled by the equation \r1\rYm ! (33.13)\r1 # AD \rwhere Ym  the yield of good chips as determined in multiprobe; A  the area processed, cm2 (in2); and D  density of point defects, defects/cm2 (defects/in2).

The ICs and other components are mounted and interconnected on printed circuit boards, which in turn are interconnected and contained in a chassis or cabinet. Chip packaging (Section 33.6) is only part of the total electronic package. This chapter considers the remaining levels of packaging and how the packages are manufactured and assembled. \r\r\r\r\r\rElectronics Packaging \rThe electronics package is the physical means by which the components in a system are electrically interconnected and interfaced to external devices; it includes the mechanical structure that holds and protects the circuitry. A well-designed electronics package serves the following functions: (1) power distribution and signal interconnection, (2) structural support, (3) circuit protection from physical and chemical hazards in the environment, (4) dissipation of heat generated by the circuits, and (5) minimum delays in signal transmission within the system. \rFor complex systems containing many components and interconnections, the electronics package is organized into levels that comprise a packaging hierarchy, illus trated in Figure 34.1 and summarized in Table 34.1. The lowest level is the zero level, which refers to the intraconnections on the semiconductor chip. The packaged chip (chip carrier), consisting of the IC in a plastic or ceramic enclosure and connected to the package leads, constitutes the \ufb01 rst level of packaging. \rPackaged chips and other components are assembled to a printed circuit board (PCB) using two technologies (Section 33.6.1): (1) surface-mount technology (SMT) \r\rFIGURE 34.1 \r\rPackaging hierarchy in a large electronic system. \rLevel 0 \rLevel 1 \rLevel 2 \rPrinted circuit board \rLevel 3 \rCabinet and system \rLevel 4 \r\rand (2) through-hole technology, also known as pin-in-hole (PIH) technology.Today, SMT is much more widely used in industry, especially for mass-produced products. The chip package styles and assembly techniques are different for SMT and PIH. In many cases, both assembly technologies are employed in the same board. Printed circuit board assembly represents the second level of packaging. Figure 34.2 shows two PCB assemblies, illustrating both PIH and SMT types. Note the smaller component sizes of the SMT board. \rTABLE \u2022 34.1 Packaging hierarchy. \r\r\r\rFIGURE 34.2 Two printed circuit boardassemblies.

In boards consisting of more than one layer, copper conducting paths are interleaved between the layers. PCBs are used in packaged electronic systems to hold components, provide electrical interconnections among them, and make connections to external circuits. They have become standard building blocks in virtually all electronic systems that contain packaged ICs and other components (Historical Note 34.1). PCBs are so important and widely used because (1) they provide a convenient structural platform for the components; (2) a board with correctly routed interconnections can be mass produced consistently, without the variability usually associated with hand wiring; (3) nearly all of the soldering connections between components and the PCB can be accomplished in a one-step mechanized \rHistorical Note 34.1 Printed circuit boards \rBefore printed circuit boards, electrical and electronic components were manually fastened to a sheet-metal chassis (usually aluminum) and then hand wired and soldered to form the desired circuit. This was called point-to-point construction. In the late 1950s, various plastic boards became commercially available. These boards, which provided electrical insulation, gradually replaced the aluminum chassis. The \ufb01 rst plastics were phenolics, followed by glass-\ufb01 ber-reinforced epoxies. The boards came with predrilled holes spaced at standard intervals in both directions. This motivated the use of electronic components that matched these hole spacings. The dual-in-line package evolved during this period. \rThe components in these circuit boards were hand-wired, which proved increasingly dif\ufb01 cult and prone to human error as component densities increased and circuits became more complex. The printed circuit board, with etched copper foil on its surface to form the wiring interconnections, was developed in the 1950s to solve these problems with manual wiring. The printed circuit boards during that period used through-hole technology, and PCBs had to be drilled to accommodate the component leads. The original technique for \u201cprinting\u201d the circuit pattern onto the copper-clad board was screen printing. In the late 1980s, surface mount technology began to replace through-hole construction. SMT did not require lead holes, and the components were signi\ufb01 cantly smaller, allowing much higher circuit densities to be achieved on the printed circuit boards. As track widths became \ufb01 ner and \ufb01 ner, photolithography was substituted for screen printing. \rInitial techniques to design the circuit masks involved a manual inking procedure, in which the designer attempted to route the conducting tracks to provide the required connections and avoid short circuits on a large sheet of paper or vellum. This became more dif\ufb01 cult as the number of components on the board increased and the conducting lines interconnecting the components became \ufb01 ner. Computer programs were developed to aid the designer in solving the routing problem. However, in many cases, it was impossible to \ufb01 nd a solution with no intersecting tracks (short circuits). To solve the problem, jumper wires were hand-soldered to the board to make these connections. As the number of jumper wires increased, the problem of human error again appeared. Multilayer printed circuit boards were introduced to deal with this routing issue. \r\r\roperation, (4) an assembled PCB gives reliable performance; and (5) in complex electronic systems, each assembled PCB can be detached from the system for service, repair, or replacement. \r\r34.2.1 STRUCTURES, TYPES, AND MATERIALS FOR PCBs \rA printed circuit board (PCB), also called a printed wiring board (PWB), is a laminated \ufb02at panel of insulating material designed to provide electrical interconnections between electronic components attached to it.

Interconnections are made by thin conducting paths on the surface of the board or in alternating layers sandwiched between layers of insulating material. The conducting paths are made of copper and are called tracks. Other copper areas, called lands, are also available on the board surface for attaching and electrically connecting components. \rInsulation materials in PCBs are usually polymer composites reinforced with glass fabrics or paper. Polymers include epoxy (most widely used), phenolic, and polyimide. E-glass is the usual \ufb01ber in glass-reinforcing fabrics, especially in epoxy PCBs; cotton paper is a common reinforcing layer for phenolic boards. The usual thickness of the substrate layer is 0.8 to 3.2 mm (0.031\u20130.125 in), and copper foil thickness is around 0.04 mm (0.0015 in). The materials forming the PCB structure must be electrically insulating, strong and rigid, resistant to warpage, dimensionally stable, heat resistant, and \ufb02ame retardant. Chemicals are often added to the polymer \r\r\rcomposite to obtain the last two characteristics. \rThere are three principal types of printed circuit board, shown in Figure 34.3: \r(a) single-sided board, in which copper foil is only on one side of the insulation substrate; (b) double-sided board, in which the copper foil is on both sides of the substrate; and (c) multilayer board, consisting of alternating layers of conducting foil and insulation. In all three structures, the insulation layers are constructed of multiple laminates of epoxy-glass sheets (or other composite) bonded together to form a strong and rigid structure. Multilayer boards are used for complex circuit assemblies in which a large number of components must be interconnected with many track routings, thus requiring more conducting paths than can be accommodated in one or two copper layers. Four layers is the most common multilayer con\ufb01 guration, but boards with up to 24 conducting layers are produced. \r\r34.2.2 PRODUCTION OF THE STARTING BOARDS \rSingle-and double-sided boards can be purchased from suppliers that specialize in mass producing them in standard sizes. The boards are then custom-processed by a circuit fabricator to create the speci\ufb01ed circuit pattern and board size for a given application. Multilayer boards are fabricated from standard single-and double-sided boards. The circuit fabricator processes the boards separately to form the required circuit pattern for each layer in the \ufb01nal structure, and then the individual boards are bonded together with additional layers of epoxy-fabric. Processing of multilayer boards is more involved and more expensive than the other types; the reason for using them is that they provide better performance for large systems than using a much greater number of lower-density boards of simpler construction. \rThe copper foil used to clad the starting boards is produced by a continuous electroforming process (Section 27.3.2), in which a rotating smooth metal drum is partially submersed in an electrolytic bath containing copper ions. The drum is the cathode in the circuit,causing the copper to plate onto its surface.As the drum rotates out of the bath, the thin copper foil is peeled from its surface. The process is ideal for producing the very thin copper foil needed for PCBs. \rProduction of the starting boards consists of pressing multiple sheets of woven glass \ufb01ber that have been impregnated with partially cured epoxy (or other thermosetting polymer).The number of sheets used in the starting sandwich determines the thickness of the \ufb01nal board. Copper foil is placed on one or both sides of the epoxy-glass laminated stack, depending on whether single- or double-sided boards are to be made. For single-sided boards, a thin release \ufb01lm is used on one side in place of the copper foil to prevent sticking of the epoxy in the press.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7371, "end_char_idx": 11931, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d1962f6-b107-486d-b1f9-2d826d8ed5b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d1962f6-b107-486d-b1f9-2d826d8ed5b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec34.txt", "file_name": "sec34.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58737, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5527045c-5e33-484d-b65a-1a653c29f387", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec34.txt", "file_name": "sec34.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58737, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "1beab0635d1b17c49fa817fdc00d39ba7c688563290c30cd70783500fcccc348", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d7d81f72-f7cd-444d-8e4e-606cff15d8eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec34.txt", "file_name": "sec34.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58737, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "cd73abdab84dfaa49643495f6433f3e41a86b3550575bec0fac53770041caa89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e88b608-9971-409d-8e9d-3b3b7d86ac8f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5ffb027265a23b4c90a9a9fed817ce108146e4eaa122ecada9457f9224d3ebe5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The drum is the cathode in the circuit,causing the copper to plate onto its surface.As the drum rotates out of the bath, the thin copper foil is peeled from its surface.

For single-sided boards, a thin release \ufb01lm is used on one side in place of the copper foil to prevent sticking of the epoxy in the press. Pressing is accomplished between two steam-heated platens of a hydraulic press.The combination of heat and pressure compacts and cures the epoxy-glass layers to bond and harden the laminates into a single-piece board. The board is then cooled and trimmed to remove excess epoxy that has been squeezed out around the edges. \rThe completed board consists of a glass-fabric-reinforced epoxy panel, clad with copper over its surface area on one or both sides. It is now ready for the circuit fabricator. Panels are usually produced in large standard widths designed to match the board handling systems on wave-soldering equipment, automatic insertion machines, and other PCB processing and assembly facilities. If the electronic design calls for a smaller size, several units can be processed together on the same larger board and then separated later. \r\r\r34.2.3 PROCESSES USED IN PCB FABRICATION \rThe circuit fabricator employs a variety of processing operations to produce a \ufb01 nished PCB, ready for assembly of components. The operations include cleaning, shearing, hole drilling or punching, pattern imaging, etching, and electroless and electrolytic plating. Most of these processes have been discussed in earlier chapters. This section emphasizes the details that are relevant to PCB fabrication.The discussion proceeds approximately in the order in which the processes are performed on a board. However, there are differences in processing sequence between different board types, and these differences are examined in Section 34.2.4. Some of the operations in PCB fabrication must be performed under clean room conditions to avoid defects in the printed circuits, especially for boards with \ufb01ne tracks and details. \rBoard Preparation Initial preparation of the board consists of shearing, hole-making, and other shaping operations to create tabs, slots, and similar features in the board. If necessary, the starting panel may have to be sheared to size for compatibility with the circuit fabricator\u2019s equipment. The holes, called tooling holes, are made by drilling or punching and are used for positioning the board during subsequent processing. The sequence of fabrication steps requires close alignment from one process to the next, and these holes are used with locating pins at each operation to achieve accurate registration. Three tooling holes per board are usually suf\ufb01cient for this purpose; hole size is about 3.2 mm (0.125 in), larger than the circuit holes to be drilled later. \rThe board is typically bar coded for identi\ufb01cation purposes in this preparation phase. Finally, a cleaning process is used to remove dirt and grease from the board surface. Although cleanliness requirements are not as stringent as in IC fabrication, small particles of dirt and dust can cause defects in the circuit pattern of a printed circuit board; and surface \ufb01lms of grease can inhibit etching and other chemical processes. Cleanliness is essential for producing reliable PCBs. \r\rHole Drilling In addition to tooling holes, functional circuit holes are required in PCBs as (1) insertion holes for inserting leads of components that are based on through-hole technology, (2) via holes, which are later copper-plated and used as conducting paths from one side of the board to the other, and (3) holes to fasten certain components such as heat sinks and connectors to the board.

These holes are either drilled or punched, using the tooling holes for location. Cleaner holes can be produced by drilling, so most holes in PCB fabrication are drilled. A stack of three or four panels may be drilled in the same operation, using a computer numerically controlled (CNC) drill press that receives its programming instructions from the design database. For high-production jobs, multiple-spindle drills are sometimes used, permitting all of the holes in the board to be drilled in one feed motion. \rStandard twist drills (Section 22.3.2) are used to drill the holes, but the application makes a number of unusual demands on the drill and drilling equipment. Perhaps the biggest single problem is the small hole size in printed circuit boards; drill diameter is generally less than 1.27 mm (0.050 in), but some high-density boards require hole sizes of 0.15 mm (0.006 in) or even less [8]. Such small drill bits lack strength, and their capacity to dissipate heat is low. \rAnother dif\ufb01culty is the unique work material. The drill bit must \ufb01 rst pass through a thin copper foil and then proceed through an abrasive epoxy-glass composite. Different drills would normally be speci\ufb01 ed for these materials, but a single drill must suf\ufb01 ce in PCB drilling. Cemented carbide or coated carbide are favored over high speed steel as the tool material. \rThe small hole size, combined with the stacking of several boards or multilayer boards, result in a high depth-to-diameter ratio, aggravating the problem of chip extraction from the hole. Other requirements placed on the operation include high accuracy in hole location, smooth hole walls, and absence of burrs on the holes. Burrs are usually formed when the drill enters or exits a hole; thin sheets of material are often placed on top of and beneath the stack of boards to inhibit burr formation on the boards themselves. \rFinally, any cutting tool must be used at a certain cutting speed to operate at best ef\ufb01 ciency. For a drill bit, cutting speed is measured at the diameter. For very small drill sizes, this means extremely high rotational speeds\u2014up to 100,000 rev/min in some cases. Special spindle bearings and motors are required to achieve these speeds. \rCircuit Pattern Imaging and Etching There are two basic methods by which the circuit pattern is transferred to the copper surface of the board: screen printing and photolithography. Both methods involve the use of a resist coating on the board surface that determines where etching of the copper will occur to create the tracks and lands of the circuit. \rScreen printing was the \ufb01 rst method used for PCBs. It is indeed a printing technique, and the term printed circuit board can be traced to this method. In screen printing, a stencil screen containing the circuit pattern is placed on the board, and liquid resist is squeezed through the mesh to the surface beneath.This method is simple and inexpensive, but its resolution is limited. It is normally used only for applications in which track widths are greater than about 0.25 mm (0.010 in). \rThe second method of transferring the circuit pattern is photolithography, in which a light-sensitive resist material is exposed through a mask to transfer the circuit pattern. The procedure is similar to the corresponding process in IC fabrication (Section 33.3.1); some of the details in PCB processing will be described here. \rPhotoresists used by circuit fabricators are available in two forms: liquid or dry \ufb01lm. Liquid resists can be applied by roller or spraying. Dry \ufb01lm resists are more commonly used in PCB fabrication. They consist of three layers: a \ufb01lm of photosensitive polymer sandwiched between a polyester support sheet on one side and a removable plastic cover sheet on the other side. The cover sheet prevents the photosensitive material from sticking during storage and handling. Although more expensive than liquid resists, dry \ufb01lm resists form coatings of uniform thickness, and their processing in photolithography is simpler. To apply, the cover sheet is removed, and the resist \ufb01lm is placed on the copper surface to which it readily adheres. Hot rollers are used to press and smooth the resist onto the surface.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 14911, "end_char_idx": 19514, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57902313-02ae-47a5-b3e9-41858c1d3509": {"__data__": {"id_": "57902313-02ae-47a5-b3e9-41858c1d3509", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec34.txt", "file_name": "sec34.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58737, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5527045c-5e33-484d-b65a-1a653c29f387", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec34.txt", "file_name": "sec34.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58737, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "1beab0635d1b17c49fa817fdc00d39ba7c688563290c30cd70783500fcccc348", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e88b608-9971-409d-8e9d-3b3b7d86ac8f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec34.txt", "file_name": "sec34.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58737, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "d4c5ffae5b0dc6378187b6b6ea865e13c81f6dcc8367126527af2dbc23af1023", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3f2b36a3-5245-441b-abbe-3a23b8b038d2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b1b0cd6024f8880ee452d199ff3b9815f5d672b391f27b47166a2c787fb9220", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Photoresists used by circuit fabricators are available in two forms: liquid or dry \ufb01lm.

To apply, the cover sheet is removed, and the resist \ufb01lm is placed on the copper surface to which it readily adheres. Hot rollers are used to press and smooth the resist onto the surface. \rAlignment of the masks relative to the board relies on the use of registration holes that are aligned with the tooling holes on the board. Contact printing is used to expose the resist beneath the mask. The resist is then developed, which involves removal of the unexposed regions of the negative resist from the surface. \rAfter resist development, certain areas of the copper surface remain covered by resist while other areas are now unprotected. The covered areas correspond to circuit tracks and lands, while uncovered areas correspond to open regions between. Etching removes the copper cladding in the unprotected regions from the board surface, usually by means of a chemical etchant. Etching is the step that transforms the solid copper \ufb01lm into the interconnections for an electrical circuit. \rEtching is done in an etching chamber in which the etchant is sprayed onto the surface of the board that is now partially coated with resist. Various etchants are used to remove copper, including ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O4), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), cupric chloride (CuCl2), and ferric chloride (FeCl3). Each has its relative advantages and disadvantages. Process parameters (e.g., temperature, etchant concentration, and duration) must be closely controlled to avoid over- or under-etching, as in IC fabrication. After etching, the board must be rinsed and the remaining resist chemically stripped from the surface. \rPlating In printed circuit boards, plating is needed on the hole surfaces to provide conductive paths from one side to the other in double-sided boards, or between layers in multilayer boards.Two types of plating process are used in PCB fabrication:electroplating and electroless plating (Section 27.3). Electroplating has a higher deposition rate than electroless plating but requires that the coated surface be metallic (conductive). Electroless plating is slower but does not require a conductive surface. \rAfter drilling of the via holes and insertion holes, the walls of the holes consist of epoxy-glass insulation material, which is nonconductive. Accordingly, electroless plating must be used initially to provide a thin coating of copper on the hole walls. Once the thin \ufb01lm of copper has been applied, electrolytic plating is then used to increase coating thickness on the hole surfaces to between 0.025 and 0.05 mm (0.001 and 0.002 in). \rGold is another metal sometimes plated onto printed circuit boards. It is used as a very thin coating on PCB edge connectors to provide superior electrical contact. Coating thickness is only about 2.5 mm (0.0001 in). \r\r\r\rFIGURE 34.4 A section of a double-sided PCB, showing various features accomplished during fabrication: tracks and lands, and copper-plated insertion and via holes. \r\r34.2.4 PCB FABRICATION SEQUENCE \rThis section describes the processing sequence for various board types.The sequence is concerned with transforming a copper-clad board of reinforced polymer into a printed circuit board, a procedure called circuitization.

The process is called \u201csubtractive\u201d because copper is removed from the board surface. The steps in the subtractive method are described in Figure 34.5. \rThe additive method starts with a board surface that is not copper clad, such as the uncoated surface of a single-sided board. However, the uncoated surface is treated with a chemical, called a buttercoat, which acts as the catalyst for electroless plating. The steps in the method are outlined in Figure 34.6. \r\rFIGURE 34.5 The subtractive method of circuitization in PCB fabrication: (1) applyresist to areas not to be etched, using photo-lithography to exposethe areas that are to be etched, (2) etch, and\r(3) strip resist. \r\rThe semiadditive method uses a combination of additive and subtractive steps. The starting board has a very thin copper \ufb01lm on its surface\u20145 mm (0.0002 in) or less. The method proceeds as described in Figure 34.7. \rProcessing of Different Board Types Processing methods differ for the three PCB types: single-sided, double-sided, and multilayer. A single-sided board begins \r\r\rFIGURE 34.8 Typical cross section of a multilayer printed circuit board. \r\rBuried via hole \r\rInsulation layers \r\r\rfabrication as a \ufb02at sheet of insulating material clad on one side with copper \ufb01lm. The subtractive method is used to produce the circuit pattern in the copper cladding. \rA double-sided board involves a somewhat more complex processing sequence because it has circuit tracks on both sides that must be electrically connected. The interconnection is accomplished by means of copper-plated via holes that run from lands on one surface of the board to lands on the opposite surface, as shown in Figure 34.4. A typical fabrication sequence for a double-sided board (copperclad on both sides) uses the semiadditive method. After hole drilling, electroless plating is used to initially plate the holes, followed by electroplating to increase plating thickness. \rA multilayer board is structurally the most complex of the three types, and this complexity is re\ufb02ected in its manufacturing sequence.The laminated construction can be seen in Figure 34.8, which highlights some of the features of a multilayer PCB. The fabrication steps for the individual layers are basically the same as those used for single-and double-sided boards. What makes multilayer board fabrication more complicated is that (1) all of the layers, each with its own circuit design, must \ufb01rst be processed; then (2) the layers must be joined together to form one integral board; and \ufb01 nally (3) the assembled board must itself be put through its own processing sequence. \rA multilayer board consists of logic layers, which carry electrical signals between components on the board, and voltage layers, which are used to distribute power. Logic layers are generally fabricated from double-sided boards, whereas voltage layers are usually made from single-sided boards. Thinner insulating substrates are used for multi layer boards than for their standalone single- and double-sided counter parts, so that a suitable thickness of the \ufb01nal board can be achieved. \rIn the second stage, the individual layers are assembled together. The procedure starts with copper foil on the bottom outside, and then adds the individual layers, separating one from the next by one or more sheets of glass fabric impregnated with partially cured epoxy. After all layers have been sandwiched together, a \ufb01nal copper foil is placed on the stack to form the top outer layer.

The procedure starts with copper foil on the bottom outside, and then adds the individual layers, separating one from the next by one or more sheets of glass fabric impregnated with partially cured epoxy. After all layers have been sandwiched together, a \ufb01nal copper foil is placed on the stack to form the top outer layer. Layers are then bonded into a single board by heating the assembly under pressure to cure the epoxy.After curing, any excess resin squeezed out of the sandwich around the edges is trimmed away. \rAt the start of the third stage of fabrication, the board consists of multiple layers bonded together, with copper foil cladded on its outer surfaces. Its construction can therefore be likened to that of a double-sided board; and its processing is likewise similar. The sequence consists of drilling additional through-holes, plating the holes to establish conduction paths between the two exterior copper \ufb01lms as well as certain internal copper layers, and the use of photolithography and etching to form the circuit pattern on the outer copper surfaces. \r\rTesting and Finishing Operations After a circuit has been fabricated on the board surface, it must be inspected and tested to ensure that it functions according to design speci\ufb01cations and contains no quality defects. Two procedures are common: (1) visual inspection and (2) continuity testing. In visual inspection, the board is examined visually to detect open and short circuits, errors in drilled hole locations, and other faults that can be observed without applying electrical power to the board. Visual inspections, performed not only after fabrication but also at various critical stages during production, are accomplished by human eye or machine vision (Section 40.6.3). \rContinuity testing involves the use of contact probes brought simultaneously into contact with track and land areas on the board surface.The setup consists of an array of probes that are forced under light pressure to make contact with speci\ufb01ed points on the board surface. Electrical connections between contact points can be quickly checked in this procedure. \rSeveral additional processing steps must be performed on the bare board to prepare it for assembly.The \ufb01rst of these \ufb01nishing operations is the application of a thin solder layer on the track and land surfaces. This layer serves to protect the copper from oxidation and contamination. It is carried out either by electroplating or by bringing the copper side into contact with rotating rollers that are partially submersed in molten solder. \rA second operation involves application of a coating of solder resist to all areas of the board surface except the lands that are to be subsequently soldered in assembly. The solder resist coating is chemically formulated to resist adhesion of solder; thus, in the subsequent soldering processes, solder adheres only to land areas. Solder resist is usually applied by screen printing. \rFinally, an identi\ufb01cation legend is printed onto the surface, again by screen printing. The legend indicates where the different components are to be placed on the board in \ufb01nal assembly. In modern industrial practice, a bar code is also printed on the board for production control purposes. \r\r\r\rPrinted Circuit Board Assembly \rA printed circuit board assembly consists of electronic components (e.g., IC packages, resistors, capacitors) as well as mechanical components (e.g., fasteners, heat sinks) mounted on a printed circuit board. This is level 2 in electronic packaging (Table 34.1). As indicated, PCB assembly is based on either surface-mount technology (SMT) or through-hole technology (see Figure 34.2).

As indicated, PCB assembly is based on either surface-mount technology (SMT) or through-hole technology (see Figure 34.2). Some PCB assemblies include both SMT and through-hole components. The discussion in this section covers both categories as well as combinations of the two. The scope of electronic assembly also includes higher packaging levels such as assemblies of multiple PCBs electrically connected and mechanically contained in a chassis or cabinet. Section 34.4 explores the technologies by which electrical connections are made at these higher levels. \r\r34.3.1 SURFACE MOUNT TECHNOLOGY \rSince the late 1980s, the use of surface mount technology has grown to the point where it is now the dominant process in printed circuit board assembly. The earlier through-hole technology has the following inherent limitations in terms of packing density: (1) components can be mounted on only one side of the board, and (2) centerto-center distance between lead pins in leaded components must be a minimum of \r\r1.0 mm (0.04 in) and is usually 2.5 mm (0.10 in). \rSurface-mount technology uses an assembly method in which component leads are soldered to lands on the surface of the board rather than into holes running through the board (Historical Note 34.2). By eliminating the need for leads inserted into through holes in the board, several advantages are gained: (1) smaller components are available, with leads closer together; (2) circuit densities can be increased; \r(3) components can be mounted on both sides of the board; (4) smaller PCBs can be used for the same electronic system; and (5) drilling of the many through holes during board fabrication is eliminated although via holes to interconnect layers are still required [6]. Typical areas on the board surface taken by SMT components range between 20% and 60% compared to through-hole components. \rHistorical Note 34.2 Surface-mount technology \rPrinted circuit board assemblies based on through-hole technology were the predominant electronics packaging method from the 1950s through most of the 1980s, when surface-mount technology (SMT) started to be widely used. \rSMT traces its origins to the electronic systems in the aerospace and military industries of the 1960s, with the IBM Corporation responsible for much of the original development work. The \ufb01 rst components were small, \ufb02 at ceramic packages with gull-wing leads. The initial reason why these packages were attrac tive, compared with through-hole technology, was the fact that they could be placed on both sides of a printed circuit board\u2014in effect, doubling the component density. In addition, the SMT package could be made smaller than a comparable through-hole package, further increasing component densities on the printed circuit board. \rIn the early 1970s, further advances in SMT were made in the form of leadless components\u2014components with ceramic packages that had no discrete leads. This permitted even greater circuit densities in military and aerospace electronics. In the late 1970s, plastic SMT packages became available, motivating the widespread use of surface-mount technology. The computer and automotive industries have become important users of SMT, and their demand for SMT components has contributed to the signi\ufb01cant growth in this technology. \r\rDespite its advantages,SMT has not been fully adopted by the electronics industry to the exclusion of through-hole technology.There are several reasons for this:(1) Owing to their smaller size, surface mount components are more dif\ufb01cult to handle and assemble by humans; (2) inspection, testing, and rework of the circuit assemblies are generally more dif\ufb01cult in SMT because of the smaller scale involved; and (3) certain types of components are not available in surface-mount form. This \ufb01nal limitation results in some electronic assemblies that contain both surface-mount and leaded components. \rThe sequence of steps to produce assembled PCBs is basically the same in SMT and through-hole technology: (1) place the components on the PCB, (2) solder the components to the PCB lands,(3) clean the assembly,(4) inspect,(5) test,and (6) rework.The details of the \ufb01rst two steps differ for SMT and through-hole technology.The \ufb01nal four steps are the same, except that the smaller scale of SMT makes inspection, testing, and rework more challenging. \rComponent placement in SMT means correctly locating the component on the PCB and af\ufb01xing it suf\ufb01ciently to the surface until soldering provides permanent mechanical and electrical connections.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 29629, "end_char_idx": 34224, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9bb422b-2203-4567-b2b3-11046b10dfba": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9bb422b-2203-4567-b2b3-11046b10dfba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec34.txt", "file_name": "sec34.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58737, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5527045c-5e33-484d-b65a-1a653c29f387", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec34.txt", "file_name": "sec34.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58737, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "1beab0635d1b17c49fa817fdc00d39ba7c688563290c30cd70783500fcccc348", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f4e2d622-376a-4533-8138-b81436473af6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec34.txt", "file_name": "sec34.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58737, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4c013f9ac58474ace2f0cd4d12a724fdec5b40803dce99e89de14b6e0b1867df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "139f1d91-98b2-4afc-912b-40b8154bd10e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "86edf141873bbfbf081e7a2d1f9355b63174dd3a7ffac005211b6b0d10c18d28", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "This \ufb01nal limitation results in some electronic assemblies that contain both surface-mount and leaded components. \rThe sequence of steps to produce assembled PCBs is basically the same in SMT and through-hole technology: (1) place the components on the PCB, (2) solder the components to the PCB lands,(3) clean the assembly,(4) inspect,(5) test,and (6) rework.The details of the \ufb01rst two steps differ for SMT and through-hole technology.The \ufb01nal four steps are the same, except that the smaller scale of SMT makes inspection, testing, and rework more challenging. \rComponent placement in SMT means correctly locating the component on the PCB and af\ufb01xing it suf\ufb01ciently to the surface until soldering provides permanent mechanical and electrical connections. Two alternative placement and soldering methods are available: (1) solder paste and re\ufb02ow soldering, and (2) adhesive bonding of components and wave soldering. It turns out that certain types of SMT components are more suited to one method whereas other types are more suited to the other method. \r\rSolder Paste and Re\ufb02ow Soldering The steps in this method are described in Figure 34.9. A solder paste is used to af\ufb01x components to the surface of the circuit board. A solder paste is a suspension of solder powders in a \ufb02ux binder. It has three functions: (1) it is the solder\u2014typically 80% to 90% of total paste volume, (2) it is the \ufb02ux, and (3) it is the adhesive that temporarily secures the components to the surface of the board. Methods of applying the solder paste to the board surface include screen printing and syringe dispensing. Properties of the paste must be compatible with these application methods; the paste must \ufb02ow yet not be so liquid that it spreads beyond the localized area where it is applied. \rAfter solder paste application, the components are placed onto the board surface by automated placement machines or semiautomatic placement machines.The automatic machines operate under computer numerical control (Section 37.3). Components (e.g., chip carriers, capacitors, resistors) to be placed are usually supplied in magazines or attached to tape in reels that can be loaded into feeders on the automated machines. The starting blank PCB is moved and positioned under the pick-and-place work head that places the components at speci\ufb01ed locations on the board using a high-speed x-y positioning system. The work head uses suction nozzles to retrieve and handle components. Automated machines operate at cycle rates of up to 30,000 components per hour [20]. For mass production, they are frequently integrated into production lines, so that most or all of the processes performed on the board during assembly are completed in one automated sequence. \rThe semiautomatic machines assist a worker in the placement operation using a high-resolution vision system. Components to be placed are presented to the operator in the correct placement sequence by a turret mechanism, and then the operator picks the component and is guided by the vision monitor to place it at the target \r\r\r(1) adhesive is applied to areas on the board where components are to be placed; (2) components are placed ontoadhesive-coated areas; (3) adhesive is cured; and (4) solder joints are made by wave soldering. \rlocation on the board. Cycle rates of 1,000 components per hour are claimed for some semiautomatic machines [15]. \rAfter all components are placed on the board, a low-temperature baking operation is performed to dry the \ufb02ux binder; this reduces gas escape during soldering. Finally, the solder re\ufb02ow process (Section 30.2.3) heats the solder paste suf\ufb01ciently that the solder particles melt to form a high-quality mechanical and electrical joint between the component leads and the circuit lands on the board. \rAdhesive Bonding and Wave Soldering The sequence of steps is depicted in Figure 34.10. Various adhesives (Section 30.3) are used for af\ufb01xing components to the board surface.Most common are epoxies and acrylics.The adhesive is applied by one of three methods: (1) brushing liquid adhesive through a screen stencil; (2) using an automatic dispensing machine with a programmable x-y positioning system; or \r(3) using a pin transfer method, in which a \ufb01xture consisting of pins arranged according to where adhesive must be applied is dipped into the liquid adhesive and then positioned onto the board surface to deposit adhesive in the required spots.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 33467, "end_char_idx": 37893, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "139f1d91-98b2-4afc-912b-40b8154bd10e": {"__data__": {"id_": "139f1d91-98b2-4afc-912b-40b8154bd10e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec34.txt", "file_name": "sec34.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58737, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5527045c-5e33-484d-b65a-1a653c29f387", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec34.txt", "file_name": "sec34.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58737, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "1beab0635d1b17c49fa817fdc00d39ba7c688563290c30cd70783500fcccc348", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e9bb422b-2203-4567-b2b3-11046b10dfba", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec34.txt", "file_name": "sec34.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58737, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "4213f5a6b774ab2de36482d6b1a42ad0e2c5d3e6a55ef4da05e8a6fa4467e947", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "21f0464c-f4d5-4802-bcbf-f83b9568bb37", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "607a6ec108905b7c409dc6bf327c81826db9c751d73bf848ce3588abd6a59e4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Adhesive Bonding and Wave Soldering The sequence of steps is depicted in Figure 34.10.

After component placement, the adhesive is cured. Depending on adhesive type, curing is by heat, ultraviolet (UV) light, or a combination of UV and infrared (IR) radiation.With the surface-mount components now bonded to the PCB surface,the board is put through wave soldering.The components themselves passthrough the molten solder wave.Technicalproblemssometimes encountered in SMT wave soldering include components uprooted from the board, components shifting position, and larger components creating shadows that inhibit proper soldering of neighboring components. \r\r34.3.2 THROUGH-HOLE TECHNOLOGY \rIn printed circuit assemblies using through-hole technology, the lead pins must be inserted into through-holes in the circuit board. Once inserted, the leads are soldered into place in the holes in the board. In double-sided and multilayer boards, the hole surfaces into which the leads are inserted are generally copper plated, giving rise to the name plated through-hole for these cases.After soldering, the boards are cleaned and tested, and those boards not passing the test are reworked if possible. \rComponent Insertion In component insertion, the leads of components are inserted into their proper through-holes in the PCB. In PCB assemblies based exclusively on through-hole technology (unusual today), a single board may be populated with hundreds of separate components (DIPs, resistors, etc.), all of which need to be inserted into the board. In modern electronic assembly plants, most component insertions are accomplished by automatic insertion machines. Components are loaded into these machines in the form of reels, magazines, or other carriers that maintain proper orientation of the components until insertion. A small proportion is done by hand for nonstandard components that cannot be accommodated on automatic machines. These cases include switches and connectors as well as resistors, capacitors, and certain other components. Although the proportion of component insertions accomplished manually is low, their cost is high because of much lower cycle rates than automatic insertions. Industrial robots (Section 37.4) are sometimes used to substitute for human labor in these component insertion tasks. \rThe insertion operation involves (1) preforming the leads, (2) insertion of leads into the board holes, and then (3) cropping and clinching the leads on the other side of the board. Preforming is needed only for some component types and involves bending of leads that are initially straight into a U-shape for insertion. Many components come with properly shaped leads and require little or no preforming. \rInsertion is accomplished by a work head designed for the component type. Components inserted by automatic machines are grouped into three basic categories: (a) axial lead, (b) radial lead, and (c) chip carrier (e.g., dual-in-line package, Section 33.6.1). Typical axial and radial lead components are pictured in Figure 34.11. Axial components are shaped like a cylinder, with leads projecting from each end. Typical components of this type include resistors, capacitors, and diodes. Their leads must be bent, as suggested in the \ufb01gure, to be inserted. Radial components have parallel leads and have various body shapes, one of which is shown in Figure 34.11(b). This type of component includes light-emitting diodes, potentiometers, resistor networks, and fuse holders.

Accurate positioning of the board beneath the work head before each insertion is performed by a high-speed x-y positioning table. \rOnce the leads have been inserted through the holes in the board, they are clinched and cropped. Clinching involves bending the leads, as in Figure 34.12, to mechanically secure the component to the board until soldering. If this were not done, the component is at risk of being knocked out of its holes during handling. In cropping, the leads are cut to proper length; otherwise, there is a possibility that they might become bent and cause a short circuit with nearby circuit tracks or components. These operations are performed automatically on the underside of the board by the insertion machine. \rThe three types of insertion machines, corresponding to the three basic component con\ufb01gurations, can be joined to form an integrated circuit board assembly line. The integration is accomplished by means of a conveyor system that transfers boards from one machine type to the next. A computer control system is used to track the progress of each board as it moves through the cell and download the correct programs to each workstation. \rSoldering The second basic step in PCB assembly is soldering. For inserted components, the most important soldering techniques are wave soldering and hand soldering. These methods as well as other aspects of soldering are discussed in Section 30.2. \rWave soldering is a mechanized technique in which printed circuit boards containing inserted components are moved by conveyor over a standing wave of molten solder (Figure 30.9). The position of the conveyor is such that only the underside of the board, with component leads projecting through the holes, is in contact with the solder. The combination of capillary action and the upward force of the wave cause the liquid solder to \ufb02ow into the clearances between leads and through-holes to obtain a good solder joint. The tremendous advantage of wave soldering is that all of the solder joints on a board are made in a single pass through the process. \rHand soldering involves a skilled operator using a soldering iron to make circuit connections. Compared with wave soldering, hand soldering is slow since solder joints are made one at a time.As a production method,it is generally used only for small lot production and rework.As with other manual tasks,human error can result in quality problems. Hand soldering is sometimes used after wave soldering to add delicate components that would be damaged in the harsh environment of the wave-soldering chamber. Manual soldering has certain advantages in PCB assembly that should be noted: (1) Heat is localized and can be directed at a small target area; (2) equipment is inexpensive compared with wave soldering; and (3) energy consumption is considerably less. \r\r\r\rSMT component Through-Solder paste\r\rFIGURE 34.13 Typical \rholes \rprocess sequence for Land combined SMT-PIH assemblies with components on same side of \r(1) (2) (3)\r\rboard: (1) apply solder paste on lands for SMT components, (2) place \r\rPIH componentSMT components on the board, (3) bake, (4) re\ufb02ow solder, (5) insert PIH components, and (6) wave solder PIH components.

These cases are unusual because most SMT circuit assemblies combine surface-mounted and pin-in-hole components on the same board. In addition, SMT assemblies can be populated on both sides of the board, whereas PIH components are normally limited to one side only.The assembly sequence must be altered to allow for these additional possibilities, although the basic processing steps described in the two preceding sections are the same. \rOne possibility is for the SMT and through-hole components to be on the same side of the board. For this case, a typical sequence would consist of the steps described in Figure 34.13. More complex PCB assemblies consist of SMT-PIH components as in the \ufb01gure, but with SMT components on both sides of the board. \r\r\r34.3.4 CLEANING, INSPECTION, TESTING, AND REWORK \rAfter the components have been connected to the board, the assembly must be cleaned, inspected for solder faults, circuit tested, and reworked if necessary. \rCleaning After soldering, contaminants are present on the printed circuit assembly. These foreign substances include \ufb02ux, oil and grease, salts, and dirt, some of which can cause chemical degradation of the assembly or interfere with its electronic functions. One or more chemical cleaning operations (Section 27.1.1) must be performed to remove these undesirable materials. Traditional cleaning methods for PCB assemblies include hand cleaning with appropriate solvents and vapor degreasing with chlorinated solvents. Concern over environmental hazards in recent years has motivated the search for effective water-based solvents to replace the chlorinated and \ufb02uorinated chemicals traditionally used in vapor degreasing. \rInspection After cleaning, the PCB assembly is inspected for defective solder joints. Inspection of soldering quality is somewhat more dif\ufb01cult for surface-mount circuits (SMCs) because these assemblies are generally more densely packed, the solder joints are smaller, and joint geometries are different from those in through-hole assemblies. One of the problems is the way surface mount components are held in place during soldering. In through-hole assembly, the components are mechanically fastened in place by clinched leads. In SMT assembly, components are held by solder paste or adhesive.At soldering temperatures this method of attachment is not as secure, and components sometimes shift. Another problem with the smaller sizes in SMT is a greater likelihood of solder bridges forming between adjacent leads, resulting in short circuits. \r\rVisual inspection is used to detect for board substrate damage, missing or damaged components, soldering faults, and similar quality defects that can be observed by eye. Machine vision systems are being used to perform these inspections automatically in a growing number of installations. \rTesting Test procedures must be performed on the completed assembly to verify its functionality.The board design must allow for this testing by including test points in the circuit layout. These test points are convenient locations in the circuit where probes can make contact for testing. Individual components in the circuit are tested by contacting the component leads, applying input test signals, and measuring the output signals. More sophisticated procedures include digital function tests, in which the entire circuit or major subcircuits are tested using a programmed sequence of input signals and measuring the corresponding output signals to simulate operating conditions. \rAnother test used for printed circuit board assemblies is the substitution test, in which a production unit is plugged into a mock-up of the working system and energized to perform its functions. If the assembly performs in a satisfactory way, it is deemed as passing the test. It is then unplugged, and the next production unit is substituted in the mock-up.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 44786, "end_char_idx": 49266, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e27b04c-69a8-4991-b58e-6ebdd409453b": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e27b04c-69a8-4991-b58e-6ebdd409453b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec34.txt", "file_name": "sec34.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58737, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5527045c-5e33-484d-b65a-1a653c29f387", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec34.txt", "file_name": "sec34.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58737, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "1beab0635d1b17c49fa817fdc00d39ba7c688563290c30cd70783500fcccc348", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c458ad4c-1141-40a5-89f3-a52f451e7676", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec34.txt", "file_name": "sec34.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 58737, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "68ad36a4493b7b8180ce261ae4065ec9a46b569a8434d085a40129b662dd6458", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "415f0931-35aa-4ef9-8d46-18989ec6e274", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f050329741b9cd1057484fadaded4f430102bb1a75e03fceb6f1423ef0e1f18", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Testing Test procedures must be performed on the completed assembly to verify its functionality.The board design must allow for this testing by including test points in the circuit layout.

Burn-in tests operate the assemblies under power for a certain period of time, such as 24 or 72 hours, sometimes at elevated temperatures, such as 40C (100F), to force these defects to manifest their failures during the testing period. Boards not subject to infant mortality will survive this test and provide long service life. \rThe smaller scale of SMT poses problems in circuit testing because less space is available around each component. Contact probes must be physically smaller and more probes are required because SMT assemblies are more densely populated. One way of dealing with this issue is to design the circuit layout with extra lands whose only purpose is to provide a test probe contact site. Unfortunately, including these test lands runs counter to the goal of achieving higher packing densities on the SMT board. \rRework When inspection and testing indicate that one or more components on the board are defective, or certain solder joints are faulty, it usually makes sense to try to repair the assembly rather than discard it together with all of the other components that are not defective. This repair step is an integral part of electronic assembly plant operations. Common rework tasks include touchup (repair of solder faults), replacement of defective or missing components, and repair of copper \ufb01lm that has lifted from the substrate surface. These tasks are manual operations, requiring skilled workers using soldering irons. Rework of surface-mount assemblies is more dif\ufb01cult than in conventional PIH assemblies, again because of the smaller component sizes. Special tools are required, such as small-bit soldering irons, magnifying devices, and instruments for grasping and manipulating the small parts. \r\r\r\rElectrical Connector Technology \rPCB assemblies must be connected to back planes, and into racks and cabinets, and these cabinets must be connected to other cabinets and systems by means of cables. The growing use of electronics in so many types of products has made electrical connections an important technology. The performance of any electronic system depends on the reliability of the individual connections linking the components of the system together. This section is concerned with connector technology that is usually applied at the third and higher levels of electronics packaging. \rTo begin, there are two basic methods of making electrical connections: (1) soldering and (2) pressure connections. Soldering was discussed in Section 30.2 and throughout the current chapter. It is the most widely used technology in electronics. Pressure connections are electrical connections in which mechanical forces are used to establish electrical continuity between components. They can be divided into two types: permanent and separable. \r\r34.4.1 PERMANENT CONNECTIONS \rFIGURE 34.14 Some of the terminal stylesavailable for makingseparable electricalconnections: (a) slottedtongue, (b) ring tongue,and (c) \ufb02anged spade. \rA permanent connection involves high-pressure contact between two metal surfaces, in which one or both parts are mechanically deformed during the assembly process. Permanent connection methods include crimping, press \ufb01t technology, and insulation displacement. \rCrimping of Connector Terminals This connection method is used to assemble wire to electrical terminals. Although assembly of the wire to the terminal forms a permanent joint, the terminal itself is designed to be connected and disconnected to its mating component.

Crimping involves the mechanical deformation of the terminal barrel to form a permanent connection with the stripped end of a wire inserted into it. The crimping operation squeezes and closes the barrel around the bare wire. Crimping is performed by hand tools or crimping machines.The terminals are supplied either as individual pieces or on long strips that can be fed into a crimping machine. Properly accomplished, the crimped joint will have low electrical resistance and high mechanical strength. \rWire \r\r(a) (b) (c) \r\rFIGURE 34.16 \rInsulation displacement method of joining a connector contact to \ufb02at wire cable: (1) starting position, (2) contacts pierce insulation, and \r(3) after connection. \r\rPin \r\rPrinted circuit\rPlated (metal) board\rthrough hole \r\rFIGURE 34.15 Two types of terminal pins in electronics press \ufb01t technology: (a) solid \r(a) (b)\r\rand (b) compliant. \rPress Fit Technology Press \ufb01 t in electrical connections is similar to that in mechanical assembly, but the part con\ufb01gurations are different. Press \ufb01t technology is widely used in the electronics industry to assemble terminal pins into metal-plated through-holes in large PCBs. In that context, a press \ufb01 t involves an interference \ufb01t between the terminal pin and the plated hole into which it has been inserted. There are two categories ofterminal pins:(a) solid and (b)compliant,as in Figure 34.15.Within these categories, pin designs vary among suppliers. The solid pin is rectangular in cross section and is designed so that its corners press and even cut into the metal of the plated hole to form a good electrical connection. The compliant pin is designed as a spring-loaded device that conforms to the hole contour but presses against the walls of the hole to achieve electrical contact. \rInsulation Displacement Insulation displacement is a method of making a permanent electrical connection in which a sharp,prong-shaped contact pierces the insulation and squeezes against the wire conductor to form an electrical connection.The method is illustrated in Figure 34.16 and is commonly used to make simultaneous connections between multiple contacts and \ufb02at cable.The \ufb02at cable,called ribbon cable, consists of a number of parallel wires held in a \ufb01xed arrangement by the insulation surrounding them. It is often terminated in multiple pin connectors that are widely used in electronics to make electrical connections between major subassemblies.

Several terms have been applied to these miniaturized items. The term microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) emphasizes the miniaturization of systems consisting of both electronic and mechanical components. The word micromachines is sometimes used for these devices. Microsystem technology (MST) is a more general term that refers to the products (not necessarily limited to electromechanical products) as well as the fabrication technologies to produce them.A related term is nanotechnology, which refers to even smaller products whose dimensions are measured in nanometers (1 nm  103 mm  109 m). Figure 35.1 indicates the relative sizes and other factors associated with these terms. Microfabrication techniques are discussed in the current chapter and nanofabrication in Chapter 36. \r\r\r\r\r\rMicrosystem Products \rDesigning products that are smaller and comprised of even smaller parts and subassemblies means less material usage, lower power requirements, greater functionality per unit space, and accessibility to regions that are forbidden to larger products. In most cases, smaller products should mean lower prices because less material is used; however, the price of a given product is in\ufb02uenced by the costs of research, development, and production, and how these costs can be spread over the number of units sold. The economies of scale that result in lower-priced products have not yet fully been realized in microsystems technology, except for a limited number of cases that are examined in this section. \r\r\rElectron beam microscope  Optical microscope  Magnifying glass  Naked eye  \rScanning probe microscopes  \r\r\r\r35.1.1 TYPES OF MICROSYSTEM DEVICES \rMicrosystem products can be classi\ufb01ed by type of device (e.g., sensor, actuator) or by application area (e.g., medical, automotive). The device categories are as follows [1]: \r\u27a2 \rMicrosensors. A sensor is a device that detects or measures some physical phenomenon such as heat or pressure. It includes a transducer that converts one form of physical variable into another form (e.g., a piezoelectric device converts mechanical force into electrical current) plus the physical packaging and external connections. Most microsensors are fabricated on a silicon substrate using the same processing technologies as those used for integrated circuits (Chapter 33). Microscopic-sized sensors have been developed for measuring force, pressure, position, speed, acceleration, temperature, \ufb02ow, and a variety of optical, chemical, environmental,and biological variables.The term hybrid microsensor is often used when the sensing element (transducer) is combined with electronic components in the same device. \r\r\u27a2 \rMicroactuators. Like a sensor, an actuator converts a physical variable of one type into another type, but the converted variable usually involves some mechanical action (e.g., a piezoelectric device oscillating in response to an alternating electrical \ufb01eld). An actuator causes a change in position or the application of force. Examples of microactuators include valves, positioners, switches, pumps, and rotational and linear motors [1]. Figure 35.2 shows a microscopic ratchet mechanism fabricated of silicon. \r\r\u27a2 \rMicrostructures and microcomponents. These terms are used to denote a microsized part that is not a sensor or actuator. Examples of microstructures and microcomponents include microscopic gears, lenses, mirrors, nozzles, and beams. These items must be combined with other components (microscopic or otherwise) to provide a useful function. Figure 35.3 shows a microscopic gear alongside a human hair for comparison. \r\r\u27a2 \rMicrosystems and micro-instruments. These terms denote the integration of several of the preceding components together with the appropriate electronics \r\r\r\r\rFIGURE 35.2 \rMicroscopic ratchetmechanism fabricated of silicon (Photo courtesy of PaulMcWhorter). \rFIGURE 35.3 \rA microscopic gearand a human hair.

Microsystems and micro-instruments tend to be very application speci\ufb01c; for example, microlasers, optical chemical analyzers, and microspectrometers.

There are many problem areas that can be approached best using very small devices. Some important examples are the following: \rInk-Jet Printing Heads This is currently one of the largest applications of MST, because a typical ink-jet printer uses up several cartridges each year. The operation of an ink-jet printing head is depicted in Figure 35.4. An array of resistance heating elements is located above a corresponding array of nozzles. Ink is supplied by a reservoir and \ufb02ows between the heaters and nozzles. Each heating element can be independently activated under microprocessor control in microseconds. When activated by a pulse of current, the liquid ink immediately beneath the heater boils to form a vapor bubble, forcing ink to be expelled through the nozzle opening.The ink hits the paper and dries almost immediately to form a dot that is part of an alphanumeric character or other image. Meanwhile, the vapor bubble collapses, drawing more ink from the reservoir to replenish the supply. Today\u2019s ink-jet printers possess resolutions of 1200 dots per inch (dpi), which converts to a nozzle separation of only about 21 mm, certainly in the microsystem range. \rThin-Film Magnetic Heads Read-write heads are key components in magnetic storage devices. These heads were previously manufactured from horseshoe magnets that were manually wound with insulated copper wire. Because the reading and writing of magnetic media with higher-bit densities are limited by the size of the read-write head, hand-wound horseshoe magnets were a limitation on the technological trend toward greater storage densities. Development of thin-\ufb01lm magnetic heads at IBM Corporation was an important breakthrough in digital storage technology as well as a signi\ufb01cant success story for microfabrication technologies. Thin-\ufb01lm read-write heads are produced annually in hundreds of millions of units, with a market of several billions of dollars per year. \rA simpli\ufb01ed sketch of the read-write head is presented in Figure 35.5, showing its MSTparts.Thecopperconductorcoilsarefabricatedbyelectroplating copperthrough \rSubstrate \rThermal barrier \rResistance film \rConductor Resistance heater \rInk Nozzle plate \rInk drop \r\rFIGURE 35.5 Thin-\ufb01lm magnetic read-write head (simpli\ufb01ed). \r\r\ra resist mold.

The small sizes are made possible by microfabrication technologies. \rCompact Discs Compact discs (CDs) and digital versatile discs (DVDs)1 are important commercial products today, as storage media for audio, video, games, and computer software and data applications. A CD disk is molded of polycarbonate (Section 8.2.2), which has ideal optical and mechanical properties for the application.The disk is 120 mm in diameter and 1.2 mm thick.The data consists of small pits (depressions) in a helical track that begins at a diameter of 46 mm and ends at about 117 mm.The tracks in the spiral are separated by about 1.6 mm. Each pit in the track is about 0.5 mm wide and about 0.8 mm to 3.5 mm long. These dimensions certainly qualify CDs as products of microsystem technology. The corresponding dimensions of DVDs are even smaller, permitting much higher data storage capacities. \rAlthough most of the microfabrication processes are discussed in Section 35.2, the production sequence for CDs is brie\ufb02 y described here, because it is rather unique and uses several processes that are quite conventional.As consumer products,music CDs are mass-produced by plastic injection molding (Section 13.6). To make the mold, a master is created from a smooth, thin layer of positive photoresist coated onto a 300-mm diameter glass plate. A modulated laser beam writes the data onto the photoresist by exposing microscopic regions on the surface as the plate is rotated and moved slowly and precisely to create the spiral track. When the photoresist is developed, the exposed regions are removed. These regions in the master will correspond to the pits in the CD. A thin layer of nickel is then deposited onto the surface of the master by sputtering (Section 27.5.1). Electroforming (Section 27.3.2) is then used to build up the thickness of the nickel (to several mm), thus creating a negative impression of the master. This is called the \u201cfather.\u201d Several impressions are made of the father by the same electroforming process, in effect creating a negative impression \r1The DVD was originally called a digital video disc because its primary applications were motion picture videos. However, DVDs of various formats are now used for data storage and other computer applications, games, and high-quality audio. \rof the father, whose surface geometry is identical to the original glass plate master. These impressions are called \u201cmothers.\u201d Finally, the mothers are used to create the actual mold impressions (called \u201cstampers\u201d), again by electroforming, and these are used to mass-produce the CDs.2 The process sequence is similar for DVDs but more involved because of the smaller scale and different data format requirements. \rOnce molded, the pitted side of the polycarbonate disk is coated with aluminum by sputtering to create a mirror surface.To protect this layer,a thin polymer coating (e.g., acrylic) is deposited onto the metal. Thus, the \ufb01nal compact disk is a sandwich with a relatively thick polycarbonate substrate on one side, a thin polymer layer on the other side, and in between a very thin layer of aluminum. In subsequent operation, the laser beam of a CD player (or other data reader) is directed through the polycarbonate substrate onto the re\ufb02ective surface, and the re\ufb02ected beam is interpreted as a sequence of binary digits. \rAutomotive Microsensors and other microdevices are widely used in modern automotive products. Use of these microsystems is consistent with the increased application of on-board electronics to accomplish control and safety functions for the vehicle. The functions include electronic engine control, cruise control, anti-lock braking systems, air-bag deployment, automatic transmission control, power steering, all-wheel drive, automatic stability control, on-board navigation systems, and remote locking and unlocking,not to mention air conditioning and radio.These control systems and safety features require sensors and actuators, and a growing number of these are microscopic in size.

Indeed, signi\ufb01 cant strides have already been made, and many of the traditional medical and surgical methods have already been transformed by MST.One of the driving forces behind the use of microscopic devices is the principle of minimal-invasive therapy, which involves the use of very small incisions or even available body ori\ufb01ces to access the medical problem of concern. Advantages of this approach over the use of relatively large surgical incisions include less patient discomfort, quicker recovery, fewer and smaller scars, shorter hospital stays, and lower health insurance costs. \rAmong the techniques based on miniaturization of medical instrumentation is the \ufb01eld of endoscopy,3 now routinely used for diagnostic purposes and with growing applications in surgery. It is standard medical practice today to use endoscopic examination accompanied by laparoscopic surgery for hernia repair and removal of organs such as gall bladder and appendix. Growing use of similar procedures is expected in brain surgery, operating through one or more small holes drilled through the skull. \rOther applications of MST in the medical \ufb01eld now include or are expected to include (1) angioplasty, in which damaged blood vessels and arteries are repaired \r2The reason for the rather involved mold-making sequence is because the pitted surfaces of the impressions degrade after multiple uses. A father can be used to make three to six mothers, and each mother can be used to make three to six stampers, before their respective surfaces become degraded. A stamper (mold) can be used to produce only a few thousand disks, so if the production run is for several hundred thousand CDs, more than one stamper must be used during the run to produce all high-quality CDs. 3Endoscopy involves the use of a small instrument (i.e., an endoscope) to visually examine the inside of a hollow body organ such as the rectum or colon. \r\rTABLE \u2022 35.1 Microsensors installed in a modern automobile. \r\rCompiled from [1] and [5]. \rusing surgery, lasers, or miniaturized in\ufb02atable balloons at the end of a catheter that is inserted into the vein; (2) telemicrosurgery, in which a surgical operation is performed remotely using a stereo microscope and microscopic surgical tools; (3) arti\ufb01cial prostheses, such as heart pacemakers and hearing aids; (4) implantable sensor systems to monitor physical variables in the human body such as blood pressure and temperature; (5) drug delivery devices that can be swallowed by a patient and then activated by remote control at the exact location intended for treatment, such as the intestine, and (6) arti\ufb01cial eyes. \rChemical and Environmental A principal role of microsystem technology in chemical and environmental applications is the analysis of substances to measure trace amounts of chemicals or detect harmful contaminants. A variety of chemical microsensors have been developed. They are capable of analyzing very small samples of the substance of interest. Micropumps are sometimes integrated into these systems so that the proper amounts of the substance can be delivered to the sensor component. \rOther Applications There are many other applications of microsystem technology beyond those described above. Some examples are in the following: \r\u27a2 Scanning probe microscope.

Printed circuit board (PCB) and connector technologies are discussed in Chapter 34, but they should also be cited here in the context of MST. Miniaturization trends in electronics have forced PCBs, contacts, and connectors to be fabricated with smaller and more complex physical details, and with mechanical structures that are more consistent with the microdevices discussed in this chapter than with the integrated circuits discussed in Chapter 33. \r\r\r\r\r\rMicrofabrication Processes \rMany of the products in microsystem technology are based on silicon, and most of the processing techniques used in the fabrication of microsystems are borrowed from the microelectronics industry. There are several important reasons why silicon is a desirable material in MST: (1) The microdevices in MST often include electronic circuits, so both the circuit and the microdevice can be fabricated in combination on the same substrate. (2) In addition to its desirable electronic properties, silicon also possesses useful mechanical properties, such as high strength and elasticity, good hardness, and relatively low density.5 (3) The technologies for processing silicon are well- established, owing to their widespread use in microelectronics. (4) Use of single-crystal silicon permits the production of physical features to very close tolerances. \rMicrosystem technology often requires silicon to be fabricated along with other materials to obtain a particular microdevice. For example, microactuators often consist of several components made of different materials.Accordingly,microfabrication techniques consist of more than just silicon processing. The coverage of the micro-fabrication processes is organized into three sections: (1) silicon layering processes, \r(2) the LIGA process, and (3) other processes accomplished on a microscopic scale. \r\r35.2.1 SILICON LAYER PROCESSES \rThe \ufb01rst application of silicon in microsystems technology was in the fabrication of Si piezoresistive sensors for the measurement of stress, strain, and pressure in the early 1960s [5]. Silicon is now widely used in MST to produce sensors, actuators, and other microdevices. The basic processing technologies are those used to produce integrated circuits (Chapter 33). However, it should be noted that certain differences exist between the processing of ICs and the fabrication of the microdevices covered in this chapter: \r1. The aspect ratios in microfabrication are generally much greater than in IC fabrication. Aspect ratio is de\ufb01ned as the height-to-width ratio of the features produced, as illustrated in Figure 35.6. Typical aspect ratios in semiconductor processing are about 1.0 or less, whereas in microfabrication the corresponding ratio might be as high as 400 [5]. \r5Silicon is discussed in Section 7.5.2. \r\r\r\rWidth \r\r\r2. \rThe sizes of the devices made in microfabrication are often much larger than in IC processing, in which the prevailing trend in microelectronics is inexorably toward greater circuit densities and miniaturization. \r\r3. \rThe structures produced in microfabrication often include cantilevers and bridges and other shapes requiring gaps between layers. These kinds of structures are uncommon in IC fabrication. \r\r4. \rThe usual silicon processing techniques are sometimes supplemented to obtain a three-dimensional structure or other physical feature in the microsystem.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 14845, "end_char_idx": 19452, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a45e28a-e787-4575-a552-d0e3418e3864": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a45e28a-e787-4575-a552-d0e3418e3864", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec35.txt", "file_name": "sec35.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 37633, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "921d0833-7325-4ca3-ac69-6aeae29e590e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec35.txt", "file_name": "sec35.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 37633, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "73b07eeddf85b3afbac6cdfae0a5818e1fb23225b800a3963bdbd3a3e1f29e3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a14b236e-2bd0-40da-98b3-4ee0569668ee", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec35.txt", "file_name": "sec35.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 37633, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "3e63c443def78e550d48f2cec4bf292f54a3eddf705e230da2c3d760d95bf426", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "15252ca9-8f9c-43c4-beca-86f8fd044370", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "13967888ed3f66278cbcd5457d43f62325be555a2935fa3612914fc1e7757d5b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Typical aspect ratios in semiconductor processing are about 1.0 or less, whereas in microfabrication the corresponding ratio might be as high as 400 [5]. \r5Silicon is discussed in Section 7.5.2. \r\r\r\rWidth \r\r\r2. \rThe sizes of the devices made in microfabrication are often much larger than in IC processing, in which the prevailing trend in microelectronics is inexorably toward greater circuit densities and miniaturization. \r\r3. \rThe structures produced in microfabrication often include cantilevers and bridges and other shapes requiring gaps between layers.

After all, silicon is the same material whether it is used for integrated circuits or microdevices. The processing steps are listed in Table 35.2, together with brief descriptions and text references where the reader can obtain more detailed descriptions. All of these process steps are discussed in previous chapters. As in IC fabrication, the various processes in Table 35.2 add, alter, or remove layers of material from a substrate according to geometric data contained in lithographic masks. Lithography is the fundamental technology that determines the shape of the microdevice being fabricated. \rRegarding the preceding list of differences between IC fabrication and micro-device fabrication, the issue of aspect ratio should be addressed in more detail. The structures in IC processing are basically planar, whereas three-dimensional structures are more likely to be required in microsystems. The features of microdevices are likely to possess large height-to-width ratios.These 3-D features can be produced in single-crystal silicon by wet etching, provided the crystal structure is oriented to allow the etching process to proceed anisotropically. Chemical wet etching of polycrystalline silicon is isotropic, with the formation of cavities under the edges of the resist, as illustrated in Figure 33.16. However, in single-crystal Si, the etching rate depends on the orientation of the lattice structure. In Figure 35.7, the three crystal faces of silicon\u2019s cubic lattice structure are illustrated. Certain etching solutions, such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), have a very low etching rate in the direction of the (111) crystal face. This permits the formation of \rTABLE \u2022 35.2 Silicon layering processes used in microfabrication. \r\rFIGURE 35.7 Three crystal faces in thesilicon cubic lattice structure: (a) (100)crystal face, (b) (110)crystal face, and (c)\r(111) crystal face. \rdistinct geometric structures with sharp edges in a single-crystal Si substrate whose lattice is oriented to favor etch penetration vertically or at sharp angles into the substrate.

The processing sequence is shown in Figure 35.9. In step (2), epitaxial deposition is used to apply the upper layer of silicon so that it will possess the same single-crystal structure and lattice orientation as the substrate (Section 33.4.2). This is a requirement of bulk micromachining that will be used to provide the deeply etched region in subsequent processing. The use of boron doping to establish the etch resistant layer of silicon is called the p+ etch-stop technique. \rSurface micromachining can be used to construct cantilevers, overhangs, and similar structures on a silicon substrate,as shown in part (5) of Figure 35.10.The cantilevered \r\rSiO2\r\r\rSi \r\r\r\r\rSiO2 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) \rFIGURE 35.9 Formation of a thin membrane in a silicon substrate: (1) silicon substrate is doped with boron; (2) athick layer of silicon is applied on top of the doped layer by epitaxial deposition; (3) both sides are thermally oxidizedto form a SiO2 resist on the surfaces; (4) the resist is patterned by lithography; and (5) anisotropic etching is used toremove the silicon except in the boron-doped layer. \rCantilevers \rSiO2 \r\rSi \r\r(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) \rFIGURE 35.10 Surface micromachining to form cantilevers: (1) on the silicon substrate is formed a silicon dioxidelayer, whose thickness will determine the gap size for the cantilevered member; (2) portions of the SiO2 layer areetched using lithography; (3) a polysilicon layer is applied; (4) portions of the polysilicon layer are etched usinglithography; and (5) the SiO2 layer beneath the cantilevers is selectively etched. \r\r(1) (2) (3) \rFIGURE 35.11 The lift-off technique: (1) resist is applied to substrate and structured bylithography; (2) platinum is deposited onto surfaces; and (3) resist is removed, taking withit the platinum on its surface but leaving the desired platinum microstructure. \rbeams in the \ufb01gure are parallel to but separated by a gap from the silicon surface.

On the other hand, etch selectivity is more of a problem in dry etching; that is, any surfaces exposed to the plasma are attacked. \rA procedure called the lift-off technique is used in microfabrication to pattern metals such as platinum on a substrate.These structures are used in certain chemical sensors, but are dif\ufb01cult to produce by wet etching.

The letters also indicate the LIGA processing sequence. These processing steps have each been described in previous sections of this book: X-ray lithography in Section 33.3.2; electrodeposition and electroforming in Sections 27.3.1 and 27.3.2, respectively; and plastic molding processes in Sections 13.6 and 13.7. The integration of these steps in LIGA technology is examined in this section. \r\rx-ray radiation \r\rMask (a) \rResist (PMMA) \r\rSubstrate (conductive) \r(1) (2) (b) \r(3) (4) \r\rFIGURE 35.12 LIGA processing steps: (1) thick layer of resist applied and X-ray exposure through mask, (2) exposedportions of resist removed, (3) electrodeposition to \ufb01ll openings in resist, (4) resist stripped to provide (a) a mold or (b) a metal part. \rThe LIGA process is illustrated in Figure 35.12. The brief description provided in the \ufb01gure\u2019s caption needs to be expanded: (1) A thick layer of (X-ray) radiation-sensitive resist is applied to a substrate. Layer thickness can range between several microns to centimeters, depending on the size of the part(s) to be produced. The common resist material used in LIGA is polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA, Section 8.2.2 under \u201cAcrylics\u201d). The substrate must be a conductive material for the subsequent electrodeposition processes performed. The resist is exposed through a mask to high-energy X-ray radiation. (2) The irradiated areas of the positive resist are chemically removed from the substrate surface, leaving the unexposed portions standing as a three-dimensional plastic structure. \r(3) The regions where the resist has been removed are \ufb01lled with metal using electrodeposition. Nickel is the common plating metal used in LIGA. (4) The remaining resist structure is stripped (removed), yielding a three-dimensional metal structure. Depending on the geometry created, this metallic structure may be (a) the mold used for producing plastic parts by injection molding, reaction injection molding, or compression molding. In the case of injection molding, in which thermoplastic parts are produced, these parts may be used as \u201clost molds\u201d in investment casting (Section 11.2.4). Alternatively, (b) the metal part may be a pattern for fabricating plastic molds that will be used to produce more metallic parts by electrodeposition. \rAs the description indicates, LIGA can produce parts by several different meth-ods.This is one of the greatest advantages of this microfabrication process:(1) LIGA is a versatile process.

This section discusses several of these additional techniques. \rSoft Lithography This term refers to processes that use an elastomeric \ufb02 at mold (similar to a rubber ink stamp) to create a pattern on a substrate surface.The sequence for creating the mold is illustrated in Figure 35.13.A master pattern is fabricated on a silicon surface using one of the lithography processes such as UV photolithography or electron beam lithography. This master pattern is then used to produce the \ufb02 at mold for the soft lithography process. The common mold material is polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, a silicon rubber, Section 8.4.3). After the PDMS has cured, it is peeled away from the pattern and attached to a substrate for support and handling. \rTwo of the soft lithography processes are micro-imprint lithography and micro-contact printing. In micro-imprint lithography, the mold is pressed into the surface of a soft resist to displace the resist away from certain regions of the substrate for subsequent etching.The process sequence is illustrated in Figure 35.14.The \ufb02at mold consists of raised and depressed regions, and the raised regions correspond to areas on the resist surface that will be displaced to expose the substrate. The resist material is a thermoplastic polymer that has been softened by heating before pressing. The alteration of the resist layer is by mechanical deformation rather than electromagnetic radiation, as in the more traditional lithography methods. The compressed regions of the resist layer are subsequently removed by anisotropic etching (Section 34.4.5). The etching process also reduces the thickness of \r\r\r(1) (2) (3) (4) \rFIGURE 35.14 Steps in micro-imprint lithography:(1) mold positioned above and (2) pressed into resist, (3) mold islifted, and (4) remaining resist is removed from substrate surface in de\ufb01ned regions. \rFIGURE 35.15 \rUltra-high-precisionmilling of grooves inaluminum foil. \rthe remaining resist layer, but enough remains to protect the substrate for subsequent processing. Micro-imprint lithography can be set up for high production rates at modest cost.A mask is not required in the imprint procedure,although the mold requires an analogous preparation. \rThe same type of \ufb02at stamp can be used in a printing mode, in which case the process is called micro-contact printing. In this form of soft lithography, the mold is used to transfer a pattern of a substance to a substrate surface, much like ink can be transferred to a paper surface. This process allows very thin layers to be fabricated onto the substrate. \rNontraditional and Traditional Processes in Microfabrication A number of nontraditional machining processes (Chapter 25), as well as conventional manufacturing processes, are important in microfabrication. Photochemical machining (PCM, Section 25.4.2) is an essential process in IC processing and microfabrication, but it has been referred to in previous descriptions here and in Chapter 33 as wet chemical etching (combined with photolithography).

Photochemical machining (PCM, Section 25.4.2) is an essential process in IC processing and microfabrication, but it has been referred to in previous descriptions here and in Chapter 33 as wet chemical etching (combined with photolithography). PCM is often used with conventional processes of electroplating, electroforming, and/or electroless plating (Section \r27.3) to add layers of metallic materials according to microscopic pattern masks. \rOther nontraditional processes capable of micro-level processing include [5]: (1) electric discharge machining, used to cut holes as small as 0.3 mm in diameter with aspect ratios (depth-to-diameter) as high as 100; (2) electron-beam machining, for cutting holes of diameter smaller than 100 mm in hard-to-machine materials; (3) laser-beam machining, which can produce complex pro\ufb01les and holes as small as 10 mm in diameter with aspect ratios (depth-to-width or depth-to-diameter) approaching 50;(4) ultrasonic machining, capable of drilling holes in hard and brittle materials as small as 50 mm in diameter; and (5) wire electric discharge cutting, or wire-EDM, which can cut very narrow swaths with aspect ratios (depth-to-width) greater than 100. \rTrends in conventional machining have included its capabilities for taking smaller and smaller cut sizes and associated tolerances. Referred to as ultrahigh-precision machining, the enabling technologies have included single-crystal diamond cutting tools and position control systems with resolutions as \ufb01 ne as 0.01 mm [5]. Figure 35.15 depicts one reported application, the milling of grooves in \rv \rDiamond-cutting tool \rToolholder \r\rSpindle Aluminum foil \rVacuum chuck \r\r\raluminum foil using a single-point diamond \ufb02y-cutter. The aluminum foil is 100 mm thick, and the grooves are 85 mm wide and 70 mm deep. Similar ultra-high-precision machining is being applied today to produce products such as computer hard discs, photocopier drums, mold inserts for compact disk reader heads, and high-de\ufb01 nition TV projection lenses. \rRapid Prototyping Technologies Several rapid prototyping (RP) methods (Chapter 32) have been adapted to produce micro-sized parts [7]. RP methods use a layer additive approach to build three-dimensional components, based on a CAD (computer-aided design) geometric model of the component. Each layer is very thin, typically as low as 0.05 mm thick, which approaches the scale of microfabrication technologies. By making the layers even thinner, microcomponents can be fabricated. \rOne approach is called electrochemical fabrication (EFAB), which involves the electrochemical deposition of metallic layers in speci\ufb01c areas that are determined by pattern masks created by \u201cslicing\u201d a CAD model of the object to be made (Section 33.1).The deposited layers are generally 5 to 10 mm thick, with feature sizes as small as 20 mm in width. EFAB is carried out at temperatures below 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0F) and does not require a clean room environment. However, the process is slow, requiring about 40 minutes to apply each layer, or about 35 layers (a height between 180 and 360 mm) per 24-hour period.To overcome this disadvantage,the mask for each layer can contain multiple copies of the part slice pattern, permitting many parts to be produced simultaneously in a batch process. \rAnother RP approach, called microstereolithography, is based on stereolithography (STL, Section 32.2.1), but the scale of the processing steps is reduced in size. Whereas the layer thickness in conventional stereolithography ranges between 75 mm and 500 mm, microstereolithography (MSTL) uses layer thicknesses between 10 and 20 mm typically, with even thinner layers possible. The laser spot size in STL is typically around 250 mm in diameter, whereas MSTL uses a spot size as small as 1 or 2 mm. Another difference in MSTL is that the work material is not limited to a photosensitive polymer.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 31843, "end_char_idx": 36173, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b71678c-7a39-48a3-9d92-71c61b44bfc2": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b71678c-7a39-48a3-9d92-71c61b44bfc2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec35.txt", "file_name": "sec35.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 37633, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "921d0833-7325-4ca3-ac69-6aeae29e590e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec35.txt", "file_name": "sec35.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 37633, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "73b07eeddf85b3afbac6cdfae0a5818e1fb23225b800a3963bdbd3a3e1f29e3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6c48683b-1d68-4058-a0ea-beb90e43395c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec35.txt", "file_name": "sec35.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 37633, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "f535aed9b9d1e0c797c271f943f43b43c28a27f115c88aaf28975579c52695d7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Another RP approach, called microstereolithography, is based on stereolithography (STL, Section 32.2.1), but the scale of the processing steps is reduced in size.

Researchers report success in fabricating 3-D microstructures from ceramic and metallic materials.The difference is that the starting material is a powder rather than a liquid. \rPhotofabrication This term applies to an industrial process in which ultraviolet exposure through a pattern mask causes a signi\ufb01cant modi\ufb01cation in the chemical solubility of an optically clear material. The change is manifested in the form of an increase in solubility to certain etchants. For example, hydro\ufb02uoric acid etches the UV-exposed photosensitive glass between 15 and 30 times faster than the same glass that has not been exposed. Masking is not required during etching, the difference in solubility being the determining factor in which portions of the glass are removed. \rOrigination of photofabrication actually preceded the microprocessing of silicon. Now, with the growing interest in microfabrication technologies, there is a renewed interest in the older technology. Examples of modern materials used in photofabrication include Corning Glass Works\u2019 Fotoform(tm) glasses and Fotoceram(tm) ceramics, and DuPont\u2019s Dycril and Templex photosensitive solid polymers.

Nanotechnology refers to the fabrication and application of entities whose feature sizes range from less than 1 nm to 100 nm (1 nm  103 mm  106 mm  109 m).1 The entities include \ufb01lms, coatings, dots, lines, wires, tubes, structures, and systems. The pre\ufb01x \u201cnano\u201d is used for these items; thus, new words such as nanotube, nanostructure, nanoscale, and nanoscience have entered the vocabulary. Nanoscience is the \ufb01eld of scienti\ufb01c study that is concerned with objects in the same size range. Nano scale refers to dimensions within this range and slightly below, which overlaps on the lower end with the sizes of atoms and molecules. For example, the smallest atom is hydrogen with a diameter close to 0.1 nm, whereas the largest of the naturally occurring atoms is uranium with a diameter of about 0.4 nm [4]. Molecules tend to be larger because they consist of multiple atoms. Molecules made up of about 30 atoms are roughly 1 nm in size,depending on the elements involved.Thus,nanoscience involves the behavior of individual molecules and the principles that explain this behavior, and nanotechnology involves the application of these principles to create useful products. \rIn the previous chapter, an overview of the products and devices in microsystem technology was provided. This chapter gives the same type of overview for nanotechnology. What are the currently available and potential future products and materials? Nanotechnology invol ves not just a reduction in scale by three orders of magnitude.The science is different when the sizes of the entities approach the molecular and atomic levels. Some of these differences are discussed in Section 36.2. Finally, in Section 36.3, the two major categories of fabrication processes used in nanotechnology are described. \r1The dividing line between nanotechnology and microsystem technology (Chapter 35) is considered to be 100 nm ! 0.1 mm [7]. This is illustrated in Figure 35.1. \r\r\r\r\rNanotechnology Products and Applications \rMost products in nanotechnology are not just smaller versions of microsystem technology (MST) products; they also include new materials, coatings, and unique entities that are not included within the scope of MST. Nanoscale products and processes that have been around for a while include the following: \r\u27a2 \rThe colorful stained-glass windows of churches built during the Middle Ages were based on gold particles of nanometer scale imbedded in the glass. Depending on their size, the particles can take on a variety of different colors. \r\r\u27a2 \rChemical photography dates back more than 150 years and depends on the formation of silver halide nanoparticles to create the image in the photograph. \r\r\u27a2 \rNanoscale particles of carbon are used as reinforcing \ufb01llers in automobile tires. \r\r\u27a2 \rCatalytic converters in the exhaust systems of modern automobiles use nanoscale coatings of platinum and palladium on a ceramic honeycomb structure. The metal coatings act as catalysts to convert harmful emission gases into harmless gases. \r\r\rIt should also be mentioned that the fabrication technology for integrated circuits now includes feature sizes that are in the nanotech range. Of course, integrated circuits have been produced since the 1960s, but only in recent years have nanoscale features been achieved. \rOther more recent products and applications of nanotechnology include cosmetics, sun lotions, car polishes and waxes, coatings for eyeglass lenses, and scratch-resistant paints. All of these categories contain nanoscale particles (nanoparticles), which quali\ufb01es them as products of nanotechnology.

Of course, integrated circuits have been produced since the 1960s, but only in recent years have nanoscale features been achieved. \rOther more recent products and applications of nanotechnology include cosmetics, sun lotions, car polishes and waxes, coatings for eyeglass lenses, and scratch-resistant paints.

It is the presence of the nanoparticles functioning in aggregate that distinguishes incremental nanotechnology. All of the examples listed above are in this category, except chemical photography and integrated circuits. \rEvolutionary nanotechnology involves the use of nanoparticles in great numbers that each accomplishes some unique and worthwhile purpose. The presence of nanoparticles functioning individually is what distinguished this category of nanotechnology. It could be argued that chemical photography is an example of evolutionary nanotechnology because of the individual responses of different regions of the \ufb01lm to the projected light from the image.

As a storage device, each particle stores one bit of data that is individually addressable. As an imaging device, each particle emits its own color and brightness that are individually controllable; taken together, an image is formed. \rRadical nanotechnology is concerned with the construction of microscopic machines that consist of nanoscale features and mechanisms. This nanotechnology category sub divides into two branches: molecular manufacturing and nanorobots. Molecular manufacturing envisions the possibility of constructing some macroscopic entity by assembling the atoms that comprise it. One way of doing this is by moving atoms or molecules one by one to controlled locations to accomplish the assembly.This approachinvolvesthe use of scanningprobe techniques,discussed in Section 36.3.2. It is of scienti\ufb01c interest but not a practical production process. An alternative and more realistic approach, also discussed in Section 36.3.2, involves self-assembly, in which the atoms and/or molecules are guided by physical or chemical laws to build the macroscopic entity. \rThe other branch of radical nanotechnology is more futuristic. It conceives of nanoscale robots (i.e., nanorobots or nanobots) that are equipped with some form of intelligence and a gripper with which they could assemble atoms and molecules. Such devices could be used to perform molecular manufacturing, if there were a suf\ufb01 cient number of nanorobots on the job.The scary aspect of the nanobot concept is that these molecular machines could also self-replicate, perhaps increasing their numbers at an exponential rate to wreak havoc on earth. \rThe notion of nanoscale machines, which is the basis of radical nanotechnology, is reminiscent of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), an important product category in microsystem technology. MEMS have found many applications in the computer, medical, and automotive industries (Section 35.1.2). With the advent of nanotechnology, there is growing interest in extending the development of these kinds of devices into the nanoscale range.

The term for this is nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), which are the sub-micron sized counterparts of MEMS devices, only their smaller sizes would result in even greater potential advantages. An important NEMS structural product currently produced is the probe used in atomic force microscopes (Section 36.2.2). The sharp point on the probe is of nanoscale size. Nanosensors are another developing application. Nanosensors would be more accurate, faster responding, and operate with lower power requirements than larger sensors. Current NEMS sensor applications include accelerometers and chemical sensors. It has been suggested that multiple nanosensors could be distributed throughout the subject area to collect data, thus providing the bene\ufb01t of multiple readings of the variable of interest, rather than using a single larger sensor at one location. \rFormidable technical problems arise in attempting to build nanorobots and other nanomachines, de\ufb01ned as nanosystems that consist of movable parts and at least two different materials [8]. The problems result from the fact that the part surfaces cannot be made smooth and part edges and corners cannot be made sharp at the atomic and molecular sizes. Other surface characteristics also come into play, as discussed in Section 36.2.1. \r\r36.1.2 CARBON NANOSTRUCTURES \rTwo structures of signi\ufb01cant scienti\ufb01c and commercial interest in nanotechnology are carbon bucky balls and nanotubes. They are basically graphite layers that have been formed into spheres and tubes, respectively. \rFullerenes (Bucky Balls) The name \u201cbucky ball\u201d refers to the molecule C60, which contains exactly 60 carbon atoms and is shaped like a soccer ball, as in Figure 36.1. \rFIGURE 36.1 Fullerine structure of the C60 molecule. (Reprinted by permission from [18].) \rThe original name of the molecule was buckministerfullerene, after the architect/ inventor R. Buckminister Fuller, who designed the geodesic dome that resembles the C60 structure. Today, C60 is simply called a fullerene, which refers to any closed hollow carbon molecules that consist of 12 pentagonal and various numbers of hexa gonal faces. In the case of C60, the 60 atoms are arranged symmetrically into 12 penta gonal faces and 20 hexagonal faces to form a ball. These molecular balls can be bonded together by van der Waals forces (Section 2.2) to form crystals whose lattice structure is face-centered cubic (Figure 2.8(b), Section 2.3.1). The separation between any molecule and its closest neighbor in the C60 lattice structure is 1 nm. The bonded assembly of multiple fullerenes is called a fullerite. \rFullerenes and fullerites are of interest for a number of reasons. One is their electrical properties and the capability to alter these properties. A C60 crystal has the properties of an insulator. However, when doped with an alkaline metal such as potassium (forming K3C60), it is transformed into an electrical conductor. Moreover, it exhibits properties of a superconductor at temperatures of around 18K. Another potential application area for the C60 fullerenes is in the medical \ufb01 eld. The C60 molecule has many possible attachment points for focused drug treatments. Other possible medical applications for bucky balls include antioxidants, burn creams, and diagnostic imaging. \rCarbon Nanotubes Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are another molecular structure consisting of carbon atoms bonded together in the shape of a long tube.

The atoms can be arranged into a number of alternative con\ufb01 gurations, three of which are illustrated in Figure 36.2. The nanotubes shown in the \ufb01 gure are all \r(a) \r(b) \rFIGURE 36.2 Several possible structures of carbon nanotubes: (a) armchair,\r(b) zigzag, and (c) chiral. (Reprinted by permission \r(c)\rfrom [18].) \rsingle-walled nanotubes (SWNT), but multi-walled structures (MWNT) can also be fabricated, which are tubes within a tube. A SWNT has a typical diameter of a few nanometers (down to ~ 1 nm) and a length of ~ 100 nm, and it is closed at both ends. Much larger SWNTs are possible, and the longest one on record is 18 mm (~ 3/4 in) long and 20 nm in diameter [4]. That is a length\u2013to\u2013diameter ratio of 900,000:1. \rThe electrical properties of nanotubes are unusual. Depending on the structure and diameter, nanotubes can have metallic (conducting) or semiconducting proper ties. Conductivity of metallic nanotubes can be superior to that of copper by six orders of magnitude [8]. The explanation for this is that nanotubes contain few of the defects existing in metals that tend to scatter electrons, thus increasing electrical resistance. Because nanotubes have such low resistance, high currents do not increase their temperature the way metals heat up under the same electrical loads. Thermal conductivity of metallic nanotubes is also very high. These electrical and thermal properties are of signi\ufb01 cant interest to manufacturers of computers and inte grated circuits because they may allow higher clock speeds of processors without the heat buildup problems currently encountered as the density of components on a silicon chip increases. Clock speeds 104 times faster than current-day processors may be possible [18], along with much higher densities. \rAnother electrical property of carbon nanotubes is \ufb01eld emission, in which electrons are emitted from the ends of the tubes at very high rates when an electrical \ufb01 eld is applied parallel to the axis of a nanotube. The possible commercial applications of \ufb01 eld emission properties of nanotubes include \ufb02 at panel displays for televisions and computer monitors. \rMechanical properties are another reason for the interest in single-walled nano tubes. Compared with steel, density is only 1/6, modulus of elasticity is \ufb01ve times higher, and tensile strength is ~ 100 times greater [8]. Yet, when SWNTs are bent, they exhibit great resilience to return to their previous shape without damage. These mechanical properties present opportunities for using them in applications ranging from reinforcing materials in polymer matrix composites (Section 9.4) to \ufb01ber cloths in bulletproof vests. Ironically, multiwalled nanotubes are not as strong. \r\r36.1.3 THE NATIONAL NANOTECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE \rIn the year 2000, a national initiative on nanotechnology was enacted by the U.S. Congress at a funding level of $400 million starting in 2001.

Table 36.2 brie\ufb02y describes the nine areas of nanotechnology development to provide an overview of the future opportunities envi sioned for this technology. \rTABLE \u2022 36.2 Nine areas of nanotechnology development identi\ufb01ed in the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). \r\rCompiled from [14]. \r\r\r\rIntroduction to Nanoscience \rThe \ufb01elds of nanoscience and nanotechnology are interdisciplinary.They rely on the synergistic contributions of chemistry, physics, various engineering disciplines, and computer science.The \ufb01elds of biology and medical science are also involved.Biology operates in the nanoscale range. Proteins, basic substances in living organisms, are large molecules ranging in size between about 4 nm and 50 nm. Proteins are made up of amino acids (organic acids containing the amino group NH2), whose molecular size is about 0.5 nm. Each protein molecule consists of combinations of various amino acid molecules3 connected together to form a long chain (call it a nanowire). This long macromolecule twists and turns to compact itself into a mass with a cross section in the 4- to 50-nm range. Other biological entities of nanoscale size include chlorophyll molecules in plants (about 1 nm), hemoglobin in blood (7 nm), and \ufb02u viruses (60 nm). Biological cells are orders of magnitude larger. For example, a red blood cell is disk-shaped with diameter of about 8000 nm (8 mm) and thickness of about 1500 nm (1.5 mm). The diameter of the human hair shown in Figure 35.3 is approximately 100,000 nm (0.1 mm). \rThe focus in this chapter is on nanoscale entities that are nonbiological. As in biology, nanotechnology deals with objects that are not much bigger than the atoms and molecules that comprise them. Section 36.2.1 discusses these \u201csize effects\u201d and how material properties are affected when the dimensions of an entity are measured in nanometers. The inability to \u201csee\u201d nanoscale objects has inhibited developments in nanotechnology until recently. The advent of scanning probe microscopes in the 1980s has allowed objects at the molecular level to be visualized and measured. These types of microscopes are described in Section 36.2.2. \r36.2.1 SIZE MATTERS \rOne of the physical effects that occurs with very small objects is that their surface properties become much more important relative to their bulk properties. Consider the surface-to-volume ratio of a given amount of material as its dimensions are changed.

Suppose the molecules of this material are cube-shaped, and from the earlier discussion, each molecule measures 1 nm on a side (admittedly, the molecular cube shape is a stretch,but the 1-nm size is plausible).This means that the 1-mm cube contains 109 molecules, of which 6(106) are on the surface of the cube. This leaves 109 \" 6(106) ! 994(106) molecules that are internal (beneath the surface). The ratio of internal to surface molecules is 994\u2013to\u20136 or 165.667\u2013to\u20131. By comparison, the same ratio for a cube with 1 m on a side is about 1027\u2013to\u20131.

Nanotechnology will enable the development of entirely new classes of materials. \r\r\rAnother difference that arises between nanoscale objects and their macroscopic counterparts is that material behavior tends to be in\ufb02uenced by quantum mechanics rather than bulk properties.Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that is concerned with the notion that all forms of energy (e.g., electricity, light) occur in discrete units when observed on a small enough scale.The discrete units are called quanta (plural of quantum), which cannot be further subdivided. For example, electricity is conducted in units of electrons.An electrical charge of less than one electron is not possible.In light energy, the quanta are photons. In magnetic energy, they are called magnons. For every type of energy there are comparable units. All physical phenomena exhibit quantum behavior at the submicroscopic level. On a macroscopic level, the energy appears to be continuous because it is being released in very large quantities of quanta. \rThe movement of electrons in microelectronics is of particular interest because of the signi\ufb01 cant reductions in size that continue to be achieved in the fabrication of integrated circuits. The feature sizes of the devices in integrated circuits produced in 2009 were on the order of 50 nm. They are projected to decrease in size to about 20 nm by around 2015. At a feature size of around 10 nm, the effects of quantum mechanics become signi\ufb01 cant, changing the way a device operates. As feature size continues to be reduced toward just a few nanometers, the proportion of surface atoms in the device increases relative to those beneath the surface, which means that the electrical characteristics are no longer determined exclusively by the bulk properties of the material. As device size continues to decrease and density of components on a chip continues to increase, the electronics industry is approaching the limits of technological feasibility of the current fabrication processes described in Chapter 33. \r\r36.2.2 SCANNING PROBE MICROSCOPES \rConventional optical microscopes use visible light focused through optical lenses to provide enlarged images of very small objects. However, the wavelength of visible light is 400\u2013700 nm, which is greater than the dimensions of nanosized objects. Thus, these objects cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopes. The most powerful optical microscopes provide magni\ufb01cations of about 1000 times, allowing resolutions of about 0.0002 mm (200 nm). Electron microscopes, which allow specimens to be visualized utilizing a beam of electrons instead of light, were developed in the 1930s.Theelectronbeamcanbeconsidered as a form of wavemotion,but one that has a much shorter effective wavelength. (Today\u2019s electron microscopes permit magni\ufb01 cations of about 1,000,000 times and resolutions of about one nanometer). To obtain an image of a surface, the electron beam is scanned across the surface of an object in a raster pattern, similar to the way that a cathode ray scans the surface of a (tube-type or projection-type) television screen. \rFor making observations on the nanoscale level, an improvement over the electron microscope is the family of scanning probe instruments that date from the 1980s. They possess magni\ufb01cation capabilities approximately 10 times greater than an electron microscope. In a scanning probe microscope (SPM), the probe consists of a needle with a very sharp tip.The point size approaches the size of a single atom. In operation, the probe is moved along the surface of the specimen at a distance of only one nanometer or so, and any of several properties of the surface are measured, depending on the type of scanning probe device.

The two scanning probe microscopes of greatest interest in nanotechnology are the scanning tunneling microscope and the atomic force microscope. \rThe scanning tunneling microscope (STM) was the \ufb01rst scanning probe instrument to be developed. It is called a tunneling microscope because its operation is based on the quantum mechanics phenomenon known as tunneling, in which individual electrons in a solid material can jump beyond the surface of the solid into space.The probability of electrons being in this space beyond the surface decreases exponentially in proportion to the distance from the surface. This sensitivity to distance is exploited in the STM by positioning the probe tip very close to the surface (i.e., 1 nm) and applying a small voltage between the two. This causes electrons of surface atoms to be attracted to the small positive charge of the tip, and they tunnel across the gap to the probe. As the probe is moved along the surface, varia tions in the resulting current occur due to the positions of individual atoms on the surface. Alternatively, if the elevation of the tip above the surface is allowed to \ufb02 oat by maintaining a constant current, then the vertical de\ufb02 ection of the tip can be measured as it traverses the surface. These variations in current or de\ufb02 ection can be used to create images or topographical maps of the surface on an atomic or molecular scale. \rA limitation of the scanning tunneling microscope is that it can only be used on surfaces of conducting materials. By comparison, the atomic force microscope (AFM) can be used on any material; it uses a probe attached to a delicate cantilever that de\ufb02ects due to the force exerted by the surface on the probe as it traverses the specimen surface. The AFM responds to various types of forces, depending on the application.The forces include mechanical due to physical contact of the probe with the specimen surface, and noncontact, such as van der Waals forces (Section 2.2), capillary forces, magnetic forces,4 and others. The vertical de\ufb02ection of the probe is measured optically, based on the interference pattern of a light beam or the re\ufb02ection of a laser beam from the cantilever. Figure 36.3 shows an image generated by an AFM. \r4 The term magneticforce microscope (MFM) is used when the forces are magnetic. The principle of operation is similar to that of the reading head on a hard disk drive. \rFIGURE 36.3 An atomic force microscope image ofsilicon dioxide letters on a silicon substrate.

Section 36.3.2 discusses the bottom-up approaches, which may be of greater interest because of their special relevance to nanotechnology. \r36.3.1 TOP-DOWN PROCESSING APPROACHES \rThe top-down approaches for fabricating nanoscale objects involve the processing of bulk materials (e.g., silicon wafers) and thin \ufb01 lms using lithographic techniques like those used in the processing of integrated circuits and microsystems. \rThe top-down approaches also include other precision machining techniques (Section 35.2.3) that have been adapted for making nanostructures. The term nanomachining is used for these processes that involve material removal when applied in the sub-micron scale. Nanostructures have been machined out of mate rials such as silicon, silicon carbide, diamond, and silicon nitride [24]. Nanomachining must often be coupled with thin-\ufb01lm deposition processes such as physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition (Section 27.5) to achieve the desired structure and combination of materials. \rAs the feature sizes of the components in an integrated circuit (IC) become smaller and smaller, fabrication techniques based on optical lithography become limited because of the wavelengths of visible light. Ultraviolet light is currently used to fabricate ICs because its shorter wavelengths permit smaller features to be fabricated, thus allowing higher densities of components in the IC. The current technology being re\ufb01ned for IC fabrication is called extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography (Section 33.3.2). It uses UV light with a wavelength as short as 13 nm, which is certainly within the nanotechnology range. However, certain technical problems must be addressed when EUV lithography is used at these very short UV wavelengths. The problems include (1) new photoresists that are sensitive to this wavelength must be used, (2) focusing systems must be based on all re\ufb02ective optics, and (3) plasma sources based on laser irradiation of the element xenon [15] must be used. \rOther lithography techniques are available for use in fabricating nanoscale structures. These include electron-beam lithography, X-ray lithography, and micro- or nano-imprint lithography. Electron-beam and X-ray lithography are discussed in the context of integrated circuit processing (Section 33.3.2). Electron-beam litho graphy (EBL) operates by directing a highly focused beam of electrons along the desired pattern across the surface of a material, thus exposing the surface areas using a sequential process without the need for a mask. Although EBL is capable of resolutions on the order of 10 nm, its sequential operation makes it relatively slow compared to masking techniques and thus unsuited to mass production. X-ray lithography can produce patterns with resolutions around 20 nm, and it uses masking techniques, which makes high production possible. However, X-rays are dif\ufb01 cult to focus and require contact or proximity printing (Section 33.3.1). In addition, the equipment is expensive for production applications, and X-rays are hazardous to humans. \rTwo of the processes known as soft lithography are described in Section 35.2.3.

Nano-imprint lithography can produce pattern resolutions of approximately 5 nm [24]. One of the original applications of nano-contact printing was to transfer a thin \ufb01lm of thiols (a family of organic compounds derived from hydrogen sul\ufb01 de) onto a gold surface. The uniqueness of the application was that the \ufb01lm was only one molecule thick (called a monolayer, Section 36.3.2), which certainly quali\ufb01es as nanoscale. \r\r36.3.2 BOTTOM-UP PROCESSING APPROACHES \rIn the bottom-up approaches, the starting materials are atoms, molecules, and ions. The processes bring these basic building blocks together, in some cases one at a time, to fabricate the desired nanoscale entity. The coverage consists of four approaches that are of considerable interest in nanotechnology: (1) production of fullerenes, \r(2) production of carbon nanotubes, (3) nanofabrication by scanning probe techniques, and (4) self-assembly. \rProduction of Fullerenes The starting material for the manufacture of fullerenes is carbon black produced from an electric arc between two graphite electrodes.The resulting product contains 20% or less carbon fullerenes mixed in with other forms of carbon and hydrocarbons. Around 75% of the fullerene content is C60 with the rest being fullerenes of higher molecular weight. The problem is to separate the C60 and other fullerenes from the mixture. It turns out that fullerenes are soluble in certain organic solvents whereas the other carbon products are not.Thus,the entire output is subjected to the solvent process and the insoluble carbon solids are \ufb01 ltered out, leaving the fullerenes in solution. These are classi\ufb01 ed into different sizes using a chromatographic technique that distinguishes among molecules by their molecular weight. \rProduction of Carbon Nanotubes The remarkable properties and potential applications of carbon nanotubes are discussed in Section 36.1.2. Carbon nanotubes can be produced by several techniques. In the following paragraphs three are discussed: \r(1) laser evaporation, (2) carbon arc techniques, and (3) chemical vapor deposition. \rIn the laser evaporation method, the starting raw material is a graphite workpiece containing small amounts of cobalt and nickel. These metal traces perform the role of catalyst, acting as nucleation sites for the subsequent formation of the nanotubes. The graphite is placed in a quartz tube \ufb01lled with argon gas and heated to 1200C (2200F).A pulsed laser beam is focused on the workpiece,causing the carbon atoms to evaporate from the bulk graphite. The argon moves the carbon atoms out of the high-temperature region of the tube and into an area in which a water-cooled copper apparatus is located. The carbon atoms condense on the cold copper, and as they do, they form nanotubes with diameters of 10 to 20 nm and lengths of about 100 mm. \rThe carbon arc technique uses two carbon electrodes that are 5 to 20 mm in diameter and separated by 1 mm. The electrodes are located in a partially evacuated container (about 2/3 of 1 atmospheric pressure) with helium \ufb02 owing init.Tostart the process, a voltage of about 25 V is applied across the two electrodes, causing carbon atoms to be ejected from the positive electrode and carried to the negative electrode where they form nanotubes. The structure of the nanotubes depends on whether a catalyst is used. If no catalyst is used, then multiwalled nanotubes are produced.

In one variation of CVD, the starting work material is a hydrocarbon gas such as methane (CH4). The gas is heated to 1100C (2000F), causing it to decompose and release carbon atoms.

The substrate may contain iron or other metals that act as catalysts for the process. The metal catalyst acts as a nucleation site for creation of the nanotube, and it also controls the orientation of the structure. An alternative CVD process called HiPCO5 starts with carbon monoxide (CO) and uses carbon pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO)5) as the catalyst to produce high-purity, single-walled nanotubes at 900 to 1100C (1700\u20132000F) and 30 to 50 atm [8]. Production of nanotubes by CVD has the advantage that it can be operated continuously, which makes it economically attractive for mass production. \rNanofabrication by Scanning Probe Techniques Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques are described in Section 36.2.2 in the context of measuring and observing nanometer-scale features and objects. In addition to viewing a surface, the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) can also be used to manipulate individual atoms, molecules, or clusters of atoms or molecules that adhere to a substrate surface by the forces of adsorption (weak chemical bonds). Clusters of atoms or molecules are called nanoclusters, and their size is just a few nanometers. Figure 36.4(a) illustrates the variation in either current or de\ufb02 ection of the STM probe tip as it is moved across a surface upon which is located an adsorbed atom. As the tip moves over the surface immediately above the adsorbed atom, there is an increase in the signal. Although the bonding force that attracts the atom to the surface is weak, it is signi\ufb01 cantly greater than the force of attraction created by the tip, simply because the distance is greater. However, if the probe tip is moved close enough to the adsorbed atom so that its force of attraction is greater than the adsorption force, the atom will be dragged along the surface, as suggested in Figure 36.4(b). In this way, individual atoms or molecules \r5HiPCO stands for high-pressure carbon monoxide decomposition process. \rcan be manipulated to create various nanoscale structures.A notable STM example accomplished at the IBM Research Labs was the fabrication of the company logo out of xenon atoms adsorbed onto a nickel surface in an area 5 nm by 16 nm.

In lateral manipulation, atoms or molecules are transferred horizontally along the surface by the attractive or repulsive forces exerted by the STM tip, as in Figure 36.4(b). In vertical manipulation, the atoms or molecules are lifted from the surface and deposited at a different location to form a structure.Although this kind of STM manipulation of atoms and molecules is of scienti\ufb01c interest, there are technological limitations that inhibit its commercial application, at least in high production of nanotech products. One of the limitations is that it must be carried out in a very high vacuum environment to prevent stray atoms or molecules from interfering with the process. Another limitation is that the surface of the substrate must be cooled to temperatures approaching absolute zero (273C or 460F) to reduce thermal diffusion that would gradually distort the atomic structure being formed. These limitations make it a very slow and expensive process. \rThe atomic force microscope is also used for similar nanoscale manipulations. In comparing the AFM and STM applications, the AFM is more versatile because it is not restricted to conductive surfaces as is the STM and it can be used under normal room conditions. On the other hand, the AFM has a lower resolution than the STM. Consequently, the STM can be used to manipulate single atoms, while the AFM is better suited to the manipulation of larger molecules and nanoclusters [24]. \rAnother scanning probe technique, one that shows promise for practical applications, is called dip-pen nanolithography. In dip-pen nanolithography (DPN), the tip of an atomic force microscope is used to transfer molecules to a substrate surface by means of a solvent meniscus, as shown in Figure 36.5. The process is somewhat analogous to using an old-fashioned quill pen to transfer ink to a paper surface via capillary forces. In DPN, the AFM tip serves as the nib of the pen, and the substrate becomes the surface onto which the dissolved molecules (i.e., the ink) are deposited. The deposited molecules must have a chemical af\ufb01 nity for the substrate material, just as wet ink adheres to paper. DPN can be used to \u201cwrite\u201d patterns of molecules onto a surface, in which the patterns are of submicron dimension. Line widths as small as 10 to 15 nm are reported [27]. In addition, DPN can be used to deposit different types of molecules at different locations on the substrate surface. \rWriting direction \r\rFIGURE 36.5 Dip-pen nanolithography, in which the tip of an atomic force microscopeis used to deposit moleculesthrough the water meniscusthat forms naturally betweenthe tip and the substrate. \rMolecular transport AFM tip \rLiquid (solvent) meniscus \r\rSubstrate \rSelf-Assembly Self-assembly is a fundamental process in nature.

The term biomimetics describes this process of building arti\ufb01cial, nonbiological entities by imitating nature\u2019s methods. Desirable attributes of atomic or molecular self-assembly processes in nanotechnology include the following: (1) they can be carried out rapidly; (2) they occur automatically and do not require any central control; (3) they exhibit massive replication; and (4) they can be performed under mild environmental conditions (at or near atmospheric pressure and room temperature). Self-assembly is likely to be the most important of the nanofabrication processes because of its low cost, its capacity for producing structures over a range of sizes (from nanoscale to macroscale), and its general applicability to a wide variety of products [19]. \rAn underlying principle behind self-assembly is the principle of minimum energy. Physical entities such as atoms and molecules seek out a state that minimizes the total energy of the system of which they are components. This principle has the following implications for self-assembly: \r1. \rThere must be some mechanism for the movement of the entities (e.g., atoms, molecules, ions) in the system, thus causing the entities to come into close proximity with one another. Possible mechanisms for this movement include diffusion, convection in a \ufb02uid, and electric \ufb01 elds. \r\r2. \rThere must be some form of molecular recognition among the entities. Molecular recognition refers to the tendency of one molecule (or atom or ion) to be attracted to and bind with another molecule (or atom or ion), for example, the way sodium and chlorine are attracted to each other to form table salt. \r\r3. \rThe molecular recognition among the entities causes them to join in such a way that the resulting physical arrangement of the entities achieves a state of minimum energy.The joining process involves chemical bonding,usually the weaker secondary types (e.g., van der Waals bonds). \r\r\rAt least two instances of molecular-level self-assembly have previously been encountered in this book: (1) crystal formation and (2) polymerization. Crystal formation in metals, ceramics, and certain polymers is a form of self-assembly. Growing silicon boules in the Czochralski process (Section 33.2.2) for fabrication of integrated circuits is a good illustration. Using a starting seed crystal, very pure molten silicon is formed into a large cylindrical solid whose repeating lattice structure matches that of the seed throughout its volume. The lattice spacing in the crystal structure is of nanometer proportions, but the replication exhibits long-range order. \rIt can be argued that polymers are products of nanometer-scale self-assembly.The process of polymerization (Section 8.1.1) involves the joining of individual monomers (individual molecules such as ethylene C2H4) to form very large molecules (macromolecules such as polyethylene), often in the form of a long chain with thousands of repeating units. Copolymers (Section 8.1.2) represent a more complex self-assembly process, in which two different types of starting monomers are joined in a regular repeating structure.

Of greater relevance in this chapter are self-assembly fabrication techniques that have been developed under the nanotechnology banner. These self-assembly processes, most of which are still in the research stage, include the following categories: (1) fabrication of nanoscale objects, including molecules, macromolecules, clusters of molecules, nanotubes, and crystals; and (2) formation of two-dimensional arrays such as self-assembled monolayers (surface \ufb01lms that are one molecule thick) and three-dimensional networks of molecules. \rSome of the processes in category 1 have already been discussed (e.g., fullerenes and nanotubes). The self-assembly of surface \ufb01 lms is an important example of category 2. Surface \ufb01lms are two-dimensional coatings formed on a solid (threedimensional) substrate. Most surface \ufb01 lms are inherently thin, yet the thickness is typically measured in micrometers or even millimeters (or fractions thereof), well above the nanometer scale. Of interest here are surface \ufb01 lms whose thicknesses are measured in nanometers. Of particular interest in nanotechnology are surface \ufb01 lms that self-assemble, are only one molecule thick, and where the molecules are organized in some orderly fashion. These types of \ufb01 lms are called self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). Multilayered structures are also possible that possess order and are two or more molecules thick. \rThe substrate materials for self-assembled monolayers and multilayers include a variety of metallic and other inorganic materials. The list includes gold, silver, copper, silicon, and silicon dioxide. Noble metals have the advantage of not forming an oxide surface \ufb01 lm that would interfere with the reactions that generate the desired layer of interest. Layering materials include thiols, sul\ufb01des, and disul\ufb01 des. The layering material must be capable of being adsorbed onto the surface material. The typical process sequence in the formation of the monolayer of a thiol on gold is illustrated in Figure 36.6.6 Layering molecules move freely above the substrate surface and are adsorbed onto the surface. Contact occurs between adsorbed molecules on the surface, and they form stable islands. The islands become larger and gradually join together through the addition of more molecules laterally on the surface, until the substrate is completely covered. Bonding to the gold surface is provided by the sulfur atom in the thiol, sul\ufb01 de, or disul\ufb01 de layer. In some applications, self-assembled monolayers can be formed into desired patterns or regions on the substrate surface using techniques such as nano-contact printing and dip-pen nanolithography. \r6This combination of thiol on a gold surface was mentioned in Section 36.3.1 in the context of nanocontact printing.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 46044, "end_char_idx": 49345, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37932564-11aa-4a5a-8375-0e33912805ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "37932564-11aa-4a5a-8375-0e33912805ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec37.txt", "file_name": "sec37.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 73282, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32850748-0777-4972-8db0-8666a0ac0b23", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec37.txt", "file_name": "sec37.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 73282, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "011c06de5b1a32cea580454e80cdef388a20f5bb68d079d282a9d4c214df331b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1ece1915-e2f7-4b43-a762-91fc35ec9492", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0141cff94fd6389eb25f6ff618ee4156bccc1aa9b7f851ed85e6620e40923eb5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Part X Manufacturing Systems \r\r37 Automation Technologies forManufacturing systems \rChapter Contents \r37.1 Automation Fundamentals \r37.1.1 Three Components of an Automated System \r37.1.2 Types of Automation \r\r\r37.2 Hardware for Automation \r37.2.1 Sensors \r37.2.2 Actuators \r37.2.3 Interface Devices \r37.2.4 Process Controllers \r\r\r37.3 Computer Numerical Control \r37.3.1 The Technology of Numerical Control \r37.3.2 Analysis of NC Positioning Systems \r37.3.3 NC Part Programming \r37.3.4 Applications of Numerical Control \r\r\r37.4 Industrial Robotics \r37.4.1 Robot Anatomy \r37.4.2 Control Systems and Robot Programming \r37.4.3 Applications of Industrial Robots \rThis part of the book describes the manufacturing systems that are commonly used to implement the production and assembly processes discussed in preceding chapters. A manufacturing system can be de\ufb01ned as a collection of integrated equipment and human resources that performs one or more processing and/or assembly operations on a starting work material, part, or set of parts. The integrated equipment consists of production machines, material handling and positioning devices, and computer systems. Human resources are required either full-time or part-time to keep the equipment operating. The position of the manufacturing systems in the larger production system is shown in Figure 37.1. As the diagram indicates, the manufacturing systems are located in the factory. They accomplish the value-added work on the part or product. \rManufacturing systems include both automated and manually operated systems.The distinction between the two categories is not always clear, because many manufacturing systems consist of both automated and manual work elements (e.g., a machine tool that operates on a semiautomatic processing cycle but must be loaded and unloaded each cycle by a human worker). The coverage includes both categories and is organized into two chapters: Chapter 37 on automation technologies and Chapter 38 on integrated manufacturing systems. Chapter 37 provides an introductory treatment of automation technology and the components that make up an automated system. Also, two important automation technologies used in manufacturing are described: numerical control and industrial robotics. Chapter 38 examines how these automation technologies are integrated into more sophisticated manufacturing systems. Topics include production lines, cellular manufacturing, \ufb02exible manufacturing systems, and computer integrated manufacturing. A more detailed discussion of the topics in these two chapters can be found in [5]. \r\r\r\r\r\r\rAutomation Fundamentals \rAutomation can be de\ufb01ned as the technology by which a process or procedure is performed without human assistance. Humans may be present as observers or even participants, but the process itself operates under its own self-direction. Automation is implemented by means of a control system that executes a program of instructions. To automate a process, power is required to operate the control system and to drive the process itself. \r\r37.1.1 THREE COMPONENTS OF AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM \rFIGURE 37.2 \rElements of an automated system:\r(1)\r power, (2) program of instructions, and \r\r(3)\r control system. \r\r\rAs indicated above, an automated system consists of three basic components: (1) power, (2) a program of instructions, and (3) a control system to carry out the instructions. The relationship among these components is shown in Figure 37.2. \rThe form of power used in most automated systems is electrical. The advantages of electrical power include that it (1) is widely available, (2) can be readily converted \r\rProcess output \r\r\rto other forms of power such as mechanical, thermal, or hydraulic, (3) can be used at very low power levels for functions such as signal processing, communication, data storage, and data processing, and (4) can be stored in long-life batteries [5]. \rIn a manufacturing process, power is required to accomplish the activities associated with the particular process. Examples of these activities include (1) melting a metal in a casting operation, (2) driving the motions of a cutting tool relative to a workpiece in a machining operation, and (3) pressing and sintering parts in a powder metallurgy process. Power is also used to accomplish any material handling activities needed in the process, such as loading and unloading parts, if these activities are not performed manually. Finally, power is used to operate the control system. \rThe activities in an automated process are determined by a program of instructions.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4571, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ece1915-e2f7-4b43-a762-91fc35ec9492": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ece1915-e2f7-4b43-a762-91fc35ec9492", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec37.txt", "file_name": "sec37.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 73282, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32850748-0777-4972-8db0-8666a0ac0b23", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec37.txt", "file_name": "sec37.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 73282, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "011c06de5b1a32cea580454e80cdef388a20f5bb68d079d282a9d4c214df331b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "37932564-11aa-4a5a-8375-0e33912805ca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec37.txt", "file_name": "sec37.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 73282, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "7dc6e7168563c52784fca904e020dfa4a45c5f5fae9d838e63e5a0a48ce77200", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "724ea065-d545-42f5-8f1b-323ffad5051e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5561409e6d7aebabf5849221305e57dc822822ac5fc9301582c7195548a19922", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In a manufacturing process, power is required to accomplish the activities associated with the particular process.

Power is also used to accomplish any material handling activities needed in the process, such as loading and unloading parts, if these activities are not performed manually. Finally, power is used to operate the control system. \rThe activities in an automated process are determined by a program of instructions. In the simplest automated processes, the only instruction may be to maintain a certain controlled variable at a speci\ufb01ed level, such as regulating the temperature in a heat treatment furnace. In more complex processes, a sequence of activities is required during the work cycle, and the order and details of each activity are de\ufb01ned by the program of instructions. Each activity involves changes in one or more process parameters, such as changing the x-coordinate position of a machine tool worktable, opening or closing a valve in a \ufb02uid \ufb02ow system, or turning a motor on or off. Process parameters are inputs to the process. They may be continuous (continuously variable over a given range, such as the x-position of a worktable) or discrete (On or Off). Their values affect the outputs of the process, which are called process variables. Like process parameters, process variables can be continuous or discrete. Examples include the actual position of the machine worktable, the rotational speed of a motor shaft, or whether a warning light is on or off. The program of instructions speci\ufb01es the changes in process parameters and when they should occur during the work cycle, and these changes determine the resulting values of the process variables. For example, in computer numerical control, the program of instructions is called a part program. The part program speci\ufb01es the individual sequence of steps required to machine a given part, including worktable and cutter positions, cutting speeds, feeds, and other details of the operation. \rIn some automated processes, the work cycle program must contain instructions for making decisions or reacting to unexpected events during the work cycle. Examples of situations requiring this kind of capability include (1) variations in raw materials that require adjusting certain process parameters to compensate, \r(2) interactions and communications with humans such as responding to requests for system status information, (3) safety monitoring requirements, and (4) equipment malfunctions. \rThe program of instructions is executed by a control system, the third basic component of an automated system. Two types of control system can be distinguished: closed loop and open loop. A closed-loop system, also known as a feedback control system, is one in which the process variable of interest (output of the process) is compared with the corresponding process parameter (input to the process), and any difference between them is used to drive the output value into agreement with the input. Figure 37.3(a) shows the six elements of a closed loop system: (1) input parameter, (2) process, (3) output variable, (4) feedback sensor, (5) controller, and (6) actuator. The input parameter represents the desired value of the output variable. The process is the operation or activity being controlled; more speci\ufb01cally, the output variable is being controlled by the system. A sensor is used to measure the output variable and feed back its value to the controller, which compares output with input and makes the required adjustment to reduce any difference. The adjustment \rFIGURE 37.3 \rTwo basic types of control systems:\r(a)\r closed loop and\r\r(b)\r open loop. \r\r\r37.1.2 \r\rSection 37.1/Automation Fundamentals 967 \r\r(a) \r\rInput parameter (b) \ris made by means of one or more actuators, which are hardware devices that physically accomplish the control actions. \rThe other type of control system is an open-loop system, presented in Figure 37.3(b).

On the other hand, the advantage of an open-loop system is that its cost is less than a comparable closed-loop system. \r\rTYPES OF AUTOMATION \rAutomated systems used in manufacturing can be classi\ufb01ed into three basic types: \r(1) \ufb01xed automation, (2) programmable automation, and (3) \ufb02exible automation. \rFixed Automation In \ufb01xed automation, the processing or assembly steps and their sequence are \ufb01xed by the equipment con\ufb01guration. The program of instructions is determined by the equipment design and cannot be easily changed. Each step in the sequence usually involves a simple action, such as feeding a rotating spindle along a linear trajectory. Although the work cycle consists of simple operations, integrating and coordinating the actions can result in the need for a rather sophisticated control system, and computer control is often required. \rTypical features of \ufb01xed automation include (1) high initial investment for specialized equipment, (2) high production rates, and (3) little or no \ufb02exibility to accommodate product variety. Automated systems with these features can be justi\ufb01ed for parts and products that are produced in very large quantities. The high investment cost can be spread over many units, thus making the cost per unit relatively low compared to alternative production methods. The automated production lines discussed in the following chapter are examples of \ufb01xed automation. \rProgrammable Automation As its name suggests, the equipment in programmable automation is designed with the capability to change the program of instructions to allow production of different parts or products. New programs can be prepared for new parts, and the equipment can read each program and execute the encoded instructions.Thus the features that characterize programmable automation are (1) high investment in general purpose equipment that can be reprogrammed, \r\r(2) lower production rates than \ufb01xed automation, (3) ability to cope with product variety by reprogramming the equipment, and (4) suitability for batch production of various part or product styles. Examples of programmable automation include computer numerical control and industrial robotics, discussed in Sections 37.3 and 37.4, respectively. \rFlexible Automation Suitability for batch production is mentioned as one of the features of programmable automation. As discussed in Chapter 1, the disadvantage of batch production is that lost production time occurs between batches due to equipment and/or tooling changeovers that are required to accommodate the next batch. Thus, programmable automation usually suffers from this disadvantage. Flexible automation is an extension of programmable automation in which there is virtually no lost production time for setup changes and/or reprogramming. Any required changes in the program of instructions and/or setup can be accomplished quickly; that is, within the time needed to move the next work unit into position at the machine. A \ufb02exible system is therefore capable of producing a mixture of different parts or products one right after the other instead of in batches.

Sensors are required to measure the process variables. Actuators are used to drive the process parameters. And various additional devices are needed to interface the sensors and actuators with the process controller, which is usually a digital computer. \r37.2.1 SENSORS \rA sensor is a device that converts a physical stimulus or variable of interest (e.g., temperature, force, pressure, or other characteristic of the process) into a more convenient physical form (e.g., electrical voltage) for the purpose of measuring the variable. The conversion allows the variable to be interpreted as a quantitative value. \rSensors of various types are available to collect data for feedback control in manufacturing automation. They are often classi\ufb01ed according to type of stimulus; thus, there are mechanical, electrical, thermal, radiation, magnetic, and chemical variables. Within each category, multiple variables can be measured. For example, within the mechanical category, the physical variables include position, velocity, force, torque, and many others.Electrical variables include voltage,current,and resistance.And so on for the other major categories. \rIn addition to type of stimulus,sensors are also classi\ufb01ed as analog or discrete.An analog sensor measures a continuous analog variable and converts it into a continuous signal such as electrical voltage. Thermocouples, strain gages, and ammeters are examples of analog sensors. A discrete sensor produces a signal that can have only a limited number of values. Within this category, there are binary sensors and digital sensors.A binary sensor can take on only two possible values, such as off and on, or 0 and 1.Limit switches operate this way.A digital sensor produces a digital output signal, either in the form of parallel status bits, such as a photoelectric sensor array) or a series of pulses that can be counted, such as an optical encoder. Digital sensors have an advantage that they can be readily interfaced to a digital computer, whereas the signals from analog sensors must be converted to digital to be read by the computer. \rFor a given sensor, there is a relationship between the value of the physical stimu\rlus and the value of the signal produced by the sensor.This input/output relationship \ris called the sensor\u2019s transfer function, which can be expressed as: \rS ! f(s) (37.1) \rwhere S ! the output signal of the sensor (typically voltage), s ! the stimulus or input, and f(s) is the functional relationship between them. The ideal form for an analog sensor is a proportional relationship: \rS ! C \" ms (37.2) \rwhere C ! the value of the sensor output when the stimulus value is zero, and m  the constant of proportionality between s and S. The constant m indicates how much the output S is affected by the input s. This is referred to as the sensitivity of the measuring device. For example, a standard Chromel/Alumel thermocouple produces 40.6 microvolts per degree C change in temperature. \rA binary sensor (e.g., limit switch, photoelectric switch) exhibits a binary relationship between stimulus and sensor output: \rS  1 if s > 0 and S  0 if s  0 (37.3) \rBefore a measuring device can be used, it must be calibrated, which basically means determining the transfer function of the sensor; speci\ufb01cally, how is the value of the stimulus s determined from the value of the output signal S? Ease of calibration is one criterion by which a measuring device can be selected. Other criteria include accuracy, precision, operating range, speed of response, reliability and cost. \r\r\r37.2.2 ACTUATORS \rIn automated systems, an actuator is a device that converts a control signal into a physical action, which usually refers to a change in a process input parameter.

The action is typically mechanical, such as a change in position of a worktable or rotational speed of a motor. The control signal is generally a low level signal, and an ampli\ufb01er may be required to increase the power of the signal to drive the actuator. \rActuators can be classi\ufb01ed according to type of ampli\ufb01er as (1) electrical, (2) hydraulic, or (3) pneumatic. Electrical actuators include AC and DC electric motors, stepper motors, and solenoids. The operations of two types of electric motors (servomotors and stepper motors) are described in Section 37.3.2, which deals with the analysis of positioning systems. Hydraulic actuators utilize hydraulic \ufb02uid to amplify the control signal and are often speci\ufb01ed when large forces are required in the application. Pneumatic actuators are driven by compressed air, which is commonly used in factories.All three actuator types are available as linear or rotational devices. This designation distinguishes whether the output action is a linear motion or a rotational motion. Electric motors and stepper motors are more common as rotational actuators, whereas most hydraulic and pneumatic actuators provide a linear output. \r\r\r37.2.3 INTERFACE DEVICES \rFIGURE 37.4 An analog-to-digitalconverter works byconverting a continuous analog signal intoa series of discrete sampled data. \rInterface devices allow the process to be connected to the computer controller and vice versa. Sensor signals from the manufacturing process are fed into the computer, and command signals are sent to actuators that operate the process. This section describes the hardware devices that enable this communication between the process and the controller. The devices include analog\u2013to\u2013digital converters, digital\u2013to\u2013 analog converters, contact input/output interfaces, and pulse counters and generators. \rContinuous analog signals from sensors attached to the process must be transformed into digital values that can be used by the control computer, a function that is accomplished by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). As illustrated in Figure 37.4, an ADC (1) samples the continuous signal at periodic intervals, (2) converts the sampled data into one of a \ufb01nite number of de\ufb01ned amplitude levels, and (3) encodes each amplitude level into a sequence of binary digits that can be interpreted by the control computer. Important characteristics of an analog-to-digital converter include sampling rate and resolution. Sampling rate is the frequency with which the continuous signal is sampled.A faster sampling rate means that the actual form of the continuous signal can be more closely approximated. Resolution refers to the precision with which the analog value can be converted into binary code.This depends on the number of bits used in the encoding procedure, the more bits, the higher the resolution. Unfortunately, using more bits requires more time to make the conversion, which can impose a practical limit on the sampling rate. \rA digital-to-analog converter (DAC) accomplishes the reverse process of the ADC. It converts the digital output of the control computer into a quasi-continuous signal capable of driving an analog actuator or other analog device. The DAC performs its function in two steps: (1) decoding, in which the sequence of digital output values is transformed into a corresponding series of analog values at discrete time intervals, and (2) data holding, in which each analog value is changed into a continuous signal during the duration of the time interval. In the simplest case, the \rVariable \r\rsampled signal \rFIGURE 37.5 \rAn analog-to-digitalconverter works byconverting a continuous analog signal intoa series of discrete sampled data. \r37.2.4 \r\rSection 37.2/Hardware for Automation  971 \r\r\rSeries of discrete \rcontinuous signal consists of a series of step functions, as in Figure 37.5, which are used to drive the analog actuator. \rMany automated systems operate by turning on and off motors, switches, and other devices to respond to conditions and as a function of time.

These control devices use binary variables. They can have either of two possible values, 1 or 0, interpreted as ON or OFF, object present or not present, high or low voltage level, and so on. Binary sensors commonly used in process control systems include limit switches and photocells. Common binary actuators solenoids, valves, clutches, lights, control relays, and certain motors. \rContact input/output interfaces are components used to communicate binary data back and forth between the process and the control computer. A contact input interface is a device that reads binary data into the computer from an external source. It consists of a series of binary electrical contacts that indicate the status of a binary device such as a limit switch attached to the process. The status of each contact is periodically scanned by the computer to update values used by the control program. A contact output interface is a device used to communicate on/off signals from the computer to external binary components such as solenoids, alarms, and indicator lights. It can also be used to turn on and off constant speed motors. \rAs mentioned earlier, discrete data sometimes exist in the form of a series of pulses. For example, an optical encoder (Section 37.3.2) emits its measurement of position and velocity as a series of pulses.A pulse counter is a device that converts a series of pulses from an external source into a digital value, which is entered into the control computer. In addition to reading the output of an optical encoder, applications of pulse counters include counting the number of parts \ufb02owing along a conveyor past a photoelectric sensor. The opposite of a pulse counter is a pulse generator, a device that produces a series of electrical pulses based on digital values generated by a control computer. Both the number and frequency of the pulses are controlled. An important pulse generator application is to drive stepper motors, which respond to each step by rotating through a small incremental angle, called a step angle. \r\rPROCESS CONTROLLERS \rMost process control systems use some type of digital computer as the controller. Whether control involves continuous or discrete parameters and variables, or a combination of continuous and discrete, a digital computer can be connected to the process to communicate and interact with it using the interface devices discussed in Section 37.2.3.

The major components of a PLC, shown in Figure 37.6, are (1) input and output modules, which connect the PLC to the industrial equipment to be controlled; (2) processor \u2014 the central processing unit (CPU), which executes the logic and sequencing functions to control the process by operating on the input signals and determining the proper output signals speci\ufb01ed by the control program; (3) PLC memory, which is connected to the processor and contains the logic and sequencing instructions; (4) power supply \r\u2014 115 V AC is typically used to drive the PLC. In addition, (5) a programming device (usually detachable) is used to enter the program into the PLC. \rExternal power source \r\r\rProgramming involves entry of the control instructions to the PLC using the programming device. The most common control instructions include logical operations, sequencing, counting, and timing. Many control applications require additional instructions for analog control, data processing, and computations. A variety of PLC programming languages have been developed, ranging from ladder logic diagrams to structured text. A discussion of these languages is beyond the scope of this text, and the interested reader should consult the end-of-chapter references. \rAdvantages associated with programmable logic controllers include (1) programming a PLC is easier than wiring a relay control panel; (2) PLCs can be reprogrammed, whereas conventional hard-wired controls must be rewired and are often scrapped instead because of the dif\ufb01culty in rewiring; (3) a PLC can be interfaced with the plant computer system more readily than conventional controls; (4) PLCs require less \ufb02oor space than relay controls, and (5) PLCs offer greater reliability and easier maintenance. \r\r\r\r\rComputer Numerical Control \rNumerical control (NC) is a form of programmable automation in which the mechanical actions of a piece of equipment are controlled by a program containing coded alphanumeric data. The data represent relative positions between a work head and a work part. The work head is a tool or other processing element, and the work part is the object being processed. The operating principle of NC is to control the motion of the work head relative to the work part and to control the sequence in which the motions are carried out. The \ufb01rst application of numerical control was in machining (Historical Note 37.1), and this is still an important application area. NC machine tools are shown in Figures 21.26 and 21.27. \r\rHistorical Note 37.1 Numerical control [3], [5] \rThe initial development work on numerical control is credited to John Parsons and Frank Stulen at the Parsons Corporation in Michigan in the late 1940s. Parsons was a machining contractor for the Air Force and had devised a means of using numerical coordinate data to move the worktable of a milling machine for producing complex parts for aircraft. On the basis of Parson\u2019s work, the U.S. Air Force awarded a contract to the company in 1949 to study the feasibility of the new control concept for machine tools. The project was subcontracted to the MassachusettsInstituteofTechnologytodevelop a prototype machine tool that utilized the new numerical data principle. The M.I.T. study con\ufb01rmed that the concept was feasible and proceeded to adapt a three-axis vertical milling machine using combined analog-digital controls.

The project was subcontracted to the MassachusettsInstituteofTechnologytodevelop a prototype machine tool that utilized the new numerical data principle. The M.I.T. study con\ufb01rmed that the concept was feasible and proceeded to adapt a three-axis vertical milling machine using combined analog-digital controls. The name numerical control (NC) was given to the system by which the machine tool motions were accomplished. The prototype machine was demonstrated in 1952. \rThe accuracy and repeatability of the NC system was far better than the manual machining methods then available. The potential for reducing nonproductive time in the machining cycle was also apparent. In 1956, the Air Force sponsored the development of NC machine tools at several different companies. These machines were placed in operation at various aircraft plants between 1958 and 1960. The advantages of NC soon became clear, and aerospace companies began placing orders for new NC machines. \rThe importance of part programming was clear from the start. The Air Force continued to encourage the development and application of NC by sponsoring research at M.I.T. for a part programming language to control NC machines. This research resulted in the development of APT in 1958 (APT stands for Automatically Programmed Tooling). APT is a part programming language by which a user could write the machining instructions in simple English-like statements, and the statements were coded to be interpreted by the NC system. \r\r\r37.3.1 THE TECHNOLOGY OF NUMERICAL CONTROL \rThis section de\ufb01nes the components of a numerical control system and describes the coordinate axis system and motion controls. \rComponents of an NC System A numerical control system consists of three basic components: (1) part program, (2) machine control unit, and (3) processing equipment. The part program (the term commonly used in machine tool technology) is the detailed set of commands to be followed by the processing equipment. It is the program of instructions in the NC control system. Each command speci\ufb01es a position or motion that is to be accomplished by the work head relative to the work part. A position is de\ufb01ned by its x-y-z coordinates. In machine tool applications, additional details in the NC program include spindle rotation speed, spindle direction, feed rate, tool change instructions, and other commands related to the operation. The part program is prepared by a part programmer, a person who is familiar with the details of the programming language and also understands the technology of the processing equipment. \rThe machine control unit (MCU) in modern NC technology is a microcomputer that stores and executes the program by converting each command into actions by the processing equipment, one command at a time. The MCU consists of both hardware and software.The hardware includes the microcomputer,components to interface with the processing equipment,and certain feedback control elements.The software in the MCU includes control system software, calculation algorithms, and translation software to convert the NC part program into a usable format for the MCU. The MCU also permits the part program to be edited in case the program contains errors, or changes in cutting conditions are required. Because the MCU is a computer, the term computer numerical control (CNC) is often used to distinguish this type of NC from its technological predecessors that were based entirely on hard-wired electronics. \rThe processing equipment accomplishes the sequence of processing steps to transform the starting work part into a completed part. It operates under the control of the MCU according to the instructions in the part program. The variety of applications and processing equipment are surveyed in Section 37.3.4. \rCoordinate System and Motion Control in NC A standard coordinate axis system is used to specify positions in numerical control. The system consists of the three linear axes (x, y, z) of the Cartesian coordinate system, plus three rotational axes (a, b, c), as shown in Figure 37.7(a). The rotational axes are used to rotate the work part to present different surfaces for machining, or to orient the tool or work head at some angle relative to the part. Most NC systems do not require all six axes. The simplest NC systems (e.g., plotters, pressworking machines for \ufb02at sheet-metal stock, and component insertion machines) are positioning systems whose locations can be de\ufb01ned in an x-y plane. Programming of these machines involves specifying a sequence of x-y coordinates.

Programming of these machines involves specifying a sequence of x-y coordinates. By contrast, some machine tools have \ufb01ve-axis control to shape complex work part geometries. These systems typically include three linear axes plus two rotational axes. \r\rThe coordinates for a rotational NC system are illustrated in Figure 37.7(b).These systems are associated with turning operations on NC lathes. Although the work rotates,this is not one of the controlled axes in a conventional NC turning system.The cutting path of the tool relative to the rotating workpiece is de\ufb01ned in the x-z plane, as shown in the \ufb01gure. \rIn many NC systems, the relative movements between the processing tool and the work part are accomplished by \ufb01xing the part to a worktable and then controlling the positions and motions of the table relative to a stationary or semi-stationary work head. Most machine tools and component insertion machines are based on this method of operation. In other systems, the work part is held stationary and the work head is moved along two or three axes. Flame cutters, x-y plotters, and coordinate measuring machines operate in this mode. \rMotion control systems based on NC can be divided into two types: (1) pointto-point and (2) continuous path. Point-to-point systems, also called positioning systems, move the work head (or workpiece) to a programmed location with no regard for the path taken to get to that location. Once the move is completed, some processing action is accomplished by the work head at the location, such as drilling or punching a hole. Thus, the program consists of a series of point locations at which operations are performed. \rContinuous path systems provide continuous simultaneous control of more than one axis, thus controlling the path followed by the tool relative to the part. This permits the tool to perform a process while the axes are moving, enabling the system to generate angular surfaces, two-dimensional curves, or three-dimensional contours in the work part. This operating scheme is required in drafting machines, certain milling and turning operations, and \ufb02ame cutting. In machining, continuous path control also goes by the name contouring. \rAn important aspect of continuous path motion is interpolation, which is concerned with calculating the intermediate points along a path to be followed by the work head relative to the part. Two common forms of interpolation are linear and circular. Linear interpolation is used for straight line paths, in which the part programmer speci\ufb01es the coordinates of the beginning point and end point of the straight line as well as the feed rate to be used. The interpolator then computes the travel speeds of the two or three axes that will accomplish the speci\ufb01ed trajectory. Circular interpolation allows the work head to follow a circular arc by specifying the coordinates of its beginning and end points together with either the center or radius of the arc. The interpolator computes a series of small straight line segments that will approximate the arc within a de\ufb01ned tolerance. \rAnother aspect of motion control is concerned with whether the positions in the coordinate system are de\ufb01ned absolutely or incrementally. In absolute positioning, the work head locations are always de\ufb01ned with respect to the origin of the axis system. In incremental positioning, the next work head position is de\ufb01ned relative to the present location. The difference is illustrated in Figure 37.8. \r\rFIGURE 37.8 Absolute vs. incremental positioning. The workhead is at point (2, 3) and is to bemoved to point (6, 8).

Consider how a simple positioning system, shown in Figure 37.9, might operate. The system consists of a worktable on which a work part is \ufb01xtured. The purpose of the table is to move the part relative to a tool or work head. To accomplish this purpose, the worktable is moved linearly by means of a rotating leadscrew that is driven by a motor. For simplicity, only one axis is shown in the sketch. To provide x-y capability, the system shown would be piggybacked on top of a second axis perpendicular to the \ufb01rst.The leadscrew has a certain pitch p, mm/thread (in/thread) or mm/rev (in/rev). Thus, the table is moved a distance equal to the leadscrew pitch for each revolution.The velocity at which the worktable moves is determined by the rotational speed of the leadscrew. \rTwo basic types of motion control are used in NC: (a) open loop and (b) closed loop, as shown in Figure 37.10. The difference is that an open-loop system operates without verifying that the desired position of the worktable has been achieved. A closed-loop control system uses feedback measurement to verify that the position of the worktable is indeed the location speci\ufb01ed in the program. Open-loop systems are less expensive than closed-loop systems and are appropriate when the force resisting the actuating motion is minimal, as in point-to-point drilling, for example. Closed-loop systems are normally speci\ufb01ed for machine tools that perform continuous path operations such as milling or turning, in which the resisting forces can be signi\ufb01cant. \r\r\r(b) closed loop. \rOpen-Loop Positioning Systems To turn the leadscrew, an open-loop positioning system typically uses a stepping motor (a.k.a. stepper motor). In NC, the stepping motor is driven by a series of electrical pulses generated by the machine control unit. Each pulse causes the motor to rotate a fraction of one revolution, called the step angle. The allowable step angles must conform to the relationship \ra ! 360 \r(37.4)\rns \rwhere a ! step angle, degrees; and ns ! the number of step angles for the motor, which must be an integer. The angle through which the motor shaft rotates is given by \rAm ! anp (37.5) \rwhere Am ! angle of motor shaft rotation, degrees; np ! number of pulses received by the motor; and a ! step angle, here de\ufb01ned as degrees/pulse. Finally, the rotational speed of the motor shaft is determined by the frequency of pulses sent to the motor: \r60 a fp\rNm ! (37.6)\r360 \rwhere Nm ! speed of motor shaft rotation, rev/min; fp ! frequency of pulses driving the stepper motor, Hz (pulses/sec), the constant 60 converts pulses/sec to pulses/min; the constant 360 converts degrees of rotation to full revolutions; and a  step angle of the motor, as before. \rThe motor shaft drives the leadscrew that determines the position and velocity of the worktable. The connection is often designed using a gear reduction to increase the precision of table movement. However, the angle of rotation and rotational speed of the leadscrew are reduced by this gear ratio.

It consists of a light source, a photocell, and a disk containing a series of slots through which the light source can shine to energize the photocell.The disk is connected to a rotating shaft,which in turn is connected directly to the leadscrew. As the leadscrew rotates, the slots cause the light source to be seen by the photocell as a series of \ufb02ashes, which are converted into an equivalent series of electrical pulses. By counting the pulses and computing the frequency of the pulse train, the leadscrew angle and rotational speed can be determined, and thus worktable position and speed can be calculated using the pitch of the leadscrew. \rThe equations describing the operation of a closed-loop positioning system are analogous to those for an open-loop system.

As with the open-loop system, a gear reduction between the servomotor and the leadscrew can also be used,so Equations (37.7 a,b) are applicable.A digitalto-analog converter is used to convert the digital signals used by the MCU into a continuous analog signal to operate the drive motor.

Most metal-machining operations fall into this category, particularly those involving continuous path control such as milling and turning. \r\rAn NC worktable is driven by a closed-loop positioning system consisting of a servomotor, leadscrew, and optical encoder.

Control resolution is de\ufb01ned as the distance separating two adjacent control points in the axis movement. Control points are sometimes called addressable points because they are locations along the axis to which the worktable can be directed to go. It is desirable for the control resolutionto be as small as possible.Thisdepends on limitations imposed by (1) the electromechanical components of the positioning system, and/or \r(2) the number of bits used by the controller to de\ufb01ne the axis coordinate location. \rThe electromechanical factors that limit resolution include leadscrew pitch, gear ratio in the drive system, and the step angle in a stepping motor (for an open-loop system) or the angle between slots in an encoder disk (for a closed-loop system). Together, these factors determine a control resolution, or minimum distance that the worktable can be moved.

It is usually accomplished by someone familiar with the metalworking process who has learned the programming procedure for the particular equipment in the plant. For other processes, other terms may be used for programming, but the principles are similar and a trained individual is needed to prepare the program. Computer systems are used extensively to prepare NC programs. \rPart programming requires the programmer to de\ufb01ne the points, lines, and surfaces of the work part in the axis system, and to control the movement of the cutting tool relative to these de\ufb01ned part features. Several part programming techniques are available, the most important of which are (1) manual part programming, (2) computer-assisted part programming, (3) CAD/CAM-assisted part programming, and (4) manual data input. \rManual Part Programming For simple point-to-point machining jobs, such as drilling operations, manual programming is often the easiest and most economical method.

The complete NC part program consists of a sequence of statements similar to the above command. \rComputer-Assisted Part Programming Computer-assisted part programming involves the use of a high-level programming language. It is suited to the programming of more complex jobs than manual programming. The \ufb01rst part programming language was APT (Automatically Programmed Tooling), developed as an extension of the original NC machine tool research and \ufb01rst used in production around 1960. \rIn APT, the part programming task is divided into two steps: (1) de\ufb01 nition of part geometry and (2) speci\ufb01 cation of tool path and operation sequence. In step 1, the part programmer de\ufb01nes the geometry of the work part by means of basic geometric elements such as points, lines, planes, circles, and cylinders. These elements are de\ufb01 ned using APT geometry statements, such as \rP1  POINT/25.0, 150.0 L1  LINE/P1, P2 \r\rP1 is a point de\ufb01ned in the x-y plane located at x  25 mm and y  150 mm. L1 is a line that goes through points P1 and P2. Similar statements can be used to de\ufb01 ne circles, cylinders, and other geometry elements. Most work part shapes can be described using statements like these to de\ufb01ne their surfaces, corners, edges, and hole locations. \rSpeci\ufb01cation of the tool path is accomplished with APT motion statements. A typical statement for point-to-point operation is \rGOTO/P1 \rThis directs the tool to move from its current location to a position de\ufb01ned by P1, where P1 has been de\ufb01ned by a previous APT geometry statement. Continuous path commands use geometry elements such as lines, circles, and planes. For example, the command \rGORGT/L3, PAST, L4 \rdirects the tool to go right (GORGT) along line L3 until it is positioned just past line L4 (of course, L4 must be a line that intersects L3). \rAdditional APT statements are used to de\ufb01ne operating parameters such as feed rates, spindle speeds, tool sizes, and tolerances. When completed, the part programmer enters the APT program into the computer, where it is processed to generate low-level statements (similar to statements prepared in manual part programming) that can be used by a particular machine tool. \rCAD/CAM-Assisted Part Programming The use of CAD/CAM takes computer-assisted part programming a step further by using a computer graphics system (CAD/CAM system) to interact with the programmer as the part program is being prepared. In the conventional use of APT, a complete program is written and then entered into the computer for processing. Many programming errors are not detected until computer processing. When a CAD/CAM system is used, the programmer receives immediate visual veri\ufb01cation when each statement is entered, to determine whether the statement is correct. When part geometry is entered by the programmer, the element is graphically displayed on the monitor. When the tool path is constructed, the programmer can see exactly how the motion commands will move the tool relative to the part. Errors can be corrected immediately rather than after the entire program has been written. \rInteraction between programmer and programming system is a signi\ufb01cant bene\ufb01t of CAD/CAM-assisted programming. There are other important bene\ufb01ts of using CAD/CAM in NC part programming. First, the design of the product and its components may have been accomplished on a CAD/CAM system.

This retrieval saves valuable time compared to reconstructing the part from scratch using the APT geometry statements. \rSecond, special software routines are available in CAD/CAM-assisted part programming to automate portions of the tool path generation, such as pro\ufb01le milling around the outside periphery of a part, milling a pocket into the surface of a part, surface contouring, and certain point-to-point operations. These routines are called by the part programmer as special macro commands. Their use results in signi\ufb01cant savings in programming time and effort. \rManual Data Input Manual data input (MDI) is a method in which a machine operator enters the part program in the factory. The method involves use of a CRT display with graphics capability at the machine tool controls. NC part programming statements are entered using a menu-driven procedure that requires minimum training of the machine tool operator. Because part programming is simpli\ufb01ed and does not require a special staff of NC part programmers, MDI is a way for small machine shops to economically implement numerical control into their operations. \r\r\r37.3.4 APPLICATIONS OF NUMERICAL CONTROL \r\rMachining is an important application area for numerical control, but the operating principle of NC can be applied to other operations as well.There are many industrial processes in which the position of a work head must be controlled relative to the part or product being worked on. The applications are divided into two categories: \r(1) machine tool applications and (2) nonmachine tool applications. It should be noted that the applications are not all identi\ufb01ed by the name numerical control in their respective industries. \rIn the machine tool category, NC is widely used for machining operations such as turning, drilling, and milling (Sections 21.2, 21.3, and 21.4, respectively). The use of NC in these processes has motivated the development of highly automated machine tools called machining centers, which change their own cutting tools to perform a variety of machining operations under NC program control (Section 21.5). In addition to machining, other numerically controlled machine tools include (1) grinding machines (Section 24.1); (2) sheet metal pressworking machines (Section 19.5.2); (3) tube-bending machines (Section 19.7); and (4) thermal cutting processes (Section 25.3). \rIn the nonmachine tool category, NC applications include (1) tape-laying machines and \ufb01lament-winding machines for composites (Sections 14.2.3 and 14.4.1); \r(2) \rwelding machines, both arc welding (Section 30.1) and resistance welding (Section 30.2); (3) component placement and insertion machines in electronics assembly (Sections 34.3.1 and 34.3.2); (4) drafting machines; and (5) coordinate measuring machines for inspection (Section 40.6.1). \r\rBene\ufb01ts of NC relative to manually operated equipment in these applications include (1) reduced nonproductive time, which results in shorter cycle times, (2) lower manufacturing lead times, (3) simpler \ufb01xturing, (4) greater manufacturing \ufb02exibility, \r\r(5)\r improved accuracy, and (6) reduced human error. \r\r\r\r\rIndustrial Robotics \rAn industrial robot is a general-purpose programmable machine possessing certain anthropomorphic features. The most obvious anthropomorphic, or human-like, feature is the robot\u2019s mechanical arm, or manipulator.

The most obvious anthropomorphic, or human-like, feature is the robot\u2019s mechanical arm, or manipulator. The control unit for a modern industrial robot is a computer that can be programmed to execute rather sophisticated subroutines, thus providing the robot with an intelligence that sometimes seems almost human. The robot\u2019s manipulator, combined with a high-level controller, allows an industrial robot to perform a variety of tasks such as loading and unloading production machine, spot welding, and spray painting. Robots are typically used as substitutes for human workers in these tasks. The \ufb01rst industrial robot was installed in a die-casting operation at Ford Motor Company.The robot\u2019s job was to unload die castings from the die-casting machine. \rThis section considers various aspects of robot technology and applications, including how industrial robots are programmed to perform their tasks. \r37.4.1 ROBOT ANATOMY \rAn industrial robot consists of a mechanical manipulator and a controller to move it and perform other related functions. The mechanical manipulator consists of joints and links that can position and orient the end of the manipulator relative to its base. The controller unit consists of electronic hardware and software to operate the joints in a coordinated fashion to execute the programmed work cycle. Robot anatomy is concerned with the mechanical manipulator and its construction. Figure 37.13 shows one of the common industrial robot con\ufb01gurations. \rManipulator Joints and Links A joint in a robot is similar to a joint in a human body. It provides relative movement between two parts of the body. Connected to each joint are an input link and an output link. Each joint moves its output link relative to its input link.The robot manipulator consists of a series of link\u2013joint\u2013link combinations.The output link of one joint is the input link for the next joint.Typical industrial robots have \ufb01ve or six joints. The coordinated movement of these joints gives the robot its ability to move, position, and orient objects to perform useful work. Manipulator joints can be classi\ufb01ed as linear or rotating, indicating the motion of the output link relative to the input link. \r\rFIGURE 37.13 \rThe manipulator of amodern industrial robot. (Photo courtesy ofAdept Technology, Inc.) \r\rManipulator Design Using joints of the two basic types, each joint separated from the previous by a link, the manipulator is constructed. Most industrial robots are mounted to the \ufb02oor. The base is link 0; this is the input link to joint 1 whose output is link 1, which is the input to joint 2 whose output link is link 2; and so forth, for the number of joints in the manipulator. \rRobot manipulators can usually be divided into two sections: arm-and-body assembly and wrist assembly. There are typically three joints associated with the armand-body assembly, and two or three joints associated with the wrist. The function of the arm-and-body is to position an object or tool, and the wrist function is to properly orient the object or tool. Positioning is concerned with moving the part or tool from one location to another. Orientation is concerned with precisely aligning the object relative to some stationary location in the work area. \rTo accomplish these functions, arm-and-body designs differ from those of the wrist. Positioning requires large spatial movements, while orientation requires twisting and rotating motions to align the part or tool relative to a \ufb01 xed position in the workplace. The arm-and-body consists of large links and joints, whereas the wrist consists of short links.The arm-and-body joints often consist of both linear and rotating types, while the wrist joints are almost always rotating types.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 60171, "end_char_idx": 64347, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55ab0a12-6f0a-4cda-abf7-6659405a05ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "55ab0a12-6f0a-4cda-abf7-6659405a05ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec37.txt", "file_name": "sec37.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 73282, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32850748-0777-4972-8db0-8666a0ac0b23", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec37.txt", "file_name": "sec37.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 73282, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "011c06de5b1a32cea580454e80cdef388a20f5bb68d079d282a9d4c214df331b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7c7e97d1-b9ce-4b36-a1cb-7df03b739e8e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec37.txt", "file_name": "sec37.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 73282, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "da501ae1309d37bda404ce960aae41eba07f76bc9346ff68629e35bfa3fb4a8c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fd066bbd-b968-40f4-bf38-746b1875616f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c63d0b44fba4270e120dd6323ed67920f6c9f6a8ddac399d3416e0f7db05686f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "There are typically three joints associated with the armand-body assembly, and two or three joints associated with the wrist.

The arm-and-body consists of large links and joints, whereas the wrist consists of short links.The arm-and-body joints often consist of both linear and rotating types, while the wrist joints are almost always rotating types. \rThere are \ufb01ve basic arm-and-body con\ufb01gurations available in commercial robots, identi\ufb01ed in Figure 37.14.The design shown in part (e) of the \ufb01gure and in Figure 37.13 \r\ris called a SCARA robot, which stands for \u201cselectively compliant assembly robot arm.\u201d It is similar to a jointed arm anatomy, except that the shoulder and elbow joints have vertical axes of rotation, thus providing rigidity in the vertical direction but relative compliance in the horizontal direction. \rThe wrist is assembled to the last link in any of these arm-and-body con\ufb01 gurations. The SCARA is sometimes an exception because it is almost always used for simple handling and assembly tasks involving vertical motions.Therefore,a wrist is not usually present at the end of its manipulator. Substituting for the wrist on the SCARA is usually a gripper to grasp components for movement and/or assembly. \rWork Volume and Precision of Motion One of the important technical considerations of an industrial robot is the size of its work volume. Work volume is de\ufb01ned as the envelope within which a robot manipulator can position and orient the end of its wrist. This envelope is determined by the number of joints, as well as their types and ranges, and the sizes of the links. Work volume is important because it plays a signi\ufb01cant role in determining which applications a robot can perform. \rThe de\ufb01nitions of control resolution, accuracy, and repeatability developed in Section 37.3.2 for NC positioning systems apply to industrial robots. A robot manipulator is, after all, a positioning system. In general, the links and joints of robots are not nearly as rigid as their machine tool counterparts, and so the accuracy and repeatability of their movements are not as good. \rEnd Effectors An industrial robot is a general-purpose machine. For a robot to be useful in a particular application, it must be equipped with special tooling designed for the application.An end effector is the special tooling that connects to the robot\u2019s wrist-end to perform the speci\ufb01c task. There are two general types of end effector: tools and grippers. A tool is used when the robot must perform a processing operation. The special tools include spot-welding guns, arc-welding tools, spray-painting nozzles, rotating spindles, heating torches, and assembly tools (e.g., automatic screwdriver). The robot is programmed to manipulate the tool relative to the work part being processed. \rGrippers are designed to grasp and move objects during the work cycle. The objects are usually work parts, and the end effector must be designed speci\ufb01cally for the part. Grippers are used for part placement applications, machine loading and unloading, and palletizing. Figure 37.15 shows a typical gripper con\ufb01guration. \r\r\r\r37.4.2 CONTROL SYSTEMS AND ROBOT PROGRAMMING \rThe robot\u2019s controller consists of the electronic hardware and software to control the joints during execution of a programmed work cycle. Most robot control units today are based on a microcomputer system. The control systems in robotics can be classi\ufb01ed as follows: \r1. \rPlayback with point-to-point (PTP) control.

Most robot control units today are based on a microcomputer system. The control systems in robotics can be classi\ufb01ed as follows: \r1. \rPlayback with point-to-point (PTP) control. As in numerical control, robot motion systems can be divided into point-to-point and continuous path. The program for a point-to-point playback robot consists of a series of point locations and the sequence in which these points must be visited during the work cycle. During programming, these points are recorded into memory, and then subsequently played back during execution of the program. In a pointto-point motion, the path taken to get to the \ufb01nal position is not controlled. \r\r2. \rPlayback with continuous path (CP) control. Continuous path control is similar to PTP, except motion paths rather than individual points are stored in memory. In certain types of regular CP motions, such as a straight line path between two point locations, the trajectory required by the manipulator is computed by the controller unit for each move. For irregular continuous motions, such as a path followed in spray painting, the path is de\ufb01ned by a series of closely spaced points that approximate the irregular smooth path. Robots capable of continuous path motions can also execute point-to-point movements. \r\r3. \rIntelligent control. Modern industrial robots exhibit characteristics that often make them appear to be acting intelligently. These characteristics include the ability to respond to sophisticated sensors such as machine vision, make decisions when things go wrong during the work cycle, make computations, and communicate with humans. Robot intelligence is implemented using powerful microprocessors and advanced programming techniques. \r\r\rRobots execute a stored program of instructions that de\ufb01ne the sequence of motions and positions in the work cycle, much like a part program in NC. In addition to motion instructions, the program may include instructions for other functions such as interacting with external equipment, responding to sensors, and processing data. \rThere are two basic methods used to teach modern robots their programs: leadthrough programming and computer programming languages. Leadthrough programming involves a \u201cteach-by-showing\u201d method in which the manipulator is moved by the programmer through the sequence of positions in the work cycle. The controller records each position in memory for subsequent playback. Two procedures for leading the robot through the motion sequence are available: powered leadthrough and manual leadthrough. In powered leadthrough, the manipulator is driven by a control box that has toggle switches or press buttons to control the movements of the joints. Using the control box, the programmer moves the manipulator to each location, recording the corresponding joint positions into memory. Powered leadthrough is the common method for programming playback robots with point-to-point control. Manual leadthrough is typically used for playback robots with continuous path control. In this method, the programmer physically moves the manipulator wrist through the motion cycle. For spray painting and certain other jobs, this is a more convenient means of programming the robot. \rComputer programming languages for programming robots have evolved from the use of microcomputer controllers.The \ufb01rst commercial language was introduced around 1979. Computer languages provide a convenient way to integrate certain nonmotion functions into the work cycle, such as decision logic, interlocking with other equipment, and interfacing with sensors. A more thorough discussion of robot programming is presented in reference [6]. \r\r37.4.3 APPLICATIONS OF INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS \rSome industrial work lends itself to robot applications. The following are the important characteristics of a work situation that tend to promote the substitution of a robot in place of a human worker: (1) the work environment is hazardous for humans, (2) the work cycle is repetitive, (3) the work is performed at a stationary location, (4) part or tool handling would be dif\ufb01cult for humans, (5) it is a multishift operation, (6) there are long production runs and infrequent changeovers, and (7) part positioning and orientation are established at the beginning of the work cycle, since most robots cannot see. \rApplications of industrial robots that tend to match these characteristics can be divided into three basic categories: (1) material handling, (2) processing operations, and (3) assembly and inspection.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 67058, "end_char_idx": 71819, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f5b99ca-78df-4598-bf9d-0def6881893e": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f5b99ca-78df-4598-bf9d-0def6881893e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec37.txt", "file_name": "sec37.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 73282, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32850748-0777-4972-8db0-8666a0ac0b23", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec37.txt", "file_name": "sec37.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 73282, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "011c06de5b1a32cea580454e80cdef388a20f5bb68d079d282a9d4c214df331b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd066bbd-b968-40f4-bf38-746b1875616f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec37.txt", "file_name": "sec37.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 73282, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "93e7eeb8438100086e07ccb2473bf32e4c0e6ac1559a860c35e09a52e2b0deea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "37.4.3 APPLICATIONS OF INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS \rSome industrial work lends itself to robot applications.

In addition, most of these systems use computer control to coordinate the actions of the stations and material handling equipment and to collect data on overall system performance. Thus, the components of an integrated manufacturing system are (1) workstations and/or machines, (2) material handling equipment, and (3) computer control. In addition, human workers are required to manage the system, and workers may be used to operate the individual workstations and machines. \rIntegrated manufacturing systems include manual and automated production lines, manufacturing cells (from which the term \u201ccellular manufacturing\u201d is derived), and \ufb02exible manufacturing systems, all of which are described in this chapter. The \ufb01nal section de\ufb01nes computer integrated manufacturing (CIM), the ultimate integrated manufacturing system. It is appropriate to begin this chapter with a concise overview of material handling, the physical integrator in integrated manufacturing systems. \r\r\r\rMaterial Handling \rMaterial handling is de\ufb01 ned as \u201cthe movement, storage, protection and control of materials throughout the manufacturing and distribution process . . .\u201d1 The term is usually associated with activities that occur inside a facility, as contrasted with transportation between facilities that involves rail, truck, air, or waterway delivery of goods. \r1This de\ufb01nition is published each year in the Annual Report of The Material Handling Industry of America (MHIA), the trade association for material handling companies doing business in North America. \rMaterials must be moved during the sequence of manufacturing operations that convert them into \ufb01nal products. Material handling functions in manufacturing include (1) loading and positioning work units at each workstation, (2) unloading work units from the station, and (3) transporting work units between workstations. Loading involves moving the work units into the production machine from a location in close proximity to or within the workstation. Positioning means locating the work units in a \ufb01xed orientation relative to the processing or assembly operation.At the end of the operation, the work units are unloaded or removed from the station. Loading and unloading are accomplished manually or by automated devices such as industrial robots. If the manufacturing operations require multiple workstations, then the units must be transported from one station to the next in the sequence. In many cases, a temporary storage function must also be provided by the material handling system, as work units await their turn at each workstation. The purpose of storage in this instance is to make sure that work is always present at each station, so that idle time of workers and equipment is avoided. \rMaterial handling equipment and methods used in manufacturing can be \rdivided into the following general categories: (1) material transport, (2) storage, \rand (3) unitizing. \rMaterial transport equipment is used to move parts and materials between workstations in the factory.This movement may include intermediate stops for temporary storage of work-in-process. There are \ufb01ve main types of material transport equipment: (1) industrial trucks, the most important of which are fork lift trucks, (2) automated guided vehicles, (3) rail-guided vehicles, (4) conveyors, and (5) hoists and cranes. This equipment is brie\ufb02y described in Table 38.1. \rTwo general categories of material transport equipment can be distinguished, according to the type of routing between workstations: \ufb01xed and variable. In \ufb01xed routing, all of the work units are moved through the same sequence of stations.

Storage systems can be classi\ufb01ed into two general categories: (1) conventional storage methods and equipment, which include bulk storage in an open area, rack systems, and shelves; and (2) automated storage systems, which include rack systems served by automatic cranes that store and retrieve pallet loads. \rFinally, unitizing refers to containers used to hold individual items during transport and storage, as well as equipment used to make up such unit loads. Containers include pallets, tote pans, boxes, and baskets that hold parts during handling. Unitizing equipment includes palletizers that are used to load and stack cartons onto pallets and depalletizers that are used to accomplish the unloading operation. Palletizers and depalletizers are generally associated with cartons of \ufb01nished product leaving a facility and boxes of raw materials coming into the facility, respectively. \rSection 1.4.1 describes four types of plant layout: (1) \ufb01 xed position layout, (2) process layout, (3) cellular layout, and (4) product layout. In general, different types of material handling methods and equipment are associated with these four types, as summarized in Table 38.2. \rTABLE \u2022 38.2 Types of material handling methods and systems generally associated with the four types of plant layout. \r\r\r\r\rWorkstations \rtasks in sync. One problem associated with manual methods of work transport is the dif\ufb01 culty in controlling the production rate on the line. Workers tend to work at a slower pace unless some mechanical means of pacing them is provided. \rMechanized Methods of Work Transport Powered mechanical systems are commonly used to move work units along a production line. These systems include liftand-carry devices, pick-and-place mechanisms, powered conveyors (e.g., overhead chain conveyors, belt conveyors, and chain-in-\ufb02oor conveyors), and other material handling equipment, sometimes combining several types on the same line.

In the second case, the product is small enough that it can be removed from the conveyor to facilitate the work at each station. Some of the pacing bene\ufb01ts are lost in this arrangement, since each worker is not required to \ufb01nish the assigned tasks within a \ufb01xed time period. On the other hand, this case allows greater \ufb02exibility to each worker to deal with any technical problems that may be encountered on a particular work unit. \rIn synchronous transfer systems, work units are simultaneously moved between stations with a quick, discontinuous motion. These systems are also known by the name intermittent transfer, which characterizes the type of motion experienced by the work units. Synchronous transfer includes positioning of the work at the stations, which is a requirement for automated lines that use this mode of transfer. Synchronous transfer is not common for manual lines, because the task at each and every station must be \ufb01nished within the cycle time or the product will leave the station as an incomplete unit. This rigid pacing discipline is stressful to human workers. By contrast, this type of pacing lends itself to automated operation. \rAsynchronous transfer allows each work unit to depart its current station when processing has been completed. Each unit moves independently, rather than synchronously. Thus, at any given moment, some units on the line are moving between stations, while others are positioned at stations. Associated with the operation of an asynchronous transfer system is the tactical use of queues between stations. Small queues of work units are permitted to form in front of each station, so that variations in worker task times will be averaged and stations will always have work waiting for them. Asynchronous transfer is used for both manual and automated manufacturing systems. \r38.2.2 PRODUCT VARIATIONS \rProduction lines can be designed to cope with variations in product models. Three types of line can be distinguished: (1) single model line, (2) batch model line, and \r(3) mixed model line. A single model line is one that produces only one model, and there is no variation in the model. Thus, the tasks performed at each station are the same on all product units. \r\rBatch model and mixed model lines are designed to produce two or more different product models on the same line, but they use different approaches for dealing with the model variations. As its name suggests, a batch model line produces each model in batches.The workstations are set up to produce the desired quantity of the \ufb01rst model; then the stations are recon\ufb01gured to produce the desired quantity of the next model; and so on. Production time is lost between batches due to the setup changes. Assembled products are often made using this approach when the demand for each product is medium and the product variety is also medium. The economics in this case favor the use of one production line for several products rather than using many separate lines for each model. \rA mixed model line also produces multiple models; however, the models are intermixed on the same line rather than being produced in batches. While a particular model is being worked on at one station, a different model is being processed at the next station. Each station is equipped with the necessary tools and is suf\ufb01ciently versatile to perform the variety of tasks needed to produce any model that moves through it. Many consumer products are assembled on mixed model lines when the level of product variety is soft. Prime examples are automobiles and major appliances, which are characterized by variations in models and options. \r\r\rManual Assembly Lines \rThe manual assembly line was an important development in integrated manufacturing systems. It is of global importance today in the manufacture of assembled products including automobiles and trucks, consumer electronic products, appliances, power tools, and other products made in large quantities. \rA manual assembly line consists of multiple workstations arranged sequentially, \rat which assembly operations are performed by human workers, as in Figure 38.3.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7531, "end_char_idx": 12365, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8bed75e8-4471-40d2-acab-6667363e5ebf": {"__data__": {"id_": "8bed75e8-4471-40d2-acab-6667363e5ebf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec38.txt", "file_name": "sec38.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 65929, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b25aa701-d73e-40b0-944e-ed081483a5e1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec38.txt", "file_name": "sec38.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 65929, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "7268decb502ed9c456f1228d71db902c602827b4f92af6ec3cefb23cbef2a225", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "68d2bdb6-643f-4730-b457-b9a1f71ebdd5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec38.txt", "file_name": "sec38.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 65929, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "e3767c881a032cc753ed39c2d48782c4133bfb9d3dc1b3bdc0f4edf144f061a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a3014f4f-8ebf-408a-9425-36f434d3c8e2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8f06df73c9297d6121892f48c41a96139abf0c227fcfcde3ecef990b8630b8db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "While a particular model is being worked on at one station, a different model is being processed at the next station.

It is of global importance today in the manufacture of assembled products including automobiles and trucks, consumer electronic products, appliances, power tools, and other products made in large quantities. \rA manual assembly line consists of multiple workstations arranged sequentially, \rat which assembly operations are performed by human workers, as in Figure 38.3. \rThe usual procedure on a manual line begins with \u201claunching\u201d a base part onto the \rFIGURE 38.3 A portionof a manual assembly line. Eachworker performs a taskat his or her workstation. A conveyor movesparts on work carriersfrom one station to the next. \r\rfront end of the line. A work carrier is often required to hold the part during its movement along the line. The base part travels through each of the stations where workers perform tasks that progressively build the product. Components are added to the base part at each station, so that all tasks have been completed when the product exits the \ufb01nal station. Processes accomplished on manual assembly lines include mechanical fastening operations (Chapter 31), spot welding (Section 29.2), hand soldering (Section 30.2), and adhesive joining (Section 30.3). \r38.3.1 CYCLE TIME ANALYSIS \rEquations can be developed to determine the required number of workers and workstations on a manual assembly line to meet a given annual demand. Suppose the problem is to design a single model line to satisfy annual demand for a certain product. Management must decide how many shifts per week the line will operate and the number of hours per shift. If it is assumed that the plant operates 50 weeks per year, then the required hourly production rate of the line will be given by \rDa\rRp ! (38.1)50SwHsh \rwhere Rp ! the actual average production rate, units/hr; Da ! annual demand for the product, units/year; Sw ! number of shifts/wk; and Hsh ! hours/shift. If the line operates 52 weeks rather than 50, then Rp ! Da/52SwHsh.The corresponding average production time per unit is the reciprocal of Rp \r60\rTp ! (38.2)\rRp \rwhere Tp  actual average production time, converted to minutes. \rUnfortunately, the line may not be able to operate for the entire time given by 50 SwHsh, because of lost time due to reliability problems. These reliability problems include mechanical and electrical failures, tools wearing out, power outages, and similar malfunctions. Accordingly, the line must operate at a faster time than Tp to compensate for these problems. If E ! line ef\ufb01ciency, which is the proportion of uptime on the line, then the cycle time of the line Tc is given by \r60E\rTc ! ETp ! (38.3)\rRp \rAny product contains a certain work content that represents all of the tasks that are to be accomplished on the line.

This is the problem of assigning tasks to individual workers so that all workers have an equal amount of work. Recall that the entirety of work to be accomplished on the line is given by the work content. This total work content can be divided into minimum rational work elements, each element concerned with adding a component or joining them or performing some other small portion of the total work content. The notion of a minimum rational work element is that it is the smallest practical amount of work into which the total job can be divided. Different work elements require different times, and when they are grouped into logical tasks and assigned to workers, the task times will not be equal. Thus, simply due to the variable nature of element times, some workers will end up with more work, whereas other workers will have less.The cycle time of the assembly line is determined by the station with the longest task time. \rOne might think that although the work element times are different, it should be possible to \ufb01nd groups of elements whose sums (task times) are nearly equal, if not perfectly equal. What makes it dif\ufb01cult to \ufb01nd suitable groups is that there are several constraints on this combinatorial problem. First, the line must be designed to achieve some desired production rate, which establishes the cycle time Tc at which the line must operate, as provided by Equation (38.3). Therefore, the sum of the work element times assigned to each station must be less than or equal to Tc. \rSecond, there are restrictions on the order in which the work elements can be performed. Some elements must be done before others. For example, a hole must be drilled before it can be tapped. A screw that will use the tapped hole to attach a mating component cannot be fastened before the hole has been drilled and tapped. These kinds of requirements on the work sequence are called precedence constraints. They complicate the line balancing problem. A certain element that might be allocated to a worker to obtain a task time ! Tc cannot be added because it violates a precedence constraint. \rThese and other limitations make it virtually impossible to achieve perfect balancing of the line, which means that some workers will require more time to complete their tasks than others. Methods of solving the line balancing problem, that is, allocating work elements to stations, are discussed in other references\u2014excellent references indeed, such as [10]. The inability to achieve perfect balancing results in some idle time at most stations. Because of this idle time, the actual number of workers required on the line will be greater than the number of workstations given by Equation (38.4). \rA measure of the total idle time on a manual assembly line is given by the balancing ef\ufb01 ciency Eb, de\ufb01ned as the total work content time divided by the total available service time on the line. The total work content time is equal to the sum of the times of all work elements that are to be accomplished on the line.

Call it the repositioning time Tr. It is the time required in each cycle to reposition the worker, or the work unit, or both. On a continuous transfer line where work units are attached to the line and move at a constant speed, Tr is the time taken by the worker to walk from the unit just completed to the next unit coming into the station. In all manual assembly lines, there will be some lost time due to repositioning. Assume Tr is the same for all workers, although in fact repositioning may require different times at different stations. Then Ts, Tc, and Tr are related as follows: \rTc !

For example, two workers in a station might perform assembly tasks on opposite sides of the vehicle. The number of workers in a given station is called the station manning level Mi. Averaging the manning levels over the entire line, \rw\rM ! (38.8)\rn \rwhere M ! average manning level for the assembly line; w ! number of workers on the line; and n ! number of stations. Naturally, w and n must be integers. Multiple manning conserves valuable \ufb02oor space in the factory because it reduces the number of stations required. \rAnother factor that affects manning level on an assembly line is the number of automated stations on the line, including stations that employ industrial robots (Section 38.4). Automation reduces the required labor force on the line, although it increases the need for technically trained personnel to service and maintain the automated stations. The automobile industry makes extensive use of robotic workstations to perform spot welding and spray painting on sheet-metal car bodies. The robots accomplish these operations with greater repeatability than human workers can, which translates into higher product quality. \r\r\r\r\rAutomated Production Lines \rManual assembly lines generally use a mechanized transfer system to move parts between workstations, but the stations themselves are operated by human workers. An automated production line consists of automated workstations connected by a parts transfer system that is coordinated with the stations. In the ideal, no human workers are on the line, except to perform auxiliary functions such as tool changing, loading and unloading parts at the beginning and end of the line, and repair and maintenance activities. Modern automated lines are highly integrated systems, operating under computer control. \rOperations performed by automated stations tend to be simpler than those performed by humans on manual lines. The reason is that simpler tasks are easier to automate. Operations that are dif\ufb01cult to automate are those requiring multiple steps, judgment, or human sensory capability. Tasks that are easy to automate consist of single work elements, quick actuating motions, and straight-line feed motions as in machining. \r38.4.1 TYPES OF AUTOMATED LINES \rAutomated production lines can be divided into two basic categories: (1) those that perform processing operations such as machining, and (2) those that perform assembly operations.

An important type in the processing category is the transfer line. \rTransfer Lines and Similar Processing Systems A transfer line consists of a sequence of workstations that perform production operations, with automatic transfer of work units between stations. Machining is the most common processing operation, as depicted in Figure 38.4. Automatic transfer systems for sheet metalworking and assembly are also available. In the case of machining, the workpiece typically starts as a metal casting or forging, and a series of machining operations are performed to accomplish the high-precision details (e.g., holes, threads, and \ufb01nished \ufb02at surfaces). \rTransfer lines are usually expensive pieces of equipment, sometimes costing millions of dollars; they are designed for high part quantities. The amount of machining accomplished on the work part is often signi\ufb01cant, but since the work is divided among many stations, production rates are high and unit costs are low compared to alternative production methods. Synchronous transfer of work units between stations is commonly used on automated machining lines. \r\rFIGURE 38.4 \rA machining transferline, an important typeof automated production line. \r\rFIGURE 38.5 \rCon\ufb01guration of a dial-indexing machine. \rIn-line transfer \rA variation of the automated transfer line is the dial indexing machine, Figure 38.5, in which workstations are arranged around a circular worktable, called a dial. The worktable is actuated by a mechanism that provides partial rotation of the table on each work cycle. The number of rotational positions is designed to match the number of workstations around the periphery of the table.Although the con\ufb01guration of a dial-indexing machine is quite different from a transfer line, its operation and application are quite similar. \rAutomated Assembly Systems Automated assembly systems consist of one or more workstations that perform assembly operations, such as adding components and/or af\ufb01xing them to the work unit. Automated assembly systems can be divided into single station cells and multiple station systems. Single station assembly cells are often organized around an industrial robot that has been programmed to perform a sequence of assembly steps. The robot cannot work as fast as a series of specialized automatic stations, so single station cells are used for jobs in the medium production range. \rMultiple station assembly systems are appropriate for high production. They are widely used for mass production of small products such as ball-point pens, cigarette lighters, \ufb02ashlights, and similar items consisting of a limited number of components. The number of components and assembly steps is limited because system reliability decreases rapidly with increasing complexity. \rMultiple station assembly systems are available in several con\ufb01gurations, pictured in Figure 38.6:(a) in-line,(b) rotary,and (c) carousel.The in-line con\ufb01guration is the conventional transfer line adapted to perform assembly work.These systems are not as massive as their machining counterparts.

The total work content must be allocated to individual workstations. However, since the tasks assigned to automated stations are generally simpler, and the line often contains fewer stations, the problem of de\ufb01ning what work should be done at each station is not as dif\ufb01cult for an automated line as for a manual line. \rA more signi\ufb01cant problem in automated lines is reliability. The line consists of multiple stations, interconnected by a work transfer system. It operates as an integrated system, and when one station malfunctions, the entire system is adversely affected. To analyze the operation of an automated production line, assume a system that performs processing operations and uses synchronous transfer. This model includes transfer lines as well as dial indexing machines. It does not include automated assembly systems, which require an adaptation of the model [10]. The terminology will borrow symbols from the \ufb01rst two sections: n  number of workstations on the line; Tc ! ideal cycle time on the line; Tr ! repositioning time, called the transfer time in a transfer line; and Tsi ! the service time at station i. The ideal cycle time Tc is the service time (processing time) for the slowest station on the line plus the transfer time; that is, \rTc ! Tr  Max {Tsi} (38.9) \rIn the operation of a transfer line, periodic breakdowns cause downtime on the entire line. Let F ! frequency with which breakdowns occur, causing a line stoppage; and Td ! average time the line is down when a breakdown occurs. The downtime includes the time for the repair crew to swing into action, diagnose the cause of the failure, \ufb01x it, and restart the line. \rBased on these de\ufb01nitions, the following expression can be formulated for the actual average production time Tp: \rTp ! Tc # FTd (38.10) \rwhere F  downtime frequency, line stops/cycle; and Td  downtime in minutes per line stop. Thus, FTd ! average downtime per cycle. The actual average production rate Rp ! 60/Tp, as previously given in Equation (38.2). It is of interest to compare this rate with the ideal production rate given by \r60\rRc ! (38.11)\rTc \rwhere Rp and Rc are expressed in pc/hour, given that Tp and Tc are expressed in minutes. \rUsing these de\ufb01nitions, the line ef\ufb01 ciency E for a transfer line can be de\ufb01ned. In the context of automated manufacturing systems, E refers to the proportion of uptime on the line and is really a measure of availability (Section 1.5.2) rather than ef\ufb01 ciency: \rTc\rE ! (38.12)\rTc # FTd \rThis is the same relationship as earlier Equation (38.3), since Tp ! Tc # FTd. It should be noted that the same de\ufb01nition of line ef\ufb01ciency applies to manual assembly lines, except that technological breakdowns are not as much of a problem on manual lines (human workers are more reliable than electromechanical equipment, at least in the sense discussed here). \rLine downtime is usually associated with failures at individual workstations. Reasons for downtime include scheduled and unscheduled tool changes, mechanical and electrical malfunctions, hydraulic failures, and normal equipment wear.

Parts (and products) in this quantity range are traditionally made in batches, and batch production requires downtime for setup changeovers and has high inventory carrying costs. Cellular manufacturing is based on an approach called group technology (GT), which minimizes the disadvantages of batch production by recognizing that although the parts are different, they also possess similarities. When these similarities are exploited in production, operating ef\ufb01ciencies are improved. The improvement is typically achieved by organizing the production around manufacturing cells. Each cell is designed to produce one part family (or a limited number of part families), thereby following the principle of specialization of operations.The cell includes special production equipment and custom-designed tools and \ufb01xtures, so that the production of the part families can be optimized.

Figure 38.8 shows several parts with geometries that differ, but their manufacturing requirements are quite similar. \rFIGURE 38.7 Two parts that are identicalin shape and size butquite different inmanufacturing:(a) 1,000,000 units/yr, tolerance 0.010 in., 1015 CR steel, nickel plate; and (b) 100/yr, tolerance 0.001 in, 18-8 stainless steel. \rFIGURE 38.8 Ten parts that are differentin size and shape, butquite similar in termsof manufacturing. Allparts are machinedfrom cylindrical stockby turning; some partsrequire drilling and/ormilling. \r\rThere are several ways by which part families are identi\ufb01ed in industry. One method involves visual inspection of all the parts made in the factory (or photos of the parts) and using best judgment to group them into appropriate families.Another approach, called production \ufb02 ow analysis, uses information contained on route sheets (Section 39.1.1) to classify parts. In effect, parts with similar manufacturing steps are grouped into the same family. \rA third method, usually the most expensive but most useful, is parts classi\ufb01cation and coding. Parts classi\ufb01cation and coding involve the identi\ufb01cation of similarities and differences among parts and relating these parts by means of a numerical coding scheme. Most classi\ufb01cation and coding systems are one of the following: (1) systems based on part design attributes, (2) systems based on part manufacturing attributes, and (3) systems based on both design and manufacturing attributes. Common part design and manufacturing attributes used in GT systems are presented in Table 38.3. Because each company produces a unique set of parts and products, a classi\ufb01cation and coding system that may be satisfactory for one company is not necessarily appropriate for another company. Each company must design its own coding \r\rTABLE \u2022 38.3 Design and manufacturing attributes typically included in a parts classi\ufb01cation and coding system. \r\rscheme. Parts classi\ufb01cation and coding systems are described more thoroughly in several of the references [8], [10], [11]. \rBene\ufb01ts often cited for a well-designed classi\ufb01cation and coding system include that it (1) facilitates formation of part families, (2) permits quick retrieval of part design drawings, (3) reduces design duplication because similar or identical part designs can be retrieved and reused rather than designed from scratch, (4) promotes design standardization, (5) improves cost estimating and cost accounting, (6) facilitates numerical control (NC) part programming by allowing new parts to use the same basic part program as existing parts in the same family, (7) allows sharing of tools and \ufb01xtures, and (8) aids computer-aided process planning (CAPP) (Section \r39.1.3) because standard process plans can be correlated to part family code numbers, so that existing process plans can be reused or edited for new parts in the same family. \r\r38.5.2 MACHINE CELLS \rTo fully exploit the similarities among parts in a family, production should be organized using machine cells designed to specialize in making those particular parts.

One of the principles in designing a group technology machine cell is the composite part concept. \rComposite Part Concept Members of a part family possess similar design and/ or manufacturing features. There is usually a correlation between part design features and the manufacturing operations that produce those features. Round holes are made by drilling; cylindrical shapes are made by turning; and so on. \rThe composite part for a given family (not to be confused with a part made of composite material) is a hypothetical part that includes all of the design and manufacturing attributes of the family. In general, an individual part in the family will have some of the features that characterize the family, but not all of them. A production cell designed for the part family would include those machines required to make the composite part. Such a cell would be capable of producing any member of the family, simply by omitting those operations corresponding to features not possessed by the particular part.The cell would also be designed to allow for size variations within the family as well as feature variations. \rTo illustrate, consider the composite part in Figure 38.9(a). It represents a family of rotational parts with features de\ufb01ned in part (b) of the \ufb01gure. Associated \r\rFIGURE 38.9 Composite part concept: (a) the composite part for a family of machined rotational parts, and (b) theindividual features of the composite part. \rwith each feature is a certain machining operation, as summarized in Table 38.4. A machine cell to produce this part family would be designed with the capability to accomplish all of the operations in the last column of the table. \rMachine Cell Designs Machine cells can be classi\ufb01ed according to number of machines and level of automation. The possibilities are (a) single machine, (b) multiple machines with manual handling, (c) multiple machines with mechanized handling, (d) \ufb02exible manufacturing cell, or (e) \ufb02exible manufacturing system. These production cells are depicted in Figure 38.10. \rThe single machine cell has one machine that is manually operated. The cell would also include \ufb01xtures and tools to allow for feature and size variations within the part family produced by the cell.The machine cell required for the part family of Figure 38.9 would probably be of this type. \rMultiple machine cells have two or more manually operated machines. These cells are distinguished by the method of work part handling in the cell, manual or mechanized. Manual handling means that parts are moved within the cell by workers, usually the machine operators. Mechanized handling refers to conveyorized \rTABLE \u2022 38.4 Design features of the composite part in Figure 38.3 and the manufacturing operations required to shape those features. \r\r\rFIGURE 38.10 \rTypes of group technology machinecells: (a) singlemachine, (b) multiplemachines with manual handling, (c) multiplemachines with mechanized handling,\r(d)\r \ufb02exible manufacturing cell, and\r\r(e)\r \ufb02exible manufacturing system.Key: Man  manual operation; Aut ! automated station. \r\r\rtransfer of parts from one machine to the next.

One obvious problem is rearranging production machines in the plant into the appropriate machine cells. It takes time to plan and accomplish this rearrangement, and the machines are not producing during the changeover. The biggest problem in starting a GT program is identifying the part families. If the plant makes 10,000 different parts, reviewing all of the part drawings and grouping the parts into families are substantial tasks that consume a signi\ufb01cant amount of time. \r\r\r\rFlexible Manufacturing Systems and Cells \rA \ufb02exible manufacturing system (FMS) is a highly automated group technology machine cell, consisting of a multiple processing stations (usually computer numerical control machine tools), interconnected by an automated material handling and storage system, and controlled by an integrated computer system. An FMS is capable of processing a variety of different part styles simultaneously under NC program control at the different workstations. \rAn FMS relies on the principles of group technology. No manufacturing system can be completely \ufb02exible. It cannot produce an in\ufb01nite range of parts or products. There are limits to how much \ufb02exibility can be incorporated into an FMS. Accordingly, a \ufb02exible manufacturing system is designed to produce parts (or products) within a range of styles, sizes, and processes. In other words, an FMS is capable of producing a single part family or a limited range of part families. \rFlexible manufacturing systems vary in terms of number of machine tools and level of \ufb02exibility.When the system has only a few machines,the term \ufb02 exible manufacturing cell (FMC) is sometimes used. Both cell and system are highly automated and computer controlled.The difference between an FMS and an FMC is not always clear, but it is sometimes based on the number of machines (workstations) included. The \ufb02 exible manufacturing system consists of four or more machines, whereas a \ufb02exible manufacturing cell consists of three or fewer machines [10]. \rTo qualify as being \ufb02 exible, a manufacturing system should satisfy several criteria. The tests of \ufb02exibility in an automated manufacturing system are the capability to (1) process different part styles in a nonbatch mode, (2) accept changes in production schedule, (3) respond gracefully to equipment malfunctions and breakdowns in the system,and (4) accommodate the introduction of new part designs.These capabilities are made possible by the use of a central computer that controls and coordinates the components of the system. The most important criteria are (1) and (2). Criteria (3) and (4) are less critical and can be implemented at various levels of sophistication. \r38.6.1 INTEGRATING THE FMS COMPONENTS \rAn FMS consists of hardware and software that must be integrated into an ef\ufb01 cient and reliable unit.It also includes human personnel.This section examines these components and how they are integrated. \rHardware Components FMS hardware includes workstations, material handling system, and central control computer. The workstations are CNC machines in a machining type system, plus inspection stations, parts cleaning and other stations, as required. A central chip conveyor system is often installed below \ufb02oor level. \rThe material handling system is the means by which parts are moved between stations. The material handling system usually includes a limited capability to store parts. Handling systems suitable for automated manufacturing include roller conveyors, automated guided vehicles, and industrial robots.

The material handling system usually includes a limited capability to store parts. Handling systems suitable for automated manufacturing include roller conveyors, automated guided vehicles, and industrial robots. The most appropriate type depends on part size and geometry, as well as factors relating to economics and compatibility with other FMS components. Nonrotational parts are often moved in a FMS on pallet \ufb01xtures, so the pallets are designed for the particular handling system, and the \ufb01xtures are designed to accommodate the various part geometries in the family. Rotational parts are often handled by robots, if weight is not a limiting factor. \rThe handling system establishes the basic layout of the FMS. Five layout types can be distinguished: (1) in-line, (2) loop, (3) ladder, (4) open \ufb01eld, and (5) robot-centered cell.Types 1,3,4,and 5 are shown in Figure 38.11.Type 2 is shown in Figure 38.10(e). The in-line layout uses a linear transfer system to move parts between processing stations and load/unload station(s). The in-line transfer system is usually capable of two-directional movement; if not, then the FMS operates much like a transfer line, and the different part styles made on the system must follow the same basic processing sequence due to the one-direction \ufb02ow. The loop layout consists of a conveyor loop with workstations located around its periphery. This con\ufb01guration permits any processing sequence, because any station is accessible from any other station. This is also true for the ladder layout, in which workstations are located on the rungs of the ladder. The open \ufb01 eld layout is the most complex FMS con\ufb01guration, and consists of several loops tied together. Finally, the robot-centered cell consists of a robot whose work volume includes the load/unload positions of the machines in the cell. \rThe FMS also includes a central computer that is interfaced to the other hardware components. In addition to the central computer, the individual machines and other components generally have microcomputers as their individual control units. The function of the central computer is to coordinate the activities of the components so as to achieve a smooth overall operation of the system. It accomplishes this function by means of software. \rFMS Software and Control Functions FMS software consists of modules associated with the various functions performed by the manufacturing system. For example, one function involves downloading NC part programs to the individual machine tools; another function is concerned with controlling the material handling system; another is concerned with tool management; and so on. Table 38.5 lists the functions included in the operation of a typical FMS. Associated with each function are one or more software modules. The functions and modules are largely application speci\ufb01 c. \rHuman Labor An additional component in the operation of a \ufb02exible manufacturing system or cell is human labor. Duties performed by human workers include \r(1) loading and unloading parts from the system, (2) changing and setting cutting tools, (3) maintenance and repair of equipment, (4) NC part programming, (5) programming and operating the computer system, and (6) overall management of the system. \r\r38.6.2 APPLICATIONS OF FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS \rFlexible manufacturing systems are typically used for mid-volume, mid-variety production.

Owing to the inherent \ufb02exibilities and capabilities of computer numerical control, it is possible to connect several CNC machine tools to a small central computer, and to devise automated material handling methods for transferring parts between machines. Figure 38.13 shows a \ufb02exible machining system consisting of \ufb01ve CNC machining centers and an in-line transfer system to pick up parts from a central load/unload station and move them to the appropriate machining stations. \rFIGURE 38.12 \rApplicationcharacteristics of \ufb02exible manufacturing systems and cellsrelative to other typesof manufacturing systems. \r\rFIGURE 38.13 \rA \ufb01ve-station \ufb02exible manufacturing system.(Photo courtesy ofCincinnati Milacron.) \r\rIn addition to machining systems, other types of \ufb02exible manufacturing systems have also been developed, although the state of technology in these other processes has not permitted the rapid implementation that has occurred in machining. The other types of systems include assembly, inspection, sheet-metal processing (punching, shearing, bending, and forming), and forging. \rMost of the experience in \ufb02exible manufacturing systems has been gained in machining applications. For \ufb02exible machining systems, the bene\ufb01ts usually given are (1) higher machine utilization than a conventional machine shop (relative utilizations are 40% to 50% for conventional batch type operations compared with about 75% for a FMS because of better work handling, of\ufb02ine setups, and improved scheduling); (2) reduced work-in-process due to continuous production rather than batch production; (3) lower manufacturing lead times; and (4) greater \ufb02exibility in production scheduling. \r\r38.6.3 MASS CUSTOMIZATION \rTaken to its limit, \ufb02exible manufacturing is capable of producing a unique product for each customer.This capability is called mass customization,in which a large variety of products are made at ef\ufb01ciencies approaching those of mass production. Each product is individually customized according to speci\ufb01cations of individual customers. Referring back to the de\ufb01nitions of production quantity and product variety in Section 1.1.2, the distinction between mass production and mass customization is indicated in Table 38.6. In the extreme, mass production is the production of very \rTABLE \u2022 38.6 Comparison between mass production and mass customization. \r\r\rlarge quantities of one product style. Similarly, mass customization involves large product variety and only one unit is produced of each product style. \rThe challenge for the mass customizer is to manage its design and production operations without the waste associated with needless product proliferation, in which the company offers its customers so many choices among products and available options that it is unpro\ufb01table. The following example illustrates product proliferation at its worst. \rA few decades ago, one of the truck manufacturers in the United States offered its customers a wide variety of model choices and options. Any of more than 100 truck models could be ordered, and each model was available in 7 different wheel bases.

Thus, the company offered its customers a choice among \r100(7)(42)(43)(62)(162)  130(108) possible combinations. \rAt its peak, the company had an annual production of 130,000 trucks. If each customer were to order a different truck, the company could produce trucks for \r130(108)  10,000 years without ever producing the same truck twice. \r130,000 \rThe negative consequences of product proliferation include (1) large raw material, work-in-process, and \ufb01nished product inventories; (2) high purchasing costs; (3) large \ufb02oor space requirements, (4) too many setups and too much tooling, (5) a costly overhead to manage the variety, (6) much marketing literature and design data; and (7) customer confusion. So the question is: How can a company offer customized product variety while at the same time avoiding the negative consequences of product proliferation? \rThe successful mass customizer can use a number of strategies to operate ef\ufb01 ciently in the face of a large product variety. They include: (1) soft product variety, \r(2) design modularity, (3) postponement, and (4) designing the product to be easily customized. \rLarge product variety does not mean hard product variety, recalling the terminology of Section 1.1.2. Indeed, mass customization would not be feasible unless soft product variety were practiced by the company that offered customized products to its customers. Soft product variety means that there are only small differences among available products. The differences may appear signi\ufb01cant to the customer, but to the company, they are easily managed in production. The company\u2019s strategy is to minimize the real differences among its products while enticing the customer to appreciate the product differentiation; for example, offering a product in which all internal components are identical but the product is available in a variety of external colors. \rModularity in product design is another approach used by mass customizers, in which the product consists of standard modules that can be assembled in unique combinations to satisfy individual customers\u2019 speci\ufb01cations. The modules are standard building blocks that are perhaps mass produced, but they combine in different ways to achieve a singular product. Of course, the modules must be designed in such a way that facilitates their assembly. An example is the personal computer. Each PC customer speci\ufb01es from a variety of features and options, all of which relate to hardware and software modules that are assembled and loaded to meet the speci\ufb01 cations. \rPostponement is closely related to design modularity. It means that the mass customizer waits until the last possible moment to complete the product which occurs after a customer order has been received. The alternative is carrying a large inventory of \ufb01nished products that match all of the possible combinations of speci\ufb01cations that customers might want. \rFinally, the mass customizer designs the product so that it can be readily customized. The customization can be accomplished at the last moment by the manufacturer, as in postponement, or it can be accomplished by the merchant who deals directly with the customer. An example of customization by the manufacturer is when the customer can select among alternative design parameters and options that are available, and the product is then made to those speci\ufb01 cations. Automobiles are sometimes purchased this way.An example of merchant customization is when paint dealers mix colorants with a standard neutral base paint to achieve the exact color desired by the customer. The mass customizer may also design adjustability into the product, so that the customers themselves can individualize the product.

Even though some of the operations are manually accomplished (e.g., manual assembly lines and manned cells), computer systems are utilized for production scheduling, data collection, record keeping, performance tracking, and other information-related functions. In the more automated systems (e.g., transfer lines and \ufb02exible manufacturing cells), computers directly control the operations. The term computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) refers to the pervasive use of computer systems throughout the organization, not only to monitor and control the operations, but also to design the product, plan the manufacturing processes, and accomplish the business functions related to production. One might say that CIM is the ultimate integrated manufacturing system. In this \ufb01nal section of Part X, the scope of CIM is outlined, and a bridge is provided to Part XI on manufacturing support systems. \rTo begin, there are four general functions that have to be accomplished in most manufacturing enterprises: (1) product design, (2) manufacturing planning, (3) manufacturing control, and (4) business functions. Product design is usually an iterative process that includes recognition of a need for a product, problem de\ufb01 nition, creative \rCIM \r\rCustomer feedback to design \rFIGURE 38.14 Four general functions in a manufacturing organization, and how computer integrated manufacturingsystems support these functions. \rsynthesis of a solution, analysis and optimization, evaluation, and documentation. The overall quality of the resulting design is likely to be the most important factor upon which the commercial success of a product depends. In addition, a very signi\ufb01 cant portion of the \ufb01nal cost of the product is determined by decisions made during product design. Manufacturing planning is concerned with converting the engineering drawings and speci\ufb01cations that de\ufb01ne the product design into a plan for producing the product. Manufacturing planning includes decisions on which parts will be purchased (the \u201cmake-or-buy decision\u201d), how each \u201cmake\u201d part will be produced, the equipment that will be used, how the work will be scheduled, and so on. Most of these decisions are discussed in Chapter 39 on process planning and production control. Manufacturing control includes not only control of the individual processes and equipment in the plant, but also the supporting functions such as shop \ufb02 oor control (Section 39.3.4) and quality control (Chapter 40). Finally, the business functions include order entry, cost accounting, payroll, customer billing, and other business-oriented information activities related to manufacturing. \rComputer systems play an important role in these four general functions, and their integration within the organization is a distinguishing feature of computer integrated manufacturing, as depicted in Figure 38.14. Computer systems associated with product design are called CAD systems (for computer-aided design). Design systems and software include geometric modeling, engineering analysis packages such as \ufb01nite element modeling, design review and evaluation, and automated drafting. Computer systems that support manufacturing planning are called CAM systems (for computer-aided manufacturing) and include computer-aided process planning (CAPP, Section 39.1.3), NC part programming (Section 38.3.3), production scheduling (Section 39.3.1), and planning packages such as material requirements planning (Section 39.3.2). Manufacturing control systems include those used in process control, shop \ufb02oor control, inventory control, and computer-aided inspection for quality control. And computerized business systems are used for order entry, customer billing, and other business functions. Customer orders are entered by the company\u2019s sales force or by the customers themselves into the computerized order entry system.

The design details serve as inputs to the manufacturing engineering group, where computer-aided process planning, computer-aided tool design, and related activities are performed in advance of actual production. The output from manufacturing engineering provides much of the input data required for manufacturing resource planning and production scheduling. Thus, computer integrated manufacturing provides the information \ufb02ows required to accomplish the actual production of the product. \rToday, computer integrated manufacturing is implemented in many companies using enterprise resource planning (ERP), a computer software system that organizes and integrates the information \ufb02ows in an organization through a single, central database.

The position of the manufacturing support systems in the overall operations of the company is portrayed in Figure 39.1. Like the manufacturing systems in the factory, the manufacturing support systems include people. People make the systems work. Unlike the manufacturing systems in the factory, most of the support systems do not directly contact the product during its processing and assembly. Instead, they plan and control the activities in the factory to ensure that the products are completed and delivered to the customer on time, in the right quantities, and to the highest quality standards. \rThe quality control system is one of the manufacturing support systems, but it also consists of facilities located in the factory\u2014inspection equipment used to measure and gage the materials being processed and products being assembled. The quality control system is covered in Chapter 40. Many of the traditional measurement and gaging techniques used in inspection are described in Chapter 5. Other manufacturing support \r\r1028 \r\rsystems include process planning, production planning and control, just-in-time, and lean production, covered in the present chapter. \rProcess planning is a technical staff function that plans the sequence of manufacturing processes for the economic production of high-quality products. Its purpose is to engineer the transition from design speci\ufb01 cation to physical product. Process planning includes (a) deciding what processes and methods should be used and in what sequence, (b) determining tooling requirements, (c) selecting production equipment and systems, and (d) estimating costs of production for the selected processes, tooling, and equipment. \rProcess planning is usually the principal function within the manufacturing engineering department, whose overall goal is to optimize the production operations in a given organization. In addition to process planning, the scope of manufacturing engineering usually includes other functions such as the following: \r\u27a2 \rProblem solving and continuous improvement. Manufacturing engineering provides staff support to the operating departments (parts fabrication and product assembly) to solve technical production problems. It should also be engaged in continuous efforts to reduce production costs, increase productivity, and improve product quality. \r\r\u27a2 \rDesign for manufacturability. In this function, which chronologically precedes the other two, manufacturing engineers serve as manufacturability advisors to product designers. The objective is to develop product designs that not only meet functional and performance requirements, but that also can be produced at reasonable cost with minimum technical problems at highest possible quality in the shortest possible time. \r\r\rManufacturing engineering must be performed in any industrial organization that is engaged in production. The manufacturing engineering department usually reports to the manager of manufacturing in a company. In some companies the department is known by other names, such as process engineering or production engineering. Often included under manufacturing engineering are tool design, tool fabrication, and various technical support groups. \r\r\rProcess Planning \rProcess planning involves determining the most appropriate manufacturing processes and the sequence in which they should be performed to produce a given part or product speci\ufb01ed by design engineering. If it is an assembled product, process planning includes deciding the appropriate sequence of assembly steps. The process plan must be developed within the limitations imposed by available processing equipment and productive capacity of the factory.

If it is an assembled product, process planning includes deciding the appropriate sequence of assembly steps. The process plan must be developed within the limitations imposed by available processing equipment and productive capacity of the factory. Parts or subassemblies that cannot be made internally must be purchased from external suppliers. In some cases, items that can be produced internally may be purchased from outside vendors for economic or other reasons. \r39.1.1 TRADITIONAL PROCESS PLANNING \rTraditionally, process planning has been accomplished by manufacturing engineers who are knowledgeable in the particular processes used in the factory and are able to read engineering drawings. Based on their knowledge, skill, and experience, they develop the processing steps in the most logical sequence required to make each part.Table 39.1 lists the many details and decisions usually included within the scope of process planning. Some of these details are often delegated to specialists, such as tool designers; but manufacturing engineering is responsible for them. \rProcess Planning for Parts The processes needed to manufacture a given part are determined largely by the material out of which it is to be made. The material is selected by the product designer based on functional requirements. Once the material has been selected, the choice of possible processes is narrowed considerably. \rA typical processing sequence to fabricate a discrete part consists of (1) a basic process, (2) one or more secondary processes, (3) operations to enhance physical properties, and (4) \ufb01nishing operations, as illustrated in Figure 39.2. Basic and secondary processes are shaping processes that alter the geometry of a work part (Section 1.3.1). A basic process establishes the initial geometry of the part. Examples \rTABLE \u2022 39.1 Decisions and details required in process planning. \r\r\rFIGURE 39.2 Typical sequence of processes required in part fabrication. \rinclude metal casting, forging, and sheet-metal rolling. In most cases, the starting geometry must be re\ufb01ned by a series of secondary processes.These operations transform the basic shape into the \ufb01nal geometry. There is a correlation between the secondary processes that might be used and the basic process that provides the initial form. For example, when a rolling mill produces strips or coils of sheet metal, the secondary processes are stamping operations such as blanking, punching, and bend-ing.When casting or forging are the basic processes,machining operations are generally the secondary processes. Figure 39.3 shows a plumbing \ufb01xture, the production of which consists of casting as the basic process followed by machining as the secondary process. Selection of certain basic processes minimizes the need for secondary processes. For example, if plastic injection molding is the basic process, secondary operations are usually not required because molding is capable of providing the detailed geometric features with good dimensional accuracy. \rShaping operations are generally followed by operations to enhance physical properties and/or \ufb01nish the product. Operations to enhance properties include heat treating operations on metal components and glassware. In many cases, parts do not \r\rFIGURE 39.3 This plumbing \ufb01xture illustrates the basic and secondary processes.Casting (basic process)provides the startinggeometry on the left,followed by a series ofmachining operations(secondary process)that accurately shapethe holes and threads for the \ufb01nished part on the right.

This is indicated by the alternate arrow path in our \ufb01gure. Finishing operations are the \ufb01nal operations in the sequence; they usually provide a coating on the work part (or assembly) surface. Examples of these processes are electroplating and painting. \rIn some cases, property-enhancing processes are followed by additional secondary operations before proceeding to \ufb01 nishing, as suggested by the return loop in Figure 39.2. An example is a machined part that is hardened by heat treatment. Prior to heat treatment, the part is left slightly oversized to allow for distortion. After hardening, it is reduced to \ufb01nal size and tolerance by \ufb01 nish grinding. Another example, again in metal parts fabrication, is when annealing is used to restore ductility to the metal after cold working to permit further deformation of the workpiece. \rTable 39.2 presents some of the typical processing sequences for various materials and basic processes.The task of the process planner usually begins after the basic process has provided the initial shape of the part. Machined parts begin as bar stock or castings or forgings, and the basic processes for these starting shapes are often external to the fabricating plant. Stampings begin as sheet metal coils or strips purchased from the mill. These are the raw materials supplied from external suppliers for the secondary processes and subsequent operations to be performed in the factory. Determining the most appropriate processes and the order in which they must be accomplished relies on the skill, experience, and judgment of the process planner. Some of the basic guidelines and considerations used by process planners to make these decisions are outlined in Table 39.3. \rThe Route Sheet The process plan is prepared on a form called a route sheet, a typical example of which is shown in Figure 39.4 (some companies use other names for this form). It is called a route sheet because it speci\ufb01es the sequence of operations and equipment that will be visited by the part during its production. The route sheet is to the process planner what the engineering drawing is to the product designer. It is the of\ufb01cial document that speci\ufb01es the details of the process plan.The route sheet should include all manufacturing operations to be performed on the work part, listed in the proper order in which they are to be accomplished. For each operation, the following should be listed: (1) a brief description of the \rTABLE \u2022 39.3 Guidelines and considerations in deciding processes and their sequence in process planning. \r\roperation indicating the work to be done, surfaces to be processed with references to the part drawing, and dimensions (and tolerances, if not speci\ufb01 ed on part drawing) to be achieved; (2) the equipment on which the work is to be performed; and \r(3) any special tooling required, such as dies, molds, cutting tools, jigs or \ufb01 xtures, and gages. In addition, some companies include cycle time standards, setup times, and other data on the route sheet. \rSometimes a more detailed operation sheet is also prepared for each operation listed in the routing. This is retained in the particular department where the operation is performed. It indicates the speci\ufb01c details of the operation, such as cutting speeds, feeds, and tools, and other instructions useful to the machine operator. Setup sketches are sometimes also included. \rProcess Planning for Assemblies For low production, assembly is generally done at individual workstations and a worker or team of workers performs the assembly work elements to complete the product. In medium and high production, assembly is usually performed on production lines (Section 37.2). In either case, there is a precedence order in which the work must be accomplished. \rProcess planning for assembly involves preparation of the assembly instructions that must be performed. For single stations, the documentation is similar to the \r\rFIGURE 39.4 Typical route sheet for specifying the processplan. \r\rprocessing route sheet in Figure 39.4. It contains a list of the assembly steps in the order in which they must be done.

In effect, the assembly line routes the work units to individual stations, and the line balancing solution determines what assembly steps must be performed at each station. As with process planning for parts, any tools and \ufb01xtures needed to accomplish a given assembly work element must be decided, and the workplace layout must be designed. \r39.1.2 MAKE OR BUY DECISION \rInevitably, the question arises as to whether a given part should be purchased from an outside vendor or made internally. First of all, it should be recognized that virtually all manufacturers purchase their starting materials from suppliers. A machine shop buys bar stock from a metals distributor and castings from a foundry. A plastic molder obtains molding compound from a chemical company. A pressworking company purchases sheet metal from a rolling mill. Very few companies are vertically integrated all the way from raw materials to \ufb01nished product. \rGiven that a company purchases at least some of its starting materials, it is reasonable to ask whether the company should purchase at least some of the parts that would otherwise be made in its own factory. The answer to the question is the make or buy decision. The make versus buy question is probably appropriate to ask for every component used by the company. \rCost is the most important factor in deciding whether a part should be made in-house or purchased. If the vendor is signi\ufb01cantly more pro\ufb01cient in the processes required to make the component, it is likely that the internal production cost will be greater than the purchase price even when a pro\ufb01t is included for the vendor. On the other hand, if purchasing the part results in idle equipment in the factory, then an apparent cost advantage for the vendor may be a disadvantage for the home factory. Consider the following example. \r\rSuppose that the quoted price for a certain component from a vendor is $8.00 per unit for 1000 units. The same part made in the home factory would cost $9.00. The cost breakdown on the make alternative is as follows: \rUnit material cost  $2.25 per unit Direct labor  $2.00 per unit Labor overhead at 150%  $3.00 per unit Equipment \ufb01xed cost  $1.75 per unit \rTotal  $9.00 per unit \rShould the component by bought or made in-house? \rSolution: Although the vendor\u2019s quote seems to favor the buy decision, consider the possible effect on the factory if the quote is accepted. The equipment \ufb01xed cost is an allocated cost based on an investment that has already been made (Section 1.5.2). If it turns out that the equipment is rendered idle by the decision to buy the part, then one might argue that the \ufb01xed cost of $1.75 continues even if the equipment is not in use. Similarly, the overhead cost of $3.00 consists of factory \ufb02oor space, indirect labor, and other costs that will also continue even if the part is bought.

In recent years, major companies have placed strong emphasis on building close relationships with parts suppliers. This trend has been especially prevalent in the automobile industry, where long-term agreements have been reached between each carmaker and a limited number of vendors who are able to deliver high-quality components reliably on schedule. \r\r39.1.3 COMPUTER-AIDED PROCESS PLANNING \rDuring the last several decades, there has been considerable interest automating the process planning function by means of computer systems. Shop people knowledgeable in manufacturing processes are gradually retiring. An alternative approach to process planning is needed, and computer-aided process planning (CAPP) systems \r\rTABLE \u2022 39.4 Key factors in the make or buy decision. \r\rprovide this alternative.CAPP systems are designed around either of two approaches: retrieval systems and generative systems. \rRetrieval CAPP Systems Retrieval CAPP systems, also known as variant CAPP systems, are based on group technology and parts classi\ufb01cation and coding (Section 38.5). In these systems, a standard process plan is stored in computer \ufb01les for each part code number. The standard plans are based on current part routings in use in the factory, or on an ideal plan that is prepared for each family. Retrieval CAPP systems operate as indicated in Figure 39.5. The user begins by identifying the GT code of the part for which the process plan is to be determined. A search is made of the part family \ufb01le to determine if a standard route sheet exists for the given part code. If the \ufb01le contains a process plan for the part, it is retrieved and displayed for the user.The standard process plan is examined to determine whether modi\ufb01cations are necessary. Although the new part has the same code number, minor differences in the processes might be required to make the part. The standard plan is edited accordingly. The capacity to alter an existing process plan is why retrieval CAPP systems are also called variant systems. \r\r\r\r\rIf the \ufb01le does not contain a standard process plan for the given code number, the user may search the \ufb01le for a similar code number for which a standard routing exists. By editing the existing process plan, or by starting from scratch, the user develops the process plan for the new part. This becomes the standard process plan for the new part code number. \rThe \ufb01nal step is the process plan formatter, which prints the route sheet in the proper format. The formatter may access other application programs; for example, to determine cutting conditions for machine tool operations, to calculate standard times for machining operations, or to compute cost estimates. \rGenerative CAPP Systems Generative CAPP systems are an alternative to retrieval systems. Rather than retrieving and editing existing plans from a database, a generative system creates the process plan using systematic procedures that might be applied by a human planner. In a fully generative CAPP system, the process sequence is planned without human assistance and without prede\ufb01ned standard plans. \rDesigning a generative CAPP system is a problem in the \ufb01eld of expert systems, a branch of arti\ufb01cial intelligence. Expert systems are computer programs capable of solving complex problems that normally require a human who has years of education and experience. Process planning \ufb01ts that de\ufb01nition. Several ingredients are required in a fully generative CAPP system: \r1. \rKnowledge base. The technical knowledge of manufacturing and the logic used by successful process planners must be captured and coded into a computer program. An expert system applied to process planning requires the knowledge and logic of human process planners to be incorporated into a knowledge base. Generative CAPP systems then use the knowledge base to solve process planning problems; that is, to create route sheets. \r\r2. \rComputer-compatible part description.

A generative CAPP system requires the capability to apply the planning logic and process knowledge contained in the knowledge base to a given part description. The CAPP system applies its knowledge base to solve a speci\ufb01c problem of planning the process for a new part. This problem-solving procedure is referred to as the inference engine in the terminology of expert systems. By using its knowledge base and inference engine, the CAPP system synthesizes a new process plan for each new part presented to it. \r\r\rBene\ufb01ts of CAPP Bene\ufb01ts of computer-automated process planning include the following: (1) process rationalization and standardization\u2014automated process planning leads to more logical and consistent process plans than when traditional process planning is used; (2) increased productivity of process planners\u2014the systematic approach and availability of standard process plans in the data \ufb01les permit a greater number of process plans to be developed by the user; (3) reduced lead time to prepare process plans; (4) improved legibility compared to manually prepared route sheets; and (5) ability to interface CAPP programs with other application programs, such as cost estimating, work standards, and others. \r\r\rOther Manufacturing Engineering Functions \rAlthough process planning is the principal function of manufacturing engineering, two additional functions are (1) problem solving and continuous improvement, and \r(2) design for manufacturing and assembly.A related topic is concurrent engineering. \r39.2.1 PROBLEM SOLVING AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT \rProblems arise in manufacturing that require technical staff support beyond what is normally available in the line organization of the production departments. Providing this technical support is one of the responsibilities of manufacturing engineering. The problems are usually speci\ufb01c to the particular technologies of the processes performed in the operating department. In machining, the problems may relate to selection of cutting tools, \ufb01xtures that do not work properly, parts with out-of-tolerance conditions, or nonoptimal cutting conditions. In plastic molding, the problems may be excessive \ufb02ash, parts sticking in the mold, or any of several defects that can occur in a molded part. These problems are technical, and engineering expertise is often required to solve them. \rIn some cases, the solution may require a design change; for example, changing the tolerance on a part dimension to eliminate a \ufb01nish grinding operation while still achieving the functionality of the part. The manufacturing engineer is responsible for developing the proper solution to the problem and proposing the engineering change to the design department. \rOne of the areas that is ripe for improvement is setup time. The procedures involved in changing over from one production setup to the next (i.e., in batch production) are time consuming and costly. Manufacturing engineers are responsible for analyzing changeover procedures and \ufb01nding ways to reduce the time required to perform them. Some of the approaches used in setup reduction are described in Section 39.4. \rIn addition to solving current technical problems (\u201c\ufb01re \ufb01ghting,\u201d as it might be called), the manufacturing engineering department is often responsible for continuous improvement projects. Continuous improvement means constantly searching for and implementing ways to reduce cost, improve quality, and increase productivity in manufacturing. It is accomplished one project at a time.

Decisions on material, part geometry, tolerances, surface \ufb01nish, grouping of parts into subassemblies, and assembly techniques limit the available manufacturing processes that can be used to make a given part. If the product engineer designs an aluminum sand casting with features that can be achieved only by machining (e.g., \ufb02at surfaces with good \ufb01nishes, close tolerances, and threaded holes), then the process planner has no choice but to plan for sand casting followed by the required machining operations. If the product designer speci\ufb01es a collection of sheet-metal stampings to be assembled by threaded fasteners, then the process planner must lay out the series of blanking, punching, and forming steps to fabricate the stampings and then assemble them. In both of these examples, a plastic molded part might be a superior design, both functionally and economically. It is important for the manufacturing engineer to act as an advisor to the design engineer in matters of manufacturability because manufacturability matters, not only to the production departments but to the design engineer. A product design that is functionally superior and at the same time can be produced at minimum cost holds the greatest promise of success in the marketplace. Successful careers in design engineering are built on successful products. \rTerms often associated with this attempt to favorably in\ufb02uence the manufacturability of a product are design for manufacturing (DFM) and design for assembly (DFA). Of course, DFM and DFA are inextricably coupled, so refer to the pair as DFM/A. Design for manufacturing and assembly is an approach to product design that systematically includes considerations of manufacturability and assemblability in the design. DFM/A includes organizational changes and design principles and guidelines. \rTo implement DFM/A, a company must change its organizational structure, either formally or informally, to provide closer interaction and better communication between design and manufacturing personnel. This is often accomplished by forming project teams consisting of product designers, manufacturing engineers, and other specialties (e.g., quality engineers, material scientists) to design the product. In some companies, design engineers are required to spend some career time in manufacturing to learn about the problems encountered in making things. Another possibility is to assign manufacturing engineers to the product design department as full-time consultants. \rDFM/A also includes principles and guidelines that indicate how to design a given product for maximum manufacturability. Many of these are universal design guidelines, such as those presented in Table 39.5. They are rules of thumb that can be applied to nearly any product design situation. In addition, several of our chapters on manufacturing processes include design guidelines that are speci\ufb01c to those processes. \rThe guidelines are sometimes in con\ufb02ict. For example, one guideline for part design is to make the geometry as simple as possible. Yet, in design for assembly, it is often desirable to combine features of several assembled parts into a single component to reduce part count and assembly time. In these instances, design for manufacture con\ufb02icts with design for assembly, and a compromise must be found that achieves the best balance between opposing sides of the con\ufb02ict. \rBene\ufb01ts typically cited for DFM/A include (1) shorter time to bring the product to market, (2) smoother transition into production, (3) fewer components in the \ufb01nal product, (4) easier assembly, (5) lower costs of production, (6) higher product quality, and (7) greater customer satisfaction [1], [4].", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 23147, "end_char_idx": 28022, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c1e97e0-7bf2-4f52-bd94-5f7a7a84e331": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c1e97e0-7bf2-4f52-bd94-5f7a7a84e331", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec39.txt", "file_name": "sec39.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79874, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ee42b10d-a903-45b6-8ced-d8cb108f4af3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec39.txt", "file_name": "sec39.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79874, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "3a174a3d245be62ed29d80ff1d3dad5dc38752099a3abc310c72fb8b149457e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "38be49f6-1a09-49e6-9422-b95c8fdabb2d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec39.txt", "file_name": "sec39.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79874, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "bb391007471291e112e4aaadb023d1f8a99017d872fef4f4bce83ef1867ede3d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8ce63e5c-0f7d-48de-8516-a938bcd0e4e2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5944369af455b99e10474352bac23965ec122c7db62afbfb23f74bfda44032f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The guidelines are sometimes in con\ufb02ict.

One might argue that concurrent engineering is a logical extension of DFM/A because it includes collaboration of more than just design and manufacturing, and it attempts to reduce the product launch cycle. The traditional approach to launch a new product tends to separate the two functions, as illustrated in Figure 39.6(a). The product design engineer develops the new design, sometimes with little regard for the manufacturing capabilities possessed by the company. There is no interaction between design engineers and manufacturing engineers who might provide advice on these capabilities and how the product design might be altered to accommodate them. It is as if a wall exists between the two functions; when design engineering completes the design, the drawings and speci\ufb01cations are tossed over the wall so that process planning can commence. \rIn a company that practices concurrent engineering (also known as simultaneous engineering), manufacturing planning begins while the product design is being developed, as pictured in Figure 39.6(b). Manufacturing engineering becomes \r\rFIGURE 39.6 \rComparison of:\r\r(a)\r traditional productdevelopment cycle, and\r\r(b)\r productdevelopment using concurrent engineering. \r\r\rinvolved early in the product development cycle. In addition, other functions are also involved, such as \ufb01eld service, quality engineering, the manufacturing departments, vendors supplying critical components, and in some cases customers who will use the product. All of these functions can contribute to a product design that not only performs well functionally, but is also manufacturable, assemblable, inspect-able,testable,serviceable,maintainable,free of defects,and safe.All viewpoints have been combined to design a product of high quality that will deliver customer satisfaction. And through early involvement, rather than a procedure of reviewing the \ufb01nal design and suggesting changes after it is too late to conveniently make them, the total product development cycle is substantially reduced. \rConcurrent engineering embraces other objectives beyond DFM/A such as design for quality, design for life cycle, and design for cost. With the importance of quality in international competition, and the demonstrated success of those companies that have been able to produce products of high quality, one must conclude that design for quality is very important. Chapter 40 deals with quality control and includes a discussion of several quality approaches related to product design. \rDesign for life cycle refers to the product after it has been manufactured. In many cases, a product can involve a signi\ufb01cant cost to the customer beyond the purchase price. These costs include installation, maintenance and repair, spare parts, future upgrading of the product, safety during operation, and disposition of the product at the end of its useful life. The price paid for the product may be a small portion of its total cost when life cycle costs are included. Some customers (e.g., federal government) consider life cycle costs in their purchasing decisions. The manufacturer must often include service contracts that limit customer vulnerability to excessive maintenance and service costs.

Many of the DFM/A guidelines are directed at reducing product cost. \r\rProduction Planning and Control \rProduction planning and control are the manufacturing support systems concerned with logistics problems in the production function. Production planning is concerned with planning what products are to be produced, what quantities, and when. It also considers the resources required to accomplish the plan. Production control determines whether the resources to execute the plan have been provided and, if not, takes the necessary action to correct the de\ufb01ciencies. \rThe problems in production planning and control are different for different types of manufacturing. One of the important factors is the relationship between product variety and production quantity (Section 1.1.2). At one extreme is job shop production, in which different product types are each produced in low quantities. The products are often complex, consisting of many components, each of which must be processed through multiple operations. Solving the logistics problems in such a plant requires detailed planning\u2014scheduling and coordinating the large numbers of different components and processing steps for the different products. \rAt the other extreme is mass production, in which a single product (with perhaps some model variations) is produced in very large quantities (up to millions of units). The logistics problems in mass production are simple if the product and process are simple. In more complex situations, such as the production of automobiles and major appliances, the product is an assembly consisting of many components, and the facility is organized as a production line (Section 38.2). The logistics problem in operating such a plant is to get each component to the right workstation at the right time so that it can be assembled to the product as it passes through that station. Failure to solve this problem can result in stoppage of the entire production line for lack of a critical part. \rTo distinguish between these two extremes in terms of the issues in production planning and control, the planning function is emphasized in a job shop, whereas the control function is emphasized in mass production of assembled products.There are many variations between these extremes, with accompanying differences in the way production planning and control are implemented. \rFigure 39.7 presents a block diagram depicting the activities of a modern production planning and control system and their interrelationships. The activities can be divided into three phases: (1) aggregate production planning, (2) detailed planning of material and capacity requirements, and (3) purchasing and shop \ufb02oor control. Our discussion of production planning and control in this section is organized around this framework. \r39.3.1 AGGREGATE PLANNING AND THE MASTER PRODUCTION SCHEDULE \rAny manufacturing \ufb01rm must have a business plan, and the plan must include what products will be produced,how many,and when.The manufacturing plan should take into account current orders and sales forecasts, inventory levels, and plant capacity. \r\rFIGURE 39.7 Activities in a production planning and control system. \rThe aggregate production plan indicates production output levels for major product lines rather than speci\ufb01c products. It must be coordinated with the sales and marketing plan of the company. Aggregate planning is therefore a high-level corporate planning activity, although details of the planning process are delegated to staff. The aggregate plan must reconcile the marketing plans for current products and new products under development against the capacity resources available to make those products. \rThe planned output levels of the major product lines in the aggregate schedule must be converted into a speci\ufb01c schedule of individual products. This is called the master production schedule (or master schedule, for short), and it lists the products to be manufactured, when they should be completed, and in what quantities. \rThree categories of items are listed in the master schedule: (1) \ufb01rm customer orders, (2) forecasted demand, and (3) spare parts.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 31312, "end_char_idx": 36223, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22345c3a-86a0-43aa-a574-bbc59389daed": {"__data__": {"id_": "22345c3a-86a0-43aa-a574-bbc59389daed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec39.txt", "file_name": "sec39.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79874, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ee42b10d-a903-45b6-8ced-d8cb108f4af3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec39.txt", "file_name": "sec39.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79874, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "3a174a3d245be62ed29d80ff1d3dad5dc38752099a3abc310c72fb8b149457e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8ce63e5c-0f7d-48de-8516-a938bcd0e4e2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec39.txt", "file_name": "sec39.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79874, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "726138ee1f70f097bf0ad4a50f161d9ccfcb359f6331e9c94d3a48956fd3900f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca18cd60-c5a6-4375-9a2e-32684ff77142", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ee99efb88c3a97db8d0099fee7dedc9f7263aac9acb99aa643fccb5ae53ba3e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The aggregate production plan indicates production output levels for major product lines rather than speci\ufb01c products.

This is called the master production schedule (or master schedule, for short), and it lists the products to be manufactured, when they should be completed, and in what quantities. \rThree categories of items are listed in the master schedule: (1) \ufb01rm customer orders, (2) forecasted demand, and (3) spare parts. Customer orders for speci\ufb01c products usually obligate the company to a delivery date that has been promised to a customer by the sales department.The second category consists of production output levels based on forecasted demand, in which statistical forecasting techniques are applied to previous demand patterns, estimates by the sales staff, and other sources. The third category is demand for individual component parts\u2014repair parts to be stocked in the \ufb01rm\u2019s service department. Some companies exclude this third category from the master schedule because it does not represent end products. \r\rThe master production schedule must consider the lead times required to order raw materials and components, fabricate parts in the factory, and then assemble and test the \ufb01nal products. Depending on type of product, these lead times can run from several months to more than a year. It is usually considered to be \ufb01xed in the near term, meaning that changes are not allowed within about a six-week horizon. However, adjustments in the schedule beyond six weeks are possible to cope with shifts in demand or new product opportunities. It should therefore be noted that the aggregate production plan is not the only input to the master schedule. Other drivers that may cause it to deviate from the aggregate plan include new customer orders and changes in sales over the near term. \r39.3.2 MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS PLANNING \rTwo techniques for planning and controlling production are used in industry,depending on product variety and production quantities. This section covers procedures for job shop and midrange production of assembled products. Section 39.4 examines procedures appropriate for high production. \rMaterial requirements planning (MRP) is a computational procedure used to convert the master production schedule for end products into a detailed schedule for raw materials and components used in the end products. The detailed schedule indicates the quantities of each item, when it must be ordered, and when it must be delivered to implement the master schedule. Capacity requirements planning (Section 39.3.3) coordinates labor and equipment resources with material requirements. \rMRP is most appropriate for job shop and batch production of products that have multiple components, each of which must be purchased and/or fabricated. It is a technique that determines the quantities of items used in end products. Once the number of end products has been decided and included in the master production schedule, then the numbers of each component can be directly computed. For example, each car listed in the master schedule needs four tires (\ufb01ve,if the spare is included).Thus, if the production schedule calls for 1000 cars to be produced in a certain week, the plant needs to order 4000 tires for those cars. Demand for the end products may be forecasted, but materials and parts used in the end products are not. \rMRP is relatively straightforward in concept. Its application is complicated by the sheer magnitude of the data that must be processed. The master schedule speci\ufb01 es the production of \ufb01 nal products in terms of month-by-month deliveries. Each product may contain hundreds of components. These components are produced from raw materials, some of which are common among the components (e.g., sheet steel for stampings). Some of the components themselves may be common to several different products (called common use items in MRP). For each product, the components are assembled into simple subassemblies, which are added to form other subassemblies, and so on, until the \ufb01 nal products are completed. Each step in the sequence consumes time. All of these factors must be accounted for in material requirements planning. Although each calculation is simple, the large number of calculations and massive amounts of data require that MRP be implemented by computer. \rThe lead time for a job is the time that must be allowed to complete the job from start to \ufb01nish.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 35261, "end_char_idx": 40210, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca18cd60-c5a6-4375-9a2e-32684ff77142": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca18cd60-c5a6-4375-9a2e-32684ff77142", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec39.txt", "file_name": "sec39.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79874, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ee42b10d-a903-45b6-8ced-d8cb108f4af3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec39.txt", "file_name": "sec39.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79874, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "3a174a3d245be62ed29d80ff1d3dad5dc38752099a3abc310c72fb8b149457e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "22345c3a-86a0-43aa-a574-bbc59389daed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec39.txt", "file_name": "sec39.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79874, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "1977208ff311518647d8407b15099b88f2e3fcab41dd656fd4b3c710fb5acab2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "20b48bba-8193-457d-a69f-2a3e32af2fff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "78de24e34c959162b62f3f3fa6ae218b2dec2e9015b1da4593432eaf7a326a7d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The master schedule speci\ufb01 es the production of \ufb01 nal products in terms of month-by-month deliveries.

Although each calculation is simple, the large number of calculations and massive amounts of data require that MRP be implemented by computer. \rThe lead time for a job is the time that must be allowed to complete the job from start to \ufb01nish. There are two kinds of lead times in MRP: ordering lead times and manufacturing lead times. Ordering lead time is the time required from initiation of the purchase requisition to receipt of the item from the vendor. If the item is a raw material stocked by the vendor, the ordering lead time should be relatively short, perhaps a few days. If the item is fabricated, the lead time may be substantial, perhaps several months. Manufacturing lead time is the time required to produce the item in the company\u2019s own plant, from order release to completion. It includes lead times for both making the parts and assembling the end products. \rInputs to the MRP System For the MRP processor to function properly, it must receive inputs from several \ufb01les: (1) master production schedule, (2) bill of materials \ufb01le, (3) inventory records, and (4) capacity requirements planning. Figure 39.7 shows the data \ufb02ow into the MRP processor and the recipients of its output reports. \rThe master production schedule was discussed in Section 39.3.1, and capacity requirements planning is covered in Section 39.3.3. The bill-of-materials \ufb01 le lists the component parts and subassemblies that make up each product. It is used to compute the requirements for raw materials and components used in the end products listed in the master schedule. The inventory record \ufb01 le identi\ufb01es each item (by part number) and provides a time-phased record of its inventory status. This means that not only is the current quantity of the item listed, but also any future changes in inventory status that will occur and when they will occur. \rHow MRP Works Based on the inputs from the master schedule, bill-of-materials \ufb01le, and inventory record \ufb01le, the MRP processor computes how many of each component and raw material will be needed in future time periods by \u201cexploding\u201d the end product schedule to include these items. How many tires and other components must be ordered to produce the numbers of cars listed in each time period (e.g., each week) of the master production schedule? \rThe MRP computations must deal with several complicating factors. First, component and subassembly quantities must be adjusted for any inventories on hand or on order. Second, quantities of common use items must be combined during parts explosion to obtain a total requirement for each component and raw material in the schedule. Third, the time-phased delivery of end products must be converted into time-phased requirements for components and materials by factoring in the appropriate lead times. For every unit of \ufb01nal product listed in the master schedule, the required number of components of each type must be ordered or fabricated, taking into account its ordering and/or manufacturing lead times. For each component, the raw material must be ordered, accounting for its ordering lead time. And assembly lead times must be considered in the scheduling of subassemblies and \ufb01nal products. \rOutput Reports MRP generates various output reports that can be used in planning and managing plant operations. The reports include (1) order releases, which authorize the orders planned by the MRP system; (2) planned order releases in future periods; (3) rescheduling notices, indicating changes in due dates for open orders; (4) cancellation notices, which indicate that certain open orders have been canceled due to changes in the master schedule; (5) inventory status reports; (6) performance reports; (7) exception reports, showing deviations from schedule, overdue orders, scrap, and so forth; and (8) inventory forecasts, which project inventory levels in future periods.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 39286, "end_char_idx": 43833, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20b48bba-8193-457d-a69f-2a3e32af2fff": {"__data__": {"id_": "20b48bba-8193-457d-a69f-2a3e32af2fff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec39.txt", "file_name": "sec39.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79874, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ee42b10d-a903-45b6-8ced-d8cb108f4af3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec39.txt", "file_name": "sec39.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79874, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "3a174a3d245be62ed29d80ff1d3dad5dc38752099a3abc310c72fb8b149457e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca18cd60-c5a6-4375-9a2e-32684ff77142", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec39.txt", "file_name": "sec39.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79874, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "14e02ae181a4c73dfc461511989e33604d9ff4ff1b67a3cf08910931248d15c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e400bbb0-0fba-4cb4-b5fd-a4d70806c0bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "88698e8abbdd6eadb1c98871cdc6da3263c2753fc125dbf138f3d21ec3980117", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "For each component, the raw material must be ordered, accounting for its ordering lead time.

It is also concerned with identifying the \ufb01rm\u2019s long-term future capacity needs. Finally and importantly, capacity planning serves to identify production resource limitations so that a realistic master production schedule can be planned. \rA realistic master schedule must take into account the manufacturing capabilities of the plant that is to make the products. The \ufb01rm must be aware of its production capacity and must plan for changes in capacity to meet changing production requirements speci\ufb01ed in the master schedule. The relationship between capacity planning and other functions in production planning and control is shown in Figure 39.7. The master schedule is reduced to material and component requirements using MRP. These requirements provide estimates of the required labor hours and other resources needed to produce the components.The required resources are then compared to plant capacity over the planning horizon. If the master schedule is not compatible with plant capacity, adjustments must be made either in the schedule or in plant capacity. \rPlant capacity can be adjusted in the short term and in the long term. Short-term capacity adjustments include (1) employment levels\u2014increasing or decreasing the number of workers in the plant; (2) shift hours\u2014increasing or decreasing the number of labor hours per shift through the use of overtime or reduced hours; (3) number of work shifts\u2014increasing or decreasing the number of shifts worked per production period by authorizing evening and night shifts and/or weekend shifts; \r(4) \rinventory stockpiling\u2014this tactic is used to maintain steady employment levels during slow demand periods; (5) order backlogs\u2014delaying deliveries to the customer during busy periods when production resources are insuf\ufb01cient to keep up with demand; and (6) subcontracting\u2014contracting work to outside shops during busy periods or taking in extra work during slack periods. \r\rLong-term capacity adjustments include possible changes in production capacity that generally require long lead times, including the following types of decisions: (1) new equipment\u2014investments in additional machines, more productive machines, or new types of machines to match future changes in product design; (2) new plants\u2014 construction of new plants or purchase of existing plants from other companies; and \r\r(3) \rplant closings\u2014closing plants not needed in the future. \r\r\r39.3.4 SHOP FLOOR CONTROL \rThe third phase in production planning and control in Figure 39.7 is concerned with releasing production orders, monitoring and controlling progress of the orders, and acquiring up-to-date information on order status. The purchasing department is responsible for these functions among suppliers.The term shop \ufb02 oor control is used to describe these functions when accomplished in the company\u2019s own factories. In basic terms, shop \ufb02oor control is concerned with managing work-in-progress in the factory.

In basic terms, shop \ufb02oor control is concerned with managing work-in-progress in the factory. It is most relevant in job shop and batch production, where there are a variety of different orders in the shop that must be scheduled and tracked according to their relative priorities. \rA typical shop \ufb02oor control system consists of three modules: (1) order release, \r(2) order scheduling, and (3) order progress. The three modules and how they relate to other functions in the factory are depicted in Figure 39.8. The computer software that supports shop \ufb02oor control is referred to as a manufacturing execution system, which includes the capability to interact in real time with users seeking status information in any of the three phases. \r\rOrder Release Order release in shop \ufb02oor control generates the documents needed to process a production order through the factory.The documents are sometimes called the shop packet; it typically consists of (1) route sheet, (2) material requisitions to draw the starting materials from stores, (3) job cards to report direct labor time used on the order, (4) move tickets to authorize transport of parts to subsequent work centers in the routing, and (5) parts list\u2014required for assembly jobs. In a traditional factory, these are paper documents that move with the production order and are used to track its progress through the shop. In modern factories, automated methods such as bar code technology and shop \ufb02oor computers are used to monitor order status, making some or all of the paper documents unnecessary. \rOrder release is driven by two principal inputs, as indicated in Figure 39.8: (1) material requirements planning, which provides the authorization to produce; and \r(2) engineering and manufacturing database that indicates product structure and process planning details required to generate the documents that accompany the order through the shop. \r\rOrder Scheduling Order scheduling assigns the production orders to work centers in the factory. It serves as the dispatching function in production control. In order scheduling, a dispatch list is prepared indicating which orders should be accomplished at each work center. It also provides relative priorities for the different jobs (e.g., by showing due dates for each job). The dispatch list helps the department foreman assign work and allocate resources to achieve the master schedule. \rOrder scheduling addresses two problems in production planning and control: machine loading and job sequencing. To schedule production orders through the factory, they must \ufb01rst be assigned to work centers. Assigning orders to work centers is called machine loading. Loading all of the work centers in the plant is called shop loading. Since the number of production orders is likely to exceed the number of work centers, each work center will have a queue of orders waiting to be processed. \rJob sequencing deals with the problem of deciding the sequence in which to process jobs through a given machine. The processing sequence is decided by means of priorities among the jobs in the queue. The relative priorities are determined by a function called priority control. Some of the rules used to establish priorities for production orders in a plant include (1) \ufb01 rst-come-\ufb01 rst-serve\u2014 orders are processed in the sequence in which they arrive at the work center; (2) earliest due date\u2014orders with earlier due dates are given higher priorities; (3) shortest processing time\u2014orders with shorter processing times are given higher priorities; and (4) least slack time\u2014orders with the least slack in their schedule are given higher priorities (slack time is de\ufb01ned as the difference between the time remaining until due date and the process time remaining). When a job is completed at one work center, it is moved to the next machine in its routing. It becomes part of the machine loading for that work center, and priority control is again used to determine the sequence among jobs to be processed at that machine. \rOrder Progress Order progress in shop \ufb02oor control monitors the status of the orders, work-in-process, and other parameters in the plant that indicate progress and performance. The objective is to provide information to manage production based on data collected from the factory. \rVarious techniques are available to collect data from factory operations. The techniques range from clerical procedures requiring workers to submit paper forms that are later compiled, to highly automated systems requiring minimal human participation.The term factory data collection system is sometimes used for these techniques.

These reports are helpful to management in deciding resource allocation issues, authorizing overtime, and identifying problem areas that adversely affect achievement of the master production schedule. \r39.3.5 ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING \r\rThe \ufb01 rst MRP systems released in the 1970s were limited to the planning of purchase orders and production work orders derived from the master production schedule. They did not include capacity planning and feedback of data from the factory. These de\ufb01ciencies became apparent by the 1980s, and additional capabilities were added to the basic MRP packages, including capacity requirements planning and shop \ufb02oor control. The term manufacturing resource planning was used to distinguish the enhanced systems from the initial material requirements planning, and the abbreviation MRP II was adopted. Manufacturing resource planning can be de\ufb01 ned \u201cas a computer-based system for planning, scheduling, and controlling the materials, resources, and supporting activities needed to meet the master production schedule.\u201d1 MRP II integrates material requirements planning, capacity requirements planning, and shop \ufb02oor control into one system. \rFurther improvements were made to MRP II during the 1990s by adding features that went beyond just the manufacturing activities of a \ufb01rm by including all of the operations and functions of the entire enterprise.Also,the new packages,called enterprise resource planning, were applicable to service organizations as well as \ufb01rms in the production industries. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a computer-based \u201csystem that organizes and integrates all of the data and business functions of an organization through a single, central database.\u201d2 For a manufacturing \ufb01rm, ERP accomplishes the functions of MRP II.Additional functions in most ERP systems include sales and service, marketing, logistics, distribution, inventory control, accounting and \ufb01nance, human resources, and customer relationship management. ERP systems consist of multiple software modules, each devoted to its particular function. A user company may elect to include only certain modules of particular interest in its ERP system. For example, a service organization may have no need for modules related to manufacturing. \rToday\u2019s ERP systems are based on open architecture standards, which means that a user company can purchase certain modules from one company and other modules from a different company and integrate them into their own ERP system. This open architecture feature gave rise to the term ERP II during the early 2000s. Also, enterprise resource planning can be implemented as a cloud-based system, in which the user company\u2019s data reside in large data centers external to the company and accessed through the Internet [19]. This permits them to avoid the expenses of investing in and maintaining their own central database. \rERP II is installed as a client-server system that serves the entire company rather than individual plants as MRP and MRP II often do. Employees access and work with the system using their personal computers. Because ERP has only one database, it avoids problems of data redundancy and con\ufb02icting information that arise when an organization maintains multiple databases. It also minimizes time delays and compatibility issues associated with different databases and software modules.

Work-in-process and other inventories are \r1M. P. Groover. Automation, Production Systems, and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing [6], p. 762. 2M. P. Groover. Automation, Production Systems, and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing [6], p. 763. \r\rviewed as waste that should be eliminated.Inventory ties up investment funds and takes up space. To reduce this form of waste, the JIT approach includes a number of principles and procedures aimed at reducing inventories, either directly or indirectly. JIT is an important component of lean production, a principal goal of which is to reduce all forms of waste in production operations. Lean production is described in Section 39.6. \rJust-in-time procedures have proven most effective in high-volume repetitive manufacturing, such as the automobile industry [10].The potential for in-process inventory accumulation in this type of manufacturing is signi\ufb01cant because both the quantities of products and the number of components per product are large. A just-in-time system produces exactly the right number of each component required to satisfy the next operation in the manufacturing sequence just when that component is needed; that is,\u201cjust in time.\u201dThe ideal batch size is one part.As a practical matter,more than one part are produced at a time, but the batch size is kept small. Under JIT, producing too many units is to be avoided as much as producing too few units. JIT has been adopted by many U.S. companies in both the automotive and other manufacturing industries. \rAlthough the principal theme in JIT is inventory reduction, this cannot simply be mandated. Several requisites must be pursued to make it possible: (1) stable production schedules; (2) small batch sizes and short setup times; (3) on-time delivery; (4) defect-free components and materials; (5) reliable production equipment; \r(6) pull system of production control; (7) a work force that is capable, committed, and cooperative; and (8) a dependable supplier base. \rStable Schedule For JIT to be successful, work must \ufb02ow smoothly with minimal perturbations from normal operations. Perturbations require changes in operating procedures\u2014increases and decreases in production rate, unscheduled setups, variations from the regular work routine, and other exceptions. When perturbations occur in downstream operations (i.e., \ufb01nal assembly), they tend to be ampli\ufb01ed in upstream operations (i.e.,parts feeding).A master production schedule that remains relatively constant over time is one way of achieving smooth work \ufb02ow and minimizing disturbances and changes in production. The term production leveling is sometimes used for this practice of maintaining a constant production output. \rSmall Batch Sizes and Setup Reduction Two requirements for minimizing inventories are small batch sizes and short setup times. Large batch sizes mean longer production runs and higher inventory levels, both in-process and \ufb01nal inventories. Long setup times are costly in both labor and lost production time, but they necessitate long production runs to economically justify the setups.Thus,large batch sizes and long setup times are closely correlated, and they result in higher operating costs in the factory. Instead of tolerating them, efforts are focused on reducing setup time, thereby permitting smaller batch sizes and lower work-in-process levels.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 54735, "end_char_idx": 59260, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a343349-6273-42b7-a747-9940ddd14342": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a343349-6273-42b7-a747-9940ddd14342", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec39.txt", "file_name": "sec39.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79874, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ee42b10d-a903-45b6-8ced-d8cb108f4af3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec39.txt", "file_name": "sec39.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79874, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "3a174a3d245be62ed29d80ff1d3dad5dc38752099a3abc310c72fb8b149457e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "172aff7e-1657-4ff8-8b4a-bea67e885b1d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec39.txt", "file_name": "sec39.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 79874, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "c84784003d223d53b2b22794ae0f96f801b80e39602e94e603248e83835a8ce4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e6e22149-1d40-4c0f-b8c0-0af2de4eb4a5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0a6bc7bc1b84d70817232f351abcfca851602f19b79518cc5f06f90bfaad49f0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The term production leveling is sometimes used for this practice of maintaining a constant production output. \rSmall Batch Sizes and Setup Reduction Two requirements for minimizing inventories are small batch sizes and short setup times.

These approaches have sometimes resulted in dramatic decreases in setup times. Reductions of 95% and greater have been reported in the literature.3 \r3Suzaki, K. The New Manufacturing Challenge: Techniques for Continuous Improvement, Free Press, New York, 1987. \rOn-Time Delivery, Zero Defects, and Reliable Equipment Success of just-in-time production requires near perfection in on-time delivery, parts quality, and equipment reliability. The small lot sizes and parts buffers used in JIT require parts to be delivered before stock-outs occur at downstream stations. Otherwise, production must be suspended at these stations for lack of parts. If the delivered parts are defective, they cannot be used in assembly. This tends to encourage zero defects in parts fabrication. Workers inspect their own output to make sure it is right before it proceeds to the next operation. \rLow work-in-process also requires reliable production equipment. Machines that break down cannot be tolerated in a JIT production system. This emphasizes the need for reliable equipment designs and preventive maintenance. Toyota\u2019s Total Productive Maintenance program is discussed in Section 39.6.1. \rPull System of Production Control JIT requires a pull system of production control, in which the order to produce parts at a given workstation comes from the downstream station that uses those parts. As the supply of parts becomes exhausted at a given station, it \u201cplaces an order\u201d at the upstream workstation to replenish the supply. This order provides the authorization for the upstream station to produce the needed parts. This procedure, repeated at each workstation throughout the plant, has the effect of pulling parts through the production system. By contrast, a push system of production operates by supplying parts to each station in the plant, in effect driving the work from upstream stations to downstream stations. MRP is a push system. The risk in a push system is to overload the factory by scheduling more work than it can handle. This results in large queues of parts in front of machines that cannot keep up with arriving work. A poorly implemented MRP system, one that does not include capacity planning, manifests this risk. \rOne famous pull system is the kanban system used by Toyota Motors. Kanban (pronounced kahn-bahn) is a Japanese word meaning card. The kanban system of production control is based on the use of cards to authorize production and work \ufb02 ow in the plant. There are two types of kanbans: (1) production kanbans, and (2) transport kanbans. A production kanban authorizes production of a batch of parts. The parts are placed in containers, so the batch must consist of just enough parts to \ufb01ll the container. Production of additional parts is not permitted. The transport kanban authorizes movement of the container of parts to the next station in the sequence. \rRefer to Figure 39.9 as the operation of a kanban system is explained.

A production kanban authorizes production of a batch of parts. The parts are placed in containers, so the batch must consist of just enough parts to \ufb01ll the container. Production of additional parts is not permitted. The transport kanban authorizes movement of the container of parts to the next station in the sequence. \rRefer to Figure 39.9 as the operation of a kanban system is explained. The \ufb01gure shows four stations, but B and C are the stations to focus on here. Station B is the supplier in this pair, and station C is the consumer. Station C supplies downstream station D. B is supplied by upstream station A.

The worker then places the transport kanban in the full container, which authorizes its movement to station C. The production kanban on the rack at station B authorizes production of a new batch of parts. Station B produces more than one part style, perhaps for several other downstream stations in addition to C. The scheduling of work is determined by the order in which the production kanbans are placed on the rack. \rThe kanban pull system between stations A and B and between stations C and D operates the same as it does between stations B and C, described here. This system of production control avoids unnecessary paperwork. The cards are used over and over rather than generating new production and transport orders every cycle. An apparent disadvantage is the considerable labor involvement in material handling (moving the cards and containers between stations); however, it is claimed that this promotes teamwork and cooperation among workers. \rWorkforce and Supplier Base Another requirement of a JIT production system is workers who are cooperative, committed, and capable of performing multiple tasks.The workers must be \ufb02exible to produce a variety of part styles at their respective stations, to inspect the quality of their work, and to deal with minor technical problems with the production equipment so that major breakdowns do not occur. \rJust-in-timeextends to thesuppliersofthecompany,whoareheldtothe samestandards of on-time delivery, zero defects, and other JIT requisites as the company itself. Some of the vendor policies used by companies to implement JIT include (1) reducing the total number of suppliers, (2) selecting suppliers with proven records for meeting quality and delivery standards, (3) establishing long-term partnerships with suppliers, and (4) selecting suppliers that are located near the company\u2019s manufacturing plant. \r\rLean Production \rJust-in-time delivery systems are an important aspect of lean production, which is focused on reducing waste in production operations, and just-in-time reduces the waste of too much inventory. Lean production can be de\ufb01ned as \u201can adaptation of mass production in which workers and work cells are made more \ufb02exible and ef\ufb01 cient by adopting methods that reduce waste in all forms.\u201d4 Its origins are traced to the Toyota Production System at Toyota Motors in Japan starting in the 1950s (Historical Note 39.1). Although its initial applications were in the automotive industry, the objective of minimizing waste is important in all industries. \rHistorical Note 39.1 Toyota Production System and lean production [7] \rTaiichi Ohno (1912\u20131990) is the man credited with president at Toyota Motors when the company was developing the Toyota Production System in Japan struggling to overcome the war\u2019s devastating imfollowing World War II.

Ohno recognized that Toyota\u2019s plants had to operate on a much smaller scale and be more \ufb02exible. The situation, as well as his own aversion to waste, motivated him to develop some of the procedures of the Toyota Production System to reduce waste and increase ef\ufb01ciency and product quality. He and his colleagues experimented with and perfected the procedures over several decades, including just-in-time delivery, the kanban system, setup time reduction, and control of product quality. \rOhno did not use the term \u201clean production\u201d to refer to his system. In fact, he died before the term came into prominence, so he may never have heard of it. In his book, he called it the \u201cToyota Production System\u201d [12].The term lean production was coined by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to refer to the techniques and procedures used at Toyota that explained its success in producing so ef\ufb01 ciently cars with such high quality. The research was known as the International Motor Vehicle Program and documented in the book The Machine that Changed the World (published in 1991).The term lean production appeared in the book\u2019s subtitle. \r\r\rIn effect, lean production means accomplishing more work with fewer resources by eliminating waste in manufacturing operations.Activities in manufacturing can be classi\ufb01ed into three categories: (1) actual work activities that add value such as processing steps that alter the product in a positive way, (2) auxiliary work activities that support the actual work such as loading and unloading a production machine, and (3) wasteful activities that do not add value and do not support the value-adding activities. If these wasteful activities were omitted, the product would not be adversely affected. \rSeven forms of waste in manufacturing were identi\ufb01ed in the Toyota Production System: (1) production of defective parts, (2) production of more parts than needed, (3) excessive inventories, (4) unnecessary processing steps, (5) unnecessary movement of workers, (6) unnecessary handling and transport of materials, and (7) workers waiting [12].The various systems and procedures developed at Toyota were designed to reduce or eliminate these seven forms of waste. \rThe principal components of the Toyota Production System were just-in-time delivery, autonomation (which has been de\ufb01ned as \u201cautomation with a human touch\u201d),5 and worker involvement. Just-in-time delivery is described in Section 39.4. The other two components are discussed in the following sections. More complete treatments of lean production and/or the Toyota Production System are given in several of our references [3], [6], [7], [10], and [12]. \r\r39.5.1 AUTONOMATION \rAutonomation refers to the design of production machines that operate autonomously so long as they function the way they are supposed to. If and when they do not operate the way they should, they are designed to stop. Circumstances that would trigger a machine to stop include producing defective parts and producing more than the number of parts needed. Other aspects of autonomation include error prevention and high reliability. \rStop the Process The underlying principle is that when something goes wrong, the process should be stopped so that corrective action can be taken. This applies to both automatic machines and manually operated processes. Production machines in \r5This is the way Taiichi Ohno described autonomation. \r\rthe Toyota Production System are designed with sensors and automatic stop devices that are activated when a defective unit is produced or when the required number of units have been made. Accordingly, when a machine stops, it draws attention, either to make adjustments to the process to avoid future defects, or to change over the process for the next batch of parts. The alternative to autonomation is that the machine would continue to make bad parts or it would make too many parts. \rThe notion of \u201cstop the process\u201d can also be applied to manual production, such as the \ufb01nal assembly line in an automobile plant. Workers on the line are empowered to stop the line when they discover a problem such as a quality defect. They do this by means of pull cords that are located along the line.

Downtime on an assembly line draws attention and is costly to the plant. Signi\ufb01cant efforts are made to \ufb01x the problem that caused the line to be stopped. Defective components must be avoided by pursuing the goal of zero defects. \rError Prevention A second objective of autonomation is preventing mistakes. Mistakes in manufacturing include using the wrong tool, starting a process with the wrong raw material, omitting a processing step on a part, neglecting to add a component in an assembly operation, incorrectly locating a part in a \ufb01xture, and incorrectly locating the \ufb01xture on the machine. To avoid these and other kinds of mistakes, devices are designed to detect abnormal conditions in a given operation. Examples include instruments to detect overweight parts, counting devices to determine whether the correct number of spot welds has been made, and sensors to determine whether a part has been properly located in a \ufb01xture. When the device encounters a mistake, it is designed to respond by stopping the process or providing an audible or visible alert that an error has occurred. \rTotal Productive Maintenance Just-in-time delivery requires production equipment that is highly reliable.When a production machine breaks down,it disrupts the delivery of parts to the downstream workstation, forcing that machine to be idle. JIT does not provide for inventory buffers to keep production going when breakdowns occur. Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) is a program that aims to minimize production losses due to machine failures, malfunctions, and poor utilization. One of the elements of the program is to hold workers who operate equipment responsible for routine tasks such as inspecting, cleaning, and lubricating their machines. In some cases, they also make minor repairs on their equipment. \rThree categories of maintenance are performed on a plant\u2019s equipment by trained specialists: (1) emergency maintenance, which involves the immediate repair of a machine that has broken down; (2) preventive maintenance, which consists of routine repairs designed to avoid or minimize breakdowns; and (3) predictive maintenance, which attempts to anticipate machine malfunctions by monitoring the equipment for signs of problems and abnormal behavior. Emergency maintenance is undesirable because it means the machine is out of action and production has ceased. Preventive maintenance can be scheduled during hours when the machine is not running, for example, during the third shift in a plant that runs two shifts. Predictive maintenance is performed while the machine is running.A TPM program integrates preventive maintenance and predictive maintenance in order to avoid emergency maintenance. \rOne of the metrics used in TPM is overall equipment effectiveness, which combines several individual measures of a production machine\u2019s operation, as follows: \rOEE ! AUYros (39.1) \r\rwhere OEE ! overall equipment effectiveness; A ! availability, a reliability measure de\ufb01ned as the proportion uptime on the equipment; U ! utilization, the proportion of the available time that the machine is actually running; Y ! yield of acceptable product, a quality measure de\ufb01ned as the proportion of good product to total output; and ros ! ratio of the actual operating speed of the machine relative to its designed operating speed. The objective of TPM is to make OEE as close to 100% as possible. \r\r39.5.2 WORKER INVOLVEMENT \rThis is the third component of lean production, as practiced in the Toyota Production System.

Three aspects of worker involvement are discussed in the following paragraphs: (1) continuous improvement, (2) visual management, and (3) standard work procedures. \rContinuous Improvement This topic was brie\ufb02y discussed in the context of manufacturing engineering in Section 39.2.1. In lean production, continuous improvement projects are carried out by worker teams.The projects are focused on problems related to productivity, quality, safety, maintenance, and any other area that is of interest to the organization. Members of each team are selected on the basis of their knowledge of the particular problem area.Teams may consist of workers from more than one department. They perform their regular duties in their respective departments and serve on the team part-time, holding several meetings per month, with each meeting lasting about an hour. The company bene\ufb01ts when the problems are solved, and the workers bene\ufb01 t by being recognized for their contributions and improving their technical skills. \rVisual Management This refers to the notion that the status of a work situation is usually obvious just be looking at it. If something is amiss, it should be self-evident to the observer. This applies to individual workstations. If a machine has stopped, this can be seen. It also applies to the entire plant. It should be possible to view the entire interior of the plant, and so objects that unnecessarily obstruct the view are removed. For example, build-up of work-in-process is limited to a certain maximum height in the plant (of course, JIT should limit the build-up of inventory anyway). \rWorkers are involved in visual management in several ways. For example, the kanbans used in just-in-time delivery systems are a visual mechanism for controlling production and movement of materials in the plant. Also, workers and supervisors can observe the status of plant operations through the use of andon boards, which are overhead light panels located above sections of the plant. Using different colored lights, they indicate the status of operations. For instance, green indicates normal operation, red indicates a line stoppage. Other color codes may be used to indicate impending material shortages, need for a setup changeover, and so forth. Other elements of visual management include the extensive use of drawings, pictures, and diagrams in worker training programs, and promoting good housekeeping practices at employees\u2019 workstations (so that workers work in a clean and visible work space). \rStandard Work Procedures Standardized work procedures and standard times are used in the Toyota Production System with the objectives of increasing productivity, balancing workloads, and minimizing work-in-process. The procedures document \r\r\rMachines \r\rFIGURE 39.10 \rU-shaped work cellwith three workers performing sevenoperations at sevenmachines. The arrows indicate the pathsfollowed by eachworker during eachwork cycle, and thenumbers in circles indicate the operationseach worker performs.Task times at each machine are labeled inside each machine block. \rStartingwork partsin \r\r\rFinished work parts out \rthe work elements and their element times in each repetitive task performed by workers. For workers responsible for multiple machines operating under semi-automatic cycle, the procedures indicate the sequence of machines and the task required at each machine.The sequence is designed to minimize idle times of the worker and machines. One of the objectives in designing these tasks and work sequences is to make the rate of parts production in these operations equal to the respective demand rates for the parts. When this is achieved, overproduction is avoided and work-in-process inventory is minimized, consistent with just-in-time delivery. \rProduction is often organized within work cells, which are teams of workers and machines arranged in sequential order to produce parts in small batch sizes.

If they did, the product was shipped. The modern view of quality control encompasses a broader scope of activities, including various quality programs such as statistical process control and Six Sigma as well as modern inspection technologies such as coordinate measuring machines and machine vision. This chapter discusses these and other quality and inspection topics that are relevant today in modern manufacturing operations. The coverage begins with the topic of product quality. \r\r\r\r\r\rProduct Quality \rThe dictionary de\ufb01 nes quality as \u201cthe degree of excellence which a thing possesses,\u201d or \u201cthe features that make something what it is\u201d\u2014its characteristic elements and attributes.The American Society for Quality (ASQ) de\ufb01 nes quality as \u201cthe totality of features and characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy given needs\u201d [2]. \rIn a manufactured product, quality has two aspects [4]: \r(1) product features and (2) freedom from de\ufb01 ciencies. Product features are the characteristics of the product that result from design. They are the functional and aesthetic features of the item intended to appeal to and provide satisfaction to the customer. In an automobile, these features include the size of the car, its styling, the \ufb01nish of the body, gas mileage, reliability, reputation of the manufacturer, and similar aspects. They also include the available options for the customer to choose. The sum of a product\u2019s features usually de\ufb01 nes its grade; this relates to the level in the market at which the product is aimed. Cars (and most other products) come in different grades. Some cars provide basic transportation because that is what some customers want, while others are upscale for \r\r1058 \r\rconsumers willing to spend more to own a \u201cbetter product.\u201d The features of a product are decided in design, and they generally determine the inherent cost of the product. Superior features and more of them mean higher cost. \rFreedom from de\ufb01 ciencies means that the product does what it is supposed to do (within the limitations of its design features), that it is absent of defects and out-oftolerance conditions, and that no parts are missing. This aspect of quality includes components and subassemblies of the product as well as the product itself. Freedom from de\ufb01ciencies means conforming to design speci\ufb01cations, which is accomplished in manufacturing. Although the inherent cost to make a product is a function of its design, minimizing the product\u2019s cost to the lowest possible level within the limits set by its design is largely a matter of avoiding defects, tolerance deviations, and other errors during production. Costs of these de\ufb01ciencies make a long list indeed: scrapped parts, larger lot sizes for scrap allowances, rework, reinspection, sortation, customer complaints and returns, warranty costs and customer allowances, lost sales, and lost good will in the marketplace. \rThus, product features are the aspect of quality for which the design department is responsible. Product features determine to a large degree the price that a company can charge for its products. Freedom from de\ufb01ciencies is the quality aspect for which the manufacturing departments are responsible. The ability to minimize these de\ufb01ciencies has an important in\ufb02uence on the cost of the product. These generalities oversimplify the way things work, because the responsibility for high quality extends well beyond the design and manufacturing functions in an organization.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4499, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf1b421e-20df-49c1-a7ce-921eae19970b": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf1b421e-20df-49c1-a7ce-921eae19970b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec40.txt", "file_name": "sec40.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 63482, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a4023a0-0ef8-430f-b39b-b0c3fec8172b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec40.txt", "file_name": "sec40.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 63482, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "0fb480b5a647e6a8f45156c21ddc3ccb8aaccdc795d6ab014a462b2bb102a648", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d132877c-0ba0-4233-9d3c-47d998292a50", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec40.txt", "file_name": "sec40.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 63482, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "f86d35bda917282b09a21a42e5560a758bed195c03e71bd2ad23d02a872ddf11", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "00784e0e-6ab0-42ca-89ff-e0c93169c399", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0d62c23d3343b9ea90833d822f7a3366981bad66c60ece407e28e2e4db6417a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Costs of these de\ufb01ciencies make a long list indeed: scrapped parts, larger lot sizes for scrap allowances, rework, reinspection, sortation, customer complaints and returns, warranty costs and customer allowances, lost sales, and lost good will in the marketplace. \rThus, product features are the aspect of quality for which the design department is responsible.

In a machining operation, which is one of the most accurate processes, the machined parts may appear to be identical, but close inspection reveals dimensional differences from one part to the next. Manufacturing variations can be divided into two types: random and assignable. \rRandom variations are caused by many factors: human variability within each operation cycle, variations in raw materials, machine vibration, and so on. Individually, these factors may not amount to much, but collectively the errors can be signi\ufb01cant enough to cause trouble unless they are within the tolerances for the part. Random variations typically form a normal statistical distribution. The output of the process tends to cluster about the mean value, in terms of the product\u2019s quality characteristic of interest (e.g., length, diameter). A large proportion of the population of parts is centered around the mean,with fewer parts away from the mean.When the only variations in the process are of this type, the process is said to be in statistical control. This kind of variability will continue so long as the process is operating normally. It is when the process deviates from this normal operating condition that variations of the second type appear. \rAssignable variations indicate an exception from normal operating conditions. Something has occurred in the process that is not accounted for by random variations. Reasons for assignable variations include operator mistakes, defective raw materials, tool failures, machine malfunctions, and so on. Assignable variations in manufacturing usually betray themselves by causing the output to deviate from the normal distribution. The process is no longer in statistical control. \r\r0.27% outside\rProcess capability relates to the normal variations inherent in the output when the process is in statistical control. By de\ufb01 nition, process capability equals 3 standard deviations about the mean output value (a total of 6 standard deviations), \rPC \" m  3 s (40.1) \r\rwhere PC  process capability; m  process mean, which is set at the nominal value of the product characteristic when bilateral tolerancing is used (Section 5.1.1); and s  standard deviation of the process. Assumptions underlying this de\ufb01 nition are \r(1) steady state operation has been achieved and the process is in statistical control, and (2) the output is normally distributed. Under these assumptions, 99.73% of the parts produced will have output values that fall within 3.0s of the mean. \rThe process capability of a given manufacturing operation is not always known, and experiments must be conducted to assess it. Methods are available to estimate the natural tolerance limits based on a sampling of the process. \rThe issue of tolerances is critical to product quality. Design engineers tend to assign dimensional tolerances to components and assemblies based on their judgment of how size variations will affect function and performance. Conventional wisdom is that closer tolerances beget better performance. Small regard is given to the cost resulting from tolerances that are unduly tight relative to process capability. As tolerance is reduced, the cost of achieving the tolerance tends to increase because additional processing steps may be needed and/or more accurate and expensive production machines may be required. The design engineer should be aware of this relationship. Although primary consideration must be given to function in assigning tolerances, cost is also a factor, and any relief that can be given to the manufacturing departments in the form of wider tolerances without sacri\ufb01cing product function is worthwhile. \rDesign tolerances must be compatible with process capability. It serves no useful purpose to specify a tolerance of 0.025 mm (0.001 in) on a dimension if the process capability is signi\ufb01cantly wider than 0.025 mm (0.001 in).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3663, "end_char_idx": 8482, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00784e0e-6ab0-42ca-89ff-e0c93169c399": {"__data__": {"id_": "00784e0e-6ab0-42ca-89ff-e0c93169c399", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec40.txt", "file_name": "sec40.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 63482, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a4023a0-0ef8-430f-b39b-b0c3fec8172b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec40.txt", "file_name": "sec40.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 63482, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "0fb480b5a647e6a8f45156c21ddc3ccb8aaccdc795d6ab014a462b2bb102a648", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf1b421e-20df-49c1-a7ce-921eae19970b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec40.txt", "file_name": "sec40.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 63482, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "061f4bac93dd12080b5e551a41173c266645a78880e3f7f705980ccfc048ce56", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ffe16c66-8e33-4f95-8b47-962d37f434bd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "90f2e42cb6a398a92acdeaf821d51cf0c76256e95f5585e9b2751759d0e6ac8c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Conventional wisdom is that closer tolerances beget better performance.

It serves no useful purpose to specify a tolerance of 0.025 mm (0.001 in) on a dimension if the process capability is signi\ufb01cantly wider than 0.025 mm (0.001 in). Either the tolerance should be opened further (if design functionality permits), or a different manufacturing process should be selected. Ideally, the speci\ufb01ed tolerance should be greater than the process capability. If function and available processes prevent this, then sorting must be included in the manufacturing sequence to inspect every unit and separate those that meet speci\ufb01cation from those that do not. \rDesign tolerances can be speci\ufb01ed as being equal to process capability as de\ufb01ned in Equation (40.1).The upper and lower boundaries of this range are known as the natural tolerance limits. When design tolerances are set equal to the natural tolerance limits, then 99.73% of the parts will be within tolerance and 0.27% will be outside the limits. Any increase in the tolerance range will reduce the percentage of defective parts. \rTolerances are not usually set at their natural limits by product design engineers; tolerances are speci\ufb01ed based on the allowable variability that will achieve required function and performance. It is useful to know the ratio of the speci\ufb01ed tolerance relative to the process capability. This is indicated by the process capability index \rT\rPCI \" (40.2)\r\r6s where PCI \" process capability index; T \" tolerance range\u2014the difference between upper and lower limits of the speci\ufb01ed tolerance; and 6s \" natural tolerance limits. The underlying assumption in this de\ufb01nition is that the process mean is set equal to the nominal design speci\ufb01cation, so that the numerator and denominator in Equation (40.2) are centered about the same value. \rTABLE \u2022 40.1 Defect rate when tolerance is de\ufb01ned in terms of number of standard deviations of the process, given that the process is operating in statistical control. \r\r\r\rTable 40.1 shows the effect of various multiples of standard deviation on defect rate (i.e., proportion of out-of-tolerance parts). The desire to achieve very-lowfraction defect rates has led to the popular notion of \u201csix sigma\u201d limits in quality control. Achieving six sigma limits virtually eliminates defects in a manufactured product, assuming the process is maintained within statistical control. As noted later in the chapter, Six Sigma quality programs do not quite live up to their names. Before addressing that issue, the next section discusses a quality control technique that is widely used in industry: statistical process control. \r\r\rStatistical Process Control \rStatistical process control (SPC) involves the use of various statistical methods to assess and analyze variations in a process. SPC methods include simply keeping records of the production data, histograms, process capability analysis, and control charts. Control charts are the most widely used SPC method, and this section will focus on them. \rThe underlying principle in control charts is that the variations in any process divide into two types: (1) random variations, which are the only variations present if the process is in statistical control, and (2) assignable variations that indicate a departure from statistical control (Section 40.2). It is the objective of a control chart to identify when the process has gone out of statistical control, thus signaling that some corrective action should be taken. \rA control chart is a graphical technique in which statistics computed from measured values of a certain process characteristic are plotted over time to determine if the process remains in statistical control. The general form of the control chart is illustrated in Figure 40.1.

The general form of the control chart is illustrated in Figure 40.1. The chart consists of three horizontal lines that remain constant over time: a center, a lower control limit (LCL), and an upper control limit (UCL). The center is usually set at the nominal design value. The upper and lower control limits are generally set at 3 standard deviations of the sample means. \rIt is highly unlikely that a random sample drawn from the process will lie outside the upper or lower control limits while the process is in statistical control. Thus, if it happens that a sample value does fall outside these limits, it is interpreted to mean that the process is out of control.Therefore,an investigation is undertaken to determine the reason for the out-of-control condition, with appropriate corrective action to eliminate the condition. By similar reasoning, if the process is found to be in statistical control, and there is no evidence of undesirable trends in the data, then no adjustments should be made since they would introduce an assignable variation to the process. The philosophy, \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t \ufb01x it,\u201d is applicable to control charts. \r\r\rThere are two basic types of control charts: (1) control charts for variables and \r(2) control charts for attributes. Control charts for variables require a measurement of the quality characteristic of interest. Control charts for attributes simply require a determination of whether a part is defective or how many defects there are in the sample. \r40.3.1 CONTROL CHARTS FOR VARIABLES \rA process that is out of statistical control manifests this condition in the form of signi\ufb01 cantchanges inprocess meanand/or process variability.Correspondingto thesepossi\r_\r\rbilities, there are two principal types of control charts for variables: x  chart and R chart. \r_\rThe x chart (call it \u201cx bar chart\u201d) is used to plot the average measured value of a certain quality characteristic for each of a series of samples taken from the production process. It indicates how the process mean changes over time. The R chart plots the range of each sample, thus monitoring the variability of the process and indicating whether it changes over time. \rA suitable quality characteristic of the process must be selected as the variable to be monitored on the _ x and R charts. In a mechanical process, this might be a shaft diameter or other critical dimension. Measurements of the process itself must be used to construct the two control charts. \rWith the process operating smoothly and absent of assignable variations, a series of samples (e.g., m \" 20 or more is generally recommended) of small size (e.g., n \" 4, 5, or 6 parts per sample) are collected and the characteristic of interest is measured for each part. The following procedure is used to construct the center, LCL, and UCL for each chart: \r1. Compute the mean _ x and range R for each of the m samples. \r_ \r_\r\r2. \rCompute the grand mean x, which is the mean of the values for the m samples; this will be the center for the _ x chart. \r\r3. \rCompute R, which is the mean of the R values for the m samples; this will be the center for the R chart. \r\r\r\r_\r4.

Examples of these kinds of attributes include number of defects per automobile, fraction of bad parts in a sample, existence or absence of \ufb02ash in plastic moldings, and number of \ufb02aws in a roll of sheet steel. The two principal types of control charts for attributes are the p chart, which plots the fraction defect rate in successive samples; and the c chart, which plots the number of defects, \ufb02aws, or other nonconformities per sample. \rp Chart In the p chart, the quality characteristic of interest is the proportion (p for proportion) of nonconforming or defective units.

For x _ and R \r_\rcharts, the x  and R values of the measured characteristic are plotted on the control chart. By convention, the points are usually connected, as in the \ufb01gures. To interpret the data, one looks for signs that indicate the process is not in statistical control. The \r_\rmost obvious sign is when x  or R (or both) lie outside the LCL or UCL limits. This indicates an assignable cause such as bad starting materials, new operator, broken tooling, or similar factors. An out-of-limit x _ indicates a shift in the process mean. An out-of-limit R shows that the variability of the process has changed. The usual effect is that R increases, indicating variability has risen. Less-obvious conditions may reveal process problems, even though the sample points lie within the 3s limits. These conditions include (1) trends or cyclical patterns in the data, which may mean wear or other factors that occur as a function of time; (2) sudden changes in average level of the data; and (3) points consistently near the upper or lower limits. \r\rThe same kinds of interpretations that apply to the x chart and R chart are also applicable to the p chart and c chart. \r\r\r\rQuality Programs in Manufacturing \rStatistical process control is widely used for monitoring the quality of manufactured parts and products.

Several additional quality programs are also used in industry, and this section brie\ufb02y describes four of them: (1) total quality management, (2) six sigma, (3) Taguchi methods, and (4) ISO 9000. These programs are not alternatives to statistical process control; in fact, the tools used in SPC are included within the methodologies of total quality management and six sigma. \r40.4.1 TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT \rTotal quality management (TQM) is a management approach to quality that pursues three main goals: (1) achieving customer satisfaction, (2) encouraging the involvement of the entire workforce, and (3) continuous improvement. \rThe customer and customer satisfaction are a central focus of TQM, and products are designed and manufactured with this focus in mind. The product must be designed with the features that customers want, and it must be manufactured free of de\ufb01 ciencies. Within the scope of customer satisfaction is the recognition that there are two categories of customers: (1) external customers and (2) internal customers. External customers are those who purchase the company\u2019s products and services. Internal customers are inside the company, such as the company\u2019s \ufb01nal assembly department that is the customer of the parts production departments.For the total organization to be effective and ef\ufb01 cient, satisfaction must be achieved in both categories of customers. \rIn TQM, worker involvement in the quality efforts of the organization extends from the top executives through all levels beneath. There is recognition of the important in\ufb02uence that product design has on product quality and how decisions made during design affect the quality that can be achieved in manufacturing. In addition, production workers are made responsible for the quality of their own output, rather than rely on inspectors to uncover defects after the parts are already produced. TQM training, including use of the tools of statistical process control, is provided to all workers. The pursuit of high quality is embraced by every member of the organization. \rThe third goal of TQM is continuous improvement; that is, adopting the attitude that it is always possible to make something better, whether it is a product or a process. Continuous improvement in an organization is generally implemented using worker teams that have been organized to solve speci\ufb01c problems that are identi\ufb01ed in production. The problems are not limited to quality issues. They may include productivity, cost, safety, or any other area of interest to the organization. Team members are selected on the basis of their knowledge and expertise in the problem area. They are drawn from various departments and serve part-time on the team, meeting several times per month until they are able to make recommendations and/or solve the problem. Then the team is disbanded. \r\r40.4.2 SIX SIGMA \rThe Six Sigma quality program originated and was \ufb01rst used at Motorola Corporation in the 1980s. It has been adopted by many other companies in the United States and was brie\ufb02y discussed in Section 1.6 as one of the recent developments in manufacturing. Six Sigma is quite similar to total quality management in its emphasis on management involvement, worker teams to solve speci\ufb01 c problems, and the use of SPC tools such as control charts.The major difference between Six Sigma and TQM is that Six Sigma establishes measurable targets for quality based on the number of standard deviations (sigma s) away from the mean in the normal distribution.

A project requires the Six Sigma team to (1) de\ufb01ne the problem, (2) measure the process and assess current performance, (3) analyze the process, (4) recommend improvements, and (5) develop a control plan to implement and sustain the improvements. The responsibility of management in Six Sigma is to identify important problems in their operations and sponsor the teams to address those problems. \rStatistical Basis of Six Sigma An underlying assumption in Six Sigma is that the defects in any process can be measured and quanti\ufb01ed. Once quanti\ufb01ed, the causes of the defects can be identi\ufb01ed, and improvements can be made to eliminate or reduce the defects.The effects of any improvements can be assessed using the same measurements in a before-and-after comparison. The comparison is often summarized as a sigma level; for example, the process is now operating at the 4.8-Sigma level whereas before it was only operating at the 2.6-Sigma level. The relationship between sigma level and defects per million (DPM) is listed in Table 40.3 for a Six Sigma program. Accordingly, the DPM was previously at 135,666 defects per 1,000,000 in this example, whereas it has now been reduced to 483 DPM. \rTABLE \u2022 40.3 Sigma Levels and Corresponding Defects Per Million in a Six SigmaProgram. \r\r\rA traditional measure for good process quality is 3s (three sigma level). It implies that the process is stable and in statistical control, and the variable represen ting the output of the process is normally distributed. Under these conditions, 99.73% of the output will be within the 3s range, and 0.27% or 2700 parts per million will lie outside these limits (0.135% or 1350 parts per million beyond the upper limit and the same number beyond the lower limit). But wait a minute, if one looks up 3.0 sigma in Table 40.3, there are 66,807 defects per million. Why is there a difference between the standard normal distribution value (2700 DPM) and the value given in Table 40.3 (66,807 DPM)? There are two reasons for this discrepancy. First, the values in Table 40.3 refer to only one tail of the distribution, so that an appropriate comparison with the standard normal tables would only use one tail of the distribution (1350 DPM). Second, and much more signi\ufb01 cant, is that when Motorola devised the Six Sigma program, they considered the operation of processes over long periods of time, and processes over long periods tend to experience shifts from their original process means. To compensate for these shifts, Motorola decided to adjust the standard normal values by 1.5s. To summarize, Table 40.3 includes only one tail of the normal distribution, and it shifts the distribution by 1.5 sigma relative to the standard normal distribution. These effects can be seen in Figure 40.3. \rMeasuring the Sigma Level In a Six Sigma project, the performance level of the process of interest is reduced to a sigma level. This is done at two points during the project: (1) after measurements have been taken of the process as it is currently operating and (2) after process improvements have been made to assess the effect of the improvements. This provides a before-and-after comparison. High sigma values represent good performance; low sigma values mean poor performance. \rTo \ufb01nd the sigma level, the number of defects per million must \ufb01rst be determined.

Defective products (or their components) that are exposed before shipment are not considered part of this loss. Instead, any expense to the company resulting from scrap or rework of defective product is a manufacturing cost rather than a quality loss. \rLoss occurs when a product\u2019s functional characteristic differs from its nominal or target value. Although functional characteristics do not translate directly into dimensional features, the loss relationship is most readily understood in terms of dimensions. When the dimension of a component deviates from its nominal value,the component\u2019s function is adversely affected. No matter how small the deviation, there is some loss in function.The loss increases at an accelerating rate as the deviation grows,according to Taguchi. Let x  the quality characteristic of interest and N  its nominal value, then the loss function is a U-shaped curve as in Figure 40.4(a).A quadratic equation can be used to describe this curve: \rL(x) \" k(x # N)2 (40.13) \r\rwhere L(x) \" loss function; k \" constant of proportionality; and x and N are de\ufb01ned above. At some level of deviation (x2 # N) (x1 # N), the loss will be prohibitive, and it is necessary to scrap or rework the product. This level identi\ufb01es one possible way of specifying the tolerance limit for the dimension. \rIn the traditional approach to quality control, tolerance limits are de\ufb01ned and any product within those limits is acceptable.Whether the quality characteristic (e.g.,the dimension) is close to the nominal value or close to one of the tolerance limits, it is acceptable. Trying to visualize this approach in terms analogous to the preceding relation, the discontinuous loss function in Figure 40.4(b) is obtained.

(b) Using the loss function constant determined in (a), what would be the value of the loss function if the company could maintain a tolerance of 0.01 cm instead of 0.04 cm? \rSolution: In Equation (40.13), the value of (x # N) is the tolerance 0.04 cm.

Three types of noise factors can be distinguished: (1) unit-to-unit, (2) internal, and \r(3) external. \rUnit-to-unit noise factors consist of inherent random variations in the process or product caused by variability in raw materials, machinery, and human participation. These are noise factors that were previously called random variations in the process. They are associated with a production process that is in statistical control. \rInternal noise factors are sources of variation that are internal to the product or process.They include time-dependent factors such as wear of mechanical components, spoilage of raw materials, and fatigue of metal parts; and operational errors, such as improper settings on the product or machine tool.An external noise factor is a source of variation that is external to the product or process, such as outside temperature, humidity, raw material supply, and input voltage. Internal and external noise factors constitute what were previously called assignable variations. \r\rA robust design is one in which the product\u2019s function and performance are relatively insensitive to variations in design and manufacturing parameters. It involves the design of both the product and process so that the manufactured product will be relatively unaffected by all noise factors. An example of a robust product design is an automobile whose ignition starter works as well in Minneapolis, Minnesota in winter as in Meridian,Mississippi in summer.An example of robust process design is a metal extrusion operation that produces good product despite temperature variations in the starting billet. \r\r40.4.4 ISO 9000 \r\rISO 9000 is a set of international standards that relate to the quality of the products (and services, if applicable) delivered by a given facility. The standards were developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), based in Geneva, Switzerland. ISO 9000 establishes standards for the systems and procedures used by the facility that determine the quality of its products. ISO 9000 is not a standard for the products themselves. Its focus is on systems and procedures, which include the facility\u2019s organizational structure, responsibilities, methods, and resources needed to manage quality. ISO 9000 is concerned with the activities used by the facility to ensure that its products achieve customer satisfaction. \rISO 9000 can be implemented in two ways, formally and informally. Formal implementation means that the facility becomes registered, which certi\ufb01 es that the facility meets the requirements of the standard.Registration is obtained through a third-party agency that conducts on-site inspections and reviews the facility\u2019s quality systems and procedures. A bene\ufb01t of registration is that it quali\ufb01 es the facility to do business with companies that require ISO 9000 registration, which is common in the European Economic Community where certain products are regulated and ISO 9000 registration is required for companies making these products. \rInformal implementation of ISO 9000 means that the facility practices the standards or portions thereof simply to improve its quality systems. Such improvements are worthwhile, even without formal certi\ufb01cation, for companies desiring to deliver high quality products. \r\r\rInspection Principles \rInspection involves the use of measurement and gaging techniques to determine whether a product, its components, subassemblies, or starting materials conform to design speci\ufb01cations.

Does the product operate the way it is supposed to operate? Will it continue to operate for a reasonable period of time? Will it operate in environments of extreme temperature and humidity? In quality control, testing is a procedure in which the product, subassembly, part, or material is observed under conditions that might be encountered during service. For example, a product might be tested by operating it for a certain period of time to determine whether it functions properly. If it passes the test, it is approved for shipment to the customer. \rTesting of a component or material is sometimes damaging or destructive. In these cases, the items must be tested on a sampling basis. The expense of destructive testing is signi\ufb01 cant, and great efforts are made to develop methods that do not destroy the item. These methods are referred to as nondestructive testing or nondestructive evaluation. \rInspections divide into two types: (1) inspection by variables, in which the product or part dimensions of interest are measured by the appropriate measuring instruments; and (2) inspection by attributes, in which the parts are gaged to determine whether they are within tolerance limits. The advantage of measuring a part dimension is that data are obtained about its actual value. The data might be recorded over time and used to analyze trends in the manufacturing process. Adjustments in the process can be made based on the data so that future parts are produced closer to the nominal design value. When a part dimension is simply gaged, all that is known is whether it is within tolerance or too big or too small. On the positive side, gaging can be done quickly and at low cost. \r\r40.5.1 MANUAL AND AUTOMATED INSPECTION \rInspection procedures are often performed manually. The work is usually boring and monotonous, yet the need for precision and accuracy is high. Hours are sometimes required to measure the important dimensions of only one part. Because of the time and cost of manual inspection, statistical sampling procedures are generally used to reduce the need to inspect every part. \rSampling versus 100% Inspection When sampling inspection is used, the number of parts in the sample is generally small compared to the quantity of parts produced.The sample size may be only 1% of the production run.Because not all of the items in the population are measured, there is a risk in any sampling procedure that defective parts will slip through. One of the goals in statistical sampling is to de\ufb01ne the expected risk; that is, to determine the average defect rate that will pass through the sampling procedure. The risk can be reduced by increasing the sample size and the frequency with which samples are collected. But the fact remains that 100% good quality cannot be guaranteed in a sampling inspection procedure. \rTheoretically, the only way to achieve 100% good quality is by 100% inspection; thus, all defects are screened and only good parts pass through the inspection procedure. However, when 100% inspection is done manually, two problems are encountered. The \ufb01rst is the expense involved. Instead of dividing the cost of inspecting the sample over the number of parts in the production run, the unit inspection cost is applied to every part in the batch. Inspection cost sometimes exceeds the cost of making the part. Second, in 100% manual inspection, there are almost always errors associated with the procedure. The error rate depends on the complexity and dif\ufb01culty of the inspection task and how much judgment is required by the human inspector. These factors are compounded by operator fatigue. Errors mean that a certain number of poor quality parts will be accepted and a certain number of good quality parts will be rejected.

Therefore, 100% inspection using manual methods is no guarantee of 100% good quality product. \r\rAutomated 100% Inspection Automation of the inspection process offers a possible way to overcome the problems associated with 100% manual inspection. Automated inspection is de\ufb01ned as automation of one or more steps in the inspection procedure, such as (1) automated presentation of parts by an automated handling system, with a human operator still performing the actual inspection process (e.g., visually examining parts for \ufb02aws); (2) manual loading of parts into an automatic inspection machine; and (3) fully automated inspection cell in which parts are both presented and inspected automatically. Inspection automation can also include (4) computerized data collection from electronic measuring instruments. \rAutomated 100% inspection can be integrated with the manufacturing process to accomplish some action relative to the process. The actions can be one or both of the following: (1) parts sortation, and/or (2) feedback of data to the process. Parts sortation means separating parts into two or more quality levels.The basic sortation includes two levels: acceptable and unacceptable. Some situations require more than two levels, such as acceptable, reworkable, and scrap. Sortation and inspection may be combined in the same station. An alternative approach is to locate one or more inspections along the processing line, and instructions are sent to a sortation station at the end of the line indicating what action is required for each part. \rFeedback of inspection data to the upstream manufacturing operation allows compensating adjustments to be made in the process to reduce variability and improve quality. If inspection measurements indicate that the output is drifting toward one of the tolerance limits (e.g., due to tool wear), corrections can be made to process parameters to move the output toward the nominal value. The output is thereby maintained within a smaller variability range than possible with sampling inspection methods. \r\r40.5.2 CONTACT VERSUS NONCONTACT INSPECTION \rThere are a variety of measurement and gaging technologies available for inspec tion. The possibilities can be divided into contact and noncontact inspection methods. Contact inspection involves the use of a mechanical probe or other device that makes contact with the object being inspected. By its nature, contact inspection is usually concerned with measuring or gaging some physical dimension of the part. It is accomplished manually or automatically. Most of the traditional measuring and gaging devices described in Chapter 5 relate to contact inspection.An example of an automated contact measuring system is the coordinate measuring machine (Section 40.6.1). \rNoncontact inspection methods utilize a sensor located a certain distance from the object to measure or gage the desired feature(s). Typical advantages of noncontact inspection are (1) faster inspection cycles, and (2) avoidance of damage to the part that might result from contact. Noncontact methods can often be accomplished on the production line without any special handling. By contrast, contact inspection usually requires special positioning of the part, necessitating its removal from the production line.Also,noncontact inspection methods are inherently faster because they employ a stationary probe that does not require positioning for every part. By contrast, contact inspection requires positioning of the contact probe against the part, which takes time. \rNoncontact inspection technologies can be classi\ufb01ed as optical or nonoptical. Prominent among the optical methods are lasers (Section 40.6.2) and machine vision (Section 40.6.3). Nonoptical inspection sensors include electrical \ufb01eld techniques, radiation techniques, and ultrasonics (Section 40.6.4). \r\r\r\r\rModern Inspection Technologies \rAdvanced technologies are substituting for manual measuring and gaging techniques in modern manufacturing plants.

They include contact and noncontact sensing methods. The coverage begins with an important contact inspection technology: coordinate measuring machines. \r\r40.6.1 COORDINATE MEASURING MACHINES \rA coordinate measuring machine (CMM) consists of a contact probe and a mechanism to position the probe in three dimensions relative to surfaces and features of a work part.See Figure 40.5.The location coordinates of the probe can be accurately recorded as it contacts the part surface to obtain part geometry data. \rIn a CMM, the probe is fastened to a structure that allows movement of the probe relative to the part, which is \ufb01xtured on a worktable connected to the structure. The structure must be rigid to minimize de\ufb02ections that contribute to measurement errors. The machine in Figure 40.5 has a bridge structure, one of the most common designs. Special features are used in CMM structures to build high accuracy and precision into the measuring machine, including use of low-friction air-bearings and mechanical isolation of the CMM to reduce vibrations.An important aspect in a CMM is the contact probe and its operation. Modern \u201ctouch-trigger\u201d probes have a sensitive electrical contact that emits a signal when the probe is de\ufb02ected from its neutral position in the slightest amount. On contact, the coordinate positions are recorded by the CMM controller, adjusting for overtravel and probe size. \rPositioning of the probe relative to the part can be accomplished either manually or under computer control. Methods of operating a CMM can be classi\ufb01ed as (1) manual control, (2) manual computer-assisted, (3) motorized computer-assisted, and (4) direct computer control. \rIn manual control, a human operator physically moves the probe along the axes to contact the part and record the measurements.The probe is free-\ufb02oating for easy movement. Measurements are indicated by digital read-out, and the operator can record the measurement manually or automatically (paper print-out).Any trigonometric calculations must be made by the operator. The manual computer-assisted CMM is capable of computer data processing to perform these calculations. Types of computations include simple conversions from U.S. customary units to SI, determining the angle between two planes, and determining hole-center locations. The probe is still free-\ufb02oating to permit the operator to bring it into contact with part surfaces. \rMotorized computer-assisted CMMs power drive the probe along the machine axes under operator guidance. A joystick or similar device is used to control the motion. Low-power stepping motors and friction clutches are used to reduce the effects of collisions between probe and part. The direct computer-control CMM operates like \r\r\rFIGURE 40.5 \rCoordinate measuringmachine. (Courtesy ofHexagon Metrology.) \ra CNC machine tool. It is a computerized inspection machine that operates under program control. The basic capability of a CMM is to determine coordinate values where its probe contacts the surface of a part. Computer control permits the CMM to accomplish more sophisticated measurements and inspections, such as (1) determining center location of a hole or cylinder, (2) de\ufb01nition of a plane, (3) measurement of \ufb02atness of a surface or parallelism between two surfaces, and (4) measurement of an angle between two planes. \rAdvantages of using coordinate measuring machines over manual inspection methods include (1) higher productivity\u2014a CMM can perform complex inspection procedures in much less time than traditional manual methods; (2) greater inherent accuracy and precision than conventional methods; and (3) reduced human error through automation of the inspection procedure and associated computations [8].

Applications of lasers include cutting (Section 25.3.3) and welding (Section 29.4). These applications involve the use of solid-state lasers capable of focusing suf\ufb01cient power to melt or sublimate the work material. Lasers for measurement applications are low-power gas lasers such as helium-neon, which emits light in the visible range. The light beam from a laser is (1) highly monochromatic, which means the light has a single wave length, and (2) highly collimated, which means the light rays are parallel. These properties have motivated a growing list of laser applications in measurement and inspection. Two are described here. \rScanning Laser Systems The scanning laser uses a laser beam de\ufb02ected by a rotating mirror to produce a beam of light that sweeps past an object, as in Figure 40.6. A photodetector on the far side of the object senses the light beam during its sweep except for the short time when it is interrupted by the object. This time period can be measured quickly with great accuracy. A microprocessor system measures the time interruption that is related to the size of the object in the path of the laser beam, and converts the time to a linear dimension. Scanning laser beams can be applied in high production on-line inspection and gaging. Signals can be sent to production equipment to make adjustments in the process and/or activate a sortation device on the production line.Applications of scanning laser systems include rolling-mill operations, wire extrusion, machining, and grinding. \rLaser Triangulation Triangulation is used to determine the distance of an object from two known locations by means of trigonometric relationships of a right triangle. The principle can be applied in dimensional measurements using a laser system, as in Figure 40.7.The laser beam is focused on an object to form a light spot on the surface. A position-sensitive optical detector is used to determine the location of the spot.The angle A of the beam directed at the object and the distance H are \ufb01 xed and known. \r\rFIGURE 40.6 Scanning laser system for measuring diameter of cylindrical work part; time of interruption of light beam is proportional to diameter D. \r\r\rGiven that the photodetector is located a \ufb01 xed distance above the worktable, the part depth D in the setup of Figure 40.7 is determined from\r D \" H # R \" H # L cot A (40.14) where L is determined by the position of the light spot on the work part. \r\r40.6.3 MACHINE VISION \rMachine vision involves the acquisition, processing, and interpretation of image data by computer for some useful application. Vision systems can be classi\ufb01ed as two dimensional or three dimensional.Two-dimensional systems view the scene as a 2-D image, which is quite adequate for applications involving a planar object.

The majority of current applications are 2-D, and the discussion will focus (excuse the pun) on this technology. \rOperation of Machine Vision Systems Operation of a machine vision system consists of three steps, depicted in Figure 40.8: (1) Image acquisition and digitization, \r(2) image processing and analysis, and (3) interpretation. \rImage acquisition and digitizing is accomplished by a video camera connected to a digitizing system to store the image data for subsequent processing. With the camera focused on the subject, an image is obtained by dividing the viewing area into a matrix of discrete picture elements (called pixels), in which each element assumes a value proportional to the light intensity of that portion of the scene. The intensity value for each pixel is converted to its equivalent digital value by analog-to-digital conversion. Image acquisition and digitizing is depicted in Figure 40.9 for a binary vision system, in which the light intensity is reduced to either of two values (black or white  0 or 1), as in Table 40.4.The pixel matrix in the illustration is only 12 % 12; a real vision system would have many more pixels for better resolution. Each set of pixel values is a frame, which consists of the set of digitized pixel values. The frame is stored in computer memory. The process of reading all the pixel values in a frame is performed 30 times per second in United States, 25 cycle/s in European systems. \rFIGURE 40.8 \rOperation of a machinevision system. \rFIGURE 40.9 \rImage acquisition anddigitizing: (a) the sceneconsists of a dark-colored part against alight background; (b) a12  12 matrix of pixelsimposed on the scene. \r\rThe resolution of a vision system is its ability to sense \ufb01 ne details and features in the image.This depends on the number of pixels used.Common pixel arrays include 640 (horizontal)  480 (vertical), 1024  768, or 1040  1392 picture elements. The more pixels in the vision system, the higher its resolution. However, system cost increases as pixel count increases. Also, time required to read the picture elements and process the data increases with number of pixels. In addition to binary vision systems, more sophisticated vision systems distinguish various gray levels in the image that permit them to determine surface characteristics such as texture. Called gray-scale vision, these systems typically use four, six, or eight bits of memory. Other vision systems can recognize colors. \rThe second function in machine vision is image processing and analysis. The data for each frame must be analyzed within the time required to complete one scan (1/30 s or 1/25 s). Several techniques have been developed to analyze image data, including edge detection and feature extraction. Edge detection involves determining the locations of boundaries between an object and its surroundings. This is accomplished by identifying contrast in light intensity between adjacent pixels at the borders of the object. Feature extraction is concerned with determining feature values of an image. \r\r\r\rMany machine vision systems identify an object in the image by means of its features. Features of an object include area, length, width, or diameter of the object, perimeter, center of gravity, and aspect ratio. Feature extraction algorithms are designed to deter mine these features based on the object\u2019s area and boundaries. Area of an object can be determined by counting the number of pixels that make up the object. Length can be found by measuring the distance (in pixels) between two opposite edges of the part. \rInterpretation of the image is the third function. It is accomplished by extracted features. Interpretation is usually concerned with recognizing the object\u2014identifying the object in the image by comparing it to prede\ufb01ned models or standard values. One common interpretation technique is template matching, which refers to methods that compare one or more features of an image with corresponding features of a model (template) stored in computer memory. \rMachine Vision Applications The interpretation function in machine vision is generally related to applications, which divide into four categories: (1) inspection, \r(2)\r part identi\ufb01cation, (3) visual guidance and control, and (4) safety monitoring. \r\rInspection is the most important category, accounting for about 90% of all industrial applications.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 54016, "end_char_idx": 58682, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6287c80-bd7f-4de7-85b8-e244a28fca7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6287c80-bd7f-4de7-85b8-e244a28fca7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec40.txt", "file_name": "sec40.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 63482, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a4023a0-0ef8-430f-b39b-b0c3fec8172b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec40.txt", "file_name": "sec40.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 63482, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "0fb480b5a647e6a8f45156c21ddc3ccb8aaccdc795d6ab014a462b2bb102a648", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9fa49fed-04a8-41b2-ad2e-b1aa898aa8c1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec40.txt", "file_name": "sec40.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 63482, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "8c0312dec7c2f486a95f78e825fc170c63a5e86fb1d1670e05d92fae9d6affca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "68aae833-5395-4d40-9b1f-fbbfe9a78919", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b61bf163e1f2bb09e2fe576b0e44ed4c19cd87f34b33d09ee02547561079d3d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Length can be found by measuring the distance (in pixels) between two opposite edges of the part. \rInterpretation of the image is the third function.

The applications are in mass production, where the time to program and install the system can be divided by many thousands of units. Typical inspection tasks include: (1) dimensional measurement or gaging, which involves measuring or gaging certain dimensions of parts or products moving along a conveyor; (2) veri\ufb01 cation functions, which include verifying presence of components in an assembled product, presence of a hole in a work part, and similar tasks; and \r\r(3) \ridenti\ufb01 cation of \ufb02 aws and defects, such as identifying \ufb02 aws in a printed label in the form of mislocation, poorly printed text, numbering, or graphics on the label. \r\r\rPart identi\ufb01 cation applications include counting different parts \ufb02owing past on a conveyor, part sorting, and character recognition. Visual guidance and control involves a vision system interfaced with a robot or similar machine to control the movement of the machine. Examples include seam tracking in continuous arc welding, part positioning, part reorientation, and picking parts from a bin. In safety monitoring applications, the vision system monitors the production operation to detect irregularities that might indicate a hazardous condition to equipment or humans. \r\r40.6.4 OTHER NONCONTACT INSPECTION TECHNIQUES \rIn addition to optical inspection methods, there are various nonoptical techniques used in inspection. These include sensor techniques based on electrical \ufb01elds, radiation, and ultrasonics. \rUnder certain conditions, electrical \ufb01 elds created by an electrical probe can be used for inspection. The \ufb01 elds include reluctance, capacitance, and inductance; they are affected by an object in the vicinity of the probe. In a typical application, the work part is positioned in a \ufb01 xed relationship to the probe. By measuring the effect of the object on the electrical \ufb01 eld, an indirect measurement of certain part characteristics can be made, such as dimensional features, thickness of sheet material, and \ufb02 aws (cracks and voids below the surface) in the material. \rRadiation techniques use X-ray radiation to inspect metals and weldments. The amount of radiation absorbed by the metal object indicates thickness and presence of \ufb02 aws in the part or welded section. For example, X-ray inspection is used to measure thickness of sheet metal in rolling (Section 18.1). Data from the inspection is used to adjust the gap between rolls in the rolling mill. \rUltrasonic techniques use high-frequency sound (> 20,000 Hz) to perform various inspection tasks. One of the techniques analyses the ultrasonic waves emitted by a probe and re\ufb02ected off the object. During the setup for the inspection procedure, an ideal test part is positioned in front of the probe to obtain a re\ufb02 ected sound pattern. This sound pattern is used as the standard against which production parts are subsequently compared. If the re\ufb02ected pattern from a given part matches the standard, the part is accepted. If a match is not obtained, the part is rejected. \r\r\r [1] DeFeo, J. A., Gryna, F. M., and Chua, R. C. H. Juran\u2019s Quality Planning and Analysis for Enterprise Quality, 5th ed.

Polymers form the living organisms and vital processes of alllife on earth.To ancientman,biological polymerswere the source of food, shelter, and many of his implements. However, the focus in this chapter is on polymers other than biological. With the exception of natural rubber, nearly all of the polymeric materials used in engineering today are synthetic. The materials themselves are made by chemical processing, and most of the products are made by solidi\ufb01 cation processes. \rA polymer is a compound consisting of long-chain molecules, each molecule made up of repeating units connected together. There may be thousands, even millions of units in a single polymer molecule. The word is derived from the Greek words poly, meaning many, and meros (reduced to mer), meaning part. Most polymers are based on carbon and are therefore considered organic chemicals. \rPolymers can be separated into plastics and rubbers. As engineering materials, they are relatively new compared to metals and ceramics, dating only from around the mid\u20131800s (Historical Note 8.1). For the purpose of covering polymers as a technical subject, it is appropriate to divide them into three categories, where (1) and \r(2) are plastics and (3) is the rubber category: \r1. \rThermoplastic polymers, also called thermoplastics (TP), are solid materials at room temperature, but they become viscous liquids when heated to tempera tures of only a few hundred degrees. This characteristic allows them to be easily and economically shaped into products. They can be subjected to this heating and cooling cycle repeatedly without signi\ufb01cant degradation of the polymer. \r\r2. \rThermosetting polymers, or thermosets (TS), cannot tolerate repeated heating cycles as thermoplastics can. When initially heated, they soften and \ufb02ow for molding, but the elevated temperatures also produce a chemical reaction that hardens the \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rHistorical Note 8.1 History of polymers \rCertainly one of the milestones in the history of polymers was Charles Goodyear\u2019s discovery of vulcanization of rubber in 1839 (Historical Note 8.2). In 1851, his brother Nelson patented hard rubber, called ebonite, which in reality is a thermosetting polymer. It was used for many years for combs, battery cases, and dental prostheses. \rAt the 1862 International Exhibition in London, an English chemist Alexander Parkes demonstrated the possibilities of the \ufb01rst thermoplastic, a form of cellulose nitrate (cellulose is a natural polymer in wood and cotton).

He called it Parkesine and described it as a replacement for ivory and tortoiseshell. The material became commercially important due to the efforts of American John W. Hyatt, Jr., who combined cellulose nitrate and camphor (which acts as a plasticizer) together with heat and pressure to form the product he called Celluloid. His patent was issued in 1870. Celluloid plastic was transparent, and the applications subsequently developed for it included photographic and motion picture \ufb01lm and windshields for carriages and early motorcars. \rSeveral additional products based on cellulose were developed around the turn of the last century. Cellulose \ufb01 bers, called Rayon, were \ufb01rst produced around 1890. Packaging \ufb01lm, called Cellophane, was \ufb01rst marketed around 1910. Cellulose acetate was adopted as the base for photographic \ufb01lm around the same time. This material was to become an important thermoplastic for injection molding during the next several decades. \rThe \ufb01rst synthetic plastic was developed in the early 1900s by the Belgian-born American chemist L. H. Baekeland. It involved the reaction and polymerization of phenol and formaldehyde to form what its inventor called Bakelite. This thermosetting resin is still commercially important today. It was followed by other similar polymers: urea-formaldehyde in 1918 and melamine-formaldehyde in 1939. \rThe late 1920s and 1930s saw the development of a number of thermoplastics of major importance today. A Russian I. Ostromislensky had patented polyvinylchloride in 1912, but it was \ufb01rst commercialized in 1927 as a wall covering. Around the same time, polystyrene was \ufb01 rst produced in Germany. In England, fundamental research was started in 1932 that led to the synthesis of polyethylene; the \ufb01rst production plant came on line just before the outbreak ofWorldWar II.This was low density polyethylene. Finally, a major research program initiated in 1928 under the direction of W. Carothers at DuPont in the United States led to the synthesis of the polyamide nylon; it was commercialized in the late 1930s. Its initial use was in ladies\u2019 hosiery; subsequent applications during the war included low friction bearings and wire insulation. Similar efforts in Germany provided an alternative form of nylon in 1939. \rSeveral important special-purpose polymers were developed in the 1940s: \ufb02 uorocarbons (Te\ufb02 on), silicones, and polyurethanes in 1943; epoxy resins in 1947, and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS) in 1948. During the 1950s: polyester \ufb01 bers in 1950; and polypropylene, polycarbonate, and high-density polyethylene in 1957. Thermoplastic elastomers were \ufb01 rst developed in the 1960s.The ensuing years have witnessed a tremendous growth in the use of plastics. \r\r\rmaterial into an infusible solid.

They are very compatible with net shape processing. \r\r\u27a2 \rPlastics possess an attractive list of properties for many engineering applications where strength is not a factor: (1) low density relative to metals and ceramics; (2) good strength-to-weight ratios for certain (but not all) polymers;(3) high corrosion resistance; and (4) low electrical and thermal conductivity. \r\r\u27a2 \rOn a volumetric basis, polymers are cost competitive with metals. \r\r\u27a2 \rOn a volumetric basis, polymers generally require less energy to produce than metals.This is generally true because the temperatures for working these materials are much lower than for metals. \r\r\u27a2 \rCertain plastics are translucent and/or transparent, which makes them competitive with glass in some applications. \r\r\u27a2 \rPolymers are widely used in composite materials (Chapter 9). \r\r\rOn the negative side,polymers in general have the following limitations:(1) strength is low relative to metals and ceramics; (2) modulus of elasticity or stiffness is also low\u2014 in the case of elastomers, of course, this may be a desirable characteristic; (3) service temperatures are limited to only a few hundred degrees because of the softening of thermoplastic polymers or degradation of thermosetting polymers and elastomers; \r(4) some polymers degrade when subjected to sunlight and other forms of radiation; and (5) plastics exhibit viscoelastic properties (Section 3.5), which can be a distinct limitation in load bearing applications. \rThis chapter examines the technology of polymeric materials.

The small units, called monomers, are generally simple unsaturated organic molecules such as ethylene C2H4. The atoms in these molecules are held together by covalent bonds; and when joined to form the polymer, the same covalent bonding holds the links of the chain together. Thus, each large molecule is characterized by strong primary bonding.

Entanglement among the long strands helps to hold the mass together, but atomic bonding is more signi\ufb01 cant. The bonding between macromolecules in the mass is due to van der Waals and other secondary bonding types.Thus,the aggregate polymer material is held together by forces that are substantially weaker than the primary bonds holding the molecules together. This explains why plastics in general are not nearly as stiff and strong as metals or ceramics. \rWhen a thermoplastic polymer is heated, it softens. The heat energy causes the macromolecules to become thermally agitated, exciting them to move relative to each other within the polymer mass (here, the wet spaghetti analogy loses its appeal). The material begins to behave like a viscous liquid, viscosity decreasing (\ufb02uidity increasing) with rising temperature. \rThe following discussion will expand on these opening remarks, tracing how poly\rmers are synthesized and examining the characteristics of the materials that result \rfrom the synthesis. \r\r8.1.1 POLYMERIZATION \rAs a chemical process, the synthesis of polymers can occur by either of two methods: \r(1) addition polymerization and (2) step polymerization. Production of a given polymer is generally associated with one method or the other. \rAddition Polymerization In this process, exempli\ufb01 ed by polyethylene, the double bonds between carbon atoms in the ethylene monomers are induced to open so that they join with other monomer molecules. The connections occur on both ends of the expanding macromolecule, developing long chains of repeating mers. Because of the way the molecules are formed, the process is also known as chain polymerization. It is initiated using a chemical catalyst (called an initiator) to open the carbon double bond in some of the monomers. These monomers, which are now highly reactive because of their unpaired electrons, then capture other monomers to begin forming chains that are reactive. The chains propagate by capturing still other monomers, one at a time, until large molecules have been produced and the reaction is terminated. The process proceeds as indicated in Figure 8.2. The entire polymerization reaction takes only seconds for any given macromolecule. However, in the industrial process, it may take many minutes or even hours to complete \r\rFIGURE 8.2 Model of addition (chain) polymerization: (1) initiation, \r(2) rapid addition of monomers, and (3) resulting long-chain polymer molecule with n mers at termination of reaction. \rFIGURE 8.3 Some typical polymers formed by addition (chain)polymerization.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 9379, "end_char_idx": 13483, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94e078c1-cf65-4b00-9b2f-d8cfb84e110f": {"__data__": {"id_": "94e078c1-cf65-4b00-9b2f-d8cfb84e110f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ab637be5-b587-4f0b-851a-438c01bdf65a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "e244bbb9ca0d5ff001b05122fbc1ca7b4f466e290ba4e6a82dc46c0532acd61e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6f83633e-109e-4d95-8b7a-44148c4fe4bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "c68a4a62cf24172db478004b6d9dfaf434a42e4b0655494bc25367c39754f3de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bf19c383-f66b-4fe9-b8d8-eecc2d318837", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a9985aed8f88429367bad0fb5e36fe270aca1fb4cec0040e5300badba1d0d3b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These monomers, which are now highly reactive because of their unpaired electrons, then capture other monomers to begin forming chains that are reactive.

Only after suf\ufb01cient time has elapsed are molecules of adequate length formed. \rIt should be noted that water is not always the byproduct of the reaction; for example, ammonia (NH3) is another simple compound produced in some reactions. Nevertheless, the term condensation polymerization is still used. It should also be noted that although most step polymerization processes involve condensation of a byproduct, some do not. Examples of commercial polymers produced by step (condensation) polymerization are given in Figure 8.5. Both thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers are synthesized by this method; nylon-6,6 and polycarbonate are TP polymers, while phenol formaldehyde and urea formaldehyde are TS polymers. \rDegree of Polymerization and Molecular Weight A macromolecule produced by polymerization consists of n repeating mers. Since molecules in a given batch of polymerized material vary in length, n for the batch is an average; its statistical distribution is normal. The mean value of n is called the degree of polymerization (DP) for the batch. The degree of polymerization affects the properties of the polymer: higher DP increases mechanical strength but also increases viscosity in the \ufb02uid state, which makes processing more dif\ufb01cult. \rThe molecular weight (MW) of a polymer is the sum of the molecular weights of the mers in the molecule; it is n times the molecular weight of each repeating unit. Since n varies for different molecules in a batch, the molecule weight must be interpreted as an average.

It also in\ufb02uences the tendency of a polymer to crystallize (Section 8.1.3).Continuing with the polypropylene example, this polymer can be synthesized in any of the three tactic structures. In its isotactic form, it is strong and melts at 175\u00b0C (347\u00b0F); the syndiotactic structure is also strong, but melts at 131\u00b0C (268\u00b0F); but atactic polypropylene is soft and melts at around 75\u00b0C (165\u00b0F) and has little commercial use [6], [9]. \rLinear, Branched, and Cross-Linked Polymers The polymerization process has been described as yielding macromolecules of a chain-like structure, called a linear polymer. This is the characteristic structure of a thermoplastic polymer. Other structures are possible, as portrayed in Figure 8.7. One possibility is for side branches to form along the chain, resulting in the branched polymer shown in Figure 8.7(b).

It is the basis of the difference between the three categories of polymers: TP, TS, and E. Thermoplastic polymers always possess linear or branched structures, or a mixture of the two. Branching increases entanglement among the molecules, usually making the polymer stronger in the solid state and more viscous at a given temperature in the plastic or liquid state. \rThermosetting plastics and elastomers are cross-linked polymers. Cross-linking causes the polymer to become chemically set; the reaction cannot be reversed. \r\r\r(a) (b) \r\r(c) (d) \rFIGURE 8.7 Various structures of polymer molecules: (a) linear, characteristic of thermoplastics; (b) branched; (c) loosely cross-linked as in an elastomer; and (d) tightly cross-linked or networked structure as in a thermoset. \rThe effect is to permanently change the structure of the polymer; upon heating, it degrades or burns rather than melts. Thermosets possess a high degree of cross-linking, while elastomers possess a low degree of cross-linking. Thermosets are hard and brittle, while elastomers are elastic and resilient. \rCopolymers Polyethylene is a homopolymer; so are polypropylene, polystyrene, and many other common plastics; their molecules consist of repeating mers that are all the same type. Copolymers are polymers whose molecules are made of repeating units of two different types.An example is the copolymer synthesized from ethylene and propylene to produce a copolymer with elastomeric properties. The ethylene-propylene copolymer can be represented as follows: \r\u2014(C2H4)n (C3H6)m \u2014 \r\rwhere n and m range between 10 and 20,and the proportions of the two constituents are around 50% each. For example, the combination of polyethylene and polypropylene with small amounts of diene is an important synthetic rubber (Section 8.4.3). \rCopolymers can possess different arrangements of their constituent mers. The possibilities are shown in Figure 8.8: (a) alternating copolymer, in which the mers repeat every other place; (b) random, in which the mers are in random order, the frequency depending on the relative proportions of the starting monomers; (c) block, in which mers of the same type tend to group themselves into long segments along the chain; and (d) graft, in which mers of one type are attached as branches to a main backbone of mers of the other type.

Not all poly mers can form crystals. For those that can, the degree of crystallinity (the propor tion of crystallized material in the mass) is always less than 100%.As crystallinity is increased in a polymer, so are (1) density, (2) stiffness, strength, and toughness, and (3) heat resistance. In addition, (4) if the polymer is transparent in the amorphous state, it becomes opaque when partially crystallized. Many polymers are transparent, but only in the amorphous (glassy) state. Some of these effects can be illustrated by the differences between low-density and high-density polyethylene,presented in Table 8.2.The underlying reason for the property differences between these materials is the degree of crystallinity. \rLinear polymers consist of long molecules with thousands of repeated mers. Crystallization in these polymers involves the folding back and forth of the long chains \r\rTABLE \u2022 8.2 Comparison of low-density polyethylene and high-density polyethylene. \r\r\r\rPolyethylene Type  Low Density  High Density  \rDegree of crystallinity  55%  92%  \rSpeci\ufb01c gravity  0.92  0.96  \rModulus of elasticity  140 MPa (20,000 lbin2)  700 MPa (100,000 lbin2)  \rMelting temperature  115\u00b0C (239\u00b0F)  135\u00b0C (275\u00b0F)  \r\rCompiled from [6]. Values given are typical. \r\rupon themselves to achieve a very regular arrangement of the mers, as pictured in Figure 8.9(a). The crystallized regions are called crystallites. Owing to the tremendous length of a single molecule (on an atomic scale), it may participate in more than one crystallite. Also, more than one molecule may be combined in a single crystal region.The crystallites take the form of lamellae,as pictured in Figure 8.9(b),that are randomly mixed in with the amorphous material. Thus, a polymer that crystallizes is a two-phase system\u2014crystallites interspersed throughout an amorphous matrix. \rA number of factors determine the capacity and/or tendency of a polymer to form crystalline regions within the material. The factors can be summarized as follows: \r(1) as a general rule, only linear polymers can form crystals; (2) stereoregularity of the molecule is critical [15]: isotactic polymers always form crystals; syndiotactic polymers sometimes form crystals; atactic polymers never form crystals; (3) copolymers, due to their molecular irregularity, rarely form crystals; (4) slower cooling promotes crystal formation and growth, as it does in metals and ceramics; (5) mechanical deformation, as in the stretching of a heated thermoplastic, tends to align the structure and increase crystallization; and (6) plasticizers (chemicals added to a polymer to soften it) reduce the degree of crystallinity. \r\r8.1.4 THERMAL BEHAVIOR OF POLYMERS \rThe thermal behavior of polymers with crystalline structures is different from that of amorphous polymers (Section 2.4).

The effect of structure can be observed on a plot of speci\ufb01c volume (reciprocal of density) as a function of temperature, as plotted in Figure 8.10. A highly crystalline polymer has a melting point Tm at which its volume undergoes an abrupt change. Also, at temperatures above Tm, the thermal expansion of the molten material is greater than for the solid material below Tm. An amorphous polymer does not undergo the same abrupt changes at Tm. As it is cooled from the liquid, its coef\ufb01 cient of thermal expansion continues to decline along the \rFIGURE 8.10 Behavior of polymers as a function of temperature. \r\r\r8.1.5 ADDITIVES \r\rsame trajectory as when it was molten, and it becomes increasingly viscous with decreasing temperature. During cooling below Tm, the polymer changes from liquid to rubbery.As temperature continues to drop,a point is \ufb01 nally reached at which the thermal expansion of the amorphous polymer suddenly becomes lower. This is the glass-transition temperature, Tg (Section 3.5), seen as the change in slope. Below Tg, the material is hard and brittle. \rA partially crystallized polymer lies between these two extremes, as indicated in Figure 8.10. It is an average of the amorphous and crystalline states, the average depending on the degree of crystallinity. Above Tm it exhibits the viscous characteristics of a liquid; between Tm and Tg it has viscoelastic properties; and below Tg it has the conventional elastic properties of a solid. \rWhat is described in this section applies to thermoplastic materials, which can move up and down the curve of Figure 8.10 multiple times.The manner in which they are heated and cooled may change the path that is followed. For example, fast cooling rates may inhibit crystal formation and increase the glass-transition temperature. Thermosets and elastomers cooled from the liquid state behave like an amorphous polymer until cross-linking occurs. Their molecular structure restricts the formation of crystals.And once their molecules are cross-linked,they cannot be reheated to the molten state. \rThe properties of a polymer can often be bene\ufb01cially changed by combining them with additives.Additives either alter the molecular structure of the polymer or add a second phase to the plastic,in effect transforming a polymer into a composite material.Additives can be classi\ufb01ed by function as (1) \ufb01llers,(2) plasticizers,(3) colorants, \r(4) lubricants, (5) \ufb02ame retardants, (6) cross-linking agents, (7) ultraviolet light absorbers, and (8) antioxidants. \rFiller Fillers are solid materials added to a polymer usually in particulate or \ufb01brous form to alter its mechanical properties or to simply reduce material cost. Other reasons for using \ufb01llers are to improve dimensional and thermal stability. Examples of \ufb01llers used in polymers include cellulosic \ufb01bers and powders (e.g., cotton \ufb01bers and wood \ufb02our, respectively); powders of silica (SiO2), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and clay (hydrous aluminum silicate); and \ufb01bers of glass, metal, carbon, or other polymers. Fillers that improve mechanical properties are called reinforcing agents, and composites thus created are referred to as reinforced plastics; they have higher stiffness, strength, hardness, and toughness than the original polymer. Fibers provide the greatest strengthening effect. \r\rPlasticizers Plasticizers are chemicals added to a polymer to make it softer and more \ufb02exible, and to improve its \ufb02ow characteristics during forming. The plasticizer works by reducing the glass transition temperature to below room temperature. Whereas the polymer is hard and brittle below Tg,it is soft and tough above it.Addition of a plasticizer1 to polyvinylchloride (PVC) is a good example; depending on the proportion of plasticizer in the mix, PVC can be obtained in a range of properties, from rigid and brittle to \ufb02exible and rubbery. \rColorants An advantage of many polymers over metals or ceramics is that the material itself can be obtained in most any color.

This eliminates the need for secondary coating operations. Colorants for polymers are of two types: pigments and dies. Pigments are \ufb01nely powdered materials that are insoluble in and must be uniformly distributed throughout the polymer in very low concentrations, usually less that 1%. They often add opacity as well as color to the plastic. Dies are chemicals, usually supplied in liquid form, that are generally soluble in the polymer. They are normally used to color transparent plastics such as styrene and acrylics. \rOther Additives Lubricants are sometimes added to the polymer to reduce friction and promote \ufb02ow at the mold interface. Lubricants are also helpful in releasing the part from the mold in injection molding. Mold release agents, sprayed onto the mold surface, are often used for the same purpose. \rNearly all polymers burn if the required heat and oxygen are supplied. Some polymers are more combustible than others. Flame retardants are chemicals added to polymers to reduce \ufb02ammability by any or a combination of the following mechanisms: (1) interfering with \ufb02ame propagation, (2) producing large amounts of incombustible gases, and/or (3) increasing the combustion temperature of the material. The chemicals may also function to (4) reduce the emission of noxious or toxic gases generated during combustion. \rAdditives that cause cross-linking in thermosetting polymers and elastomers should be included in the discussion here. The term cross-linking agent refers to a variety of ingredients that cause a cross-linking reaction or act as a catalyst to promote such a reaction. Important commercial examples are (1) sulfur in vulcanization of natural rubber, (2) formaldehyde for phenolics to form phenolic thermosetting plastics, and (3) peroxides for polyesters. \rMany polymers are susceptible to degradation by ultraviolet light (e.g., from sunlight) and oxidation. The degradation manifests itself as the breaking of links in the long chain molecules. Polyethylene, for example, is vulnerable to both types of degradation, which lead to a loss of mechanical strength. Ultraviolet light absorbers and antio xidants are additives that reduce the susceptibility of the polymer to these forms of attack. \r1The common plasticizer in PVC is dioctyl phthalate, a phthalate ester. \r\r\r\rThermoplastic Polymers \rThis section discusses the properties of the thermoplastic polymer group and provides a survey of its important members. \r\r8.2.1 PROPERTIES OF THERMOPLASTIC POLYMERS \rThe de\ufb01ning property of a thermoplastic polymer is that it can be heated from a solid state to a viscous liquid state and then cooled back down to solid, and that this heating and cooling cycle can be applied multiple times without degrading the polymer. The reason for this property is that TP polymers consist of linear (and/or branched) macromolecules that do not cross-link when heated. By contrast, thermo-sets and elastomers undergo a chemical change when heated, which cross-links their molecules and permanently sets these polymers. \rIn truth, thermoplastics do deteriorate chemically with repeated heating and cooling. In plastic molding, a distinction is made between new or virgin material, and plastic that has been previously molded (e.g., sprues, defective parts) and therefore has experienced thermal cycling. For some applications, only virgin material is acceptable. Thermoplastic polymers also degrade gradually when subjected to continuous elevated temperatures below Tm. This long-term effect is called thermal aging and involves slow chemical deterioration. Some TP polymers are more susceptible to thermal aging than others, and for a given material the rate of deterioration depends on temperature.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 31268, "end_char_idx": 35708, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7669ad4-78c0-4171-80c4-bd65976a12fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7669ad4-78c0-4171-80c4-bd65976a12fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ab637be5-b587-4f0b-851a-438c01bdf65a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "e244bbb9ca0d5ff001b05122fbc1ca7b4f466e290ba4e6a82dc46c0532acd61e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8520bef-3f18-43f9-8b27-5e8608f29c2c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "a0cdcbd5ebf79452af07fe1cb5c3b9e909c9ea6ba3da1a51466cc1ca954fc687", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "15adafa7-7a24-4af0-ada9-0d328c89ff1a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff06dad3823621a635cc7f20537a11fb95fb7fe2d96e7093d20abff0ea6975e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The reason for this property is that TP polymers consist of linear (and/or branched) macromolecules that do not cross-link when heated.

This long-term effect is called thermal aging and involves slow chemical deterioration. Some TP polymers are more susceptible to thermal aging than others, and for a given material the rate of deterioration depends on temperature. \rMechanical Properties In the discussion of mechanical properties in Chapter 3, polymers were compared with metals and ceramics. The typical thermoplastic at room temperature is characterized by the following: (1) much lower stiffness, the modulus of elasticity being two (in some cases, three) orders of magnitude lower than metals and ceramics; (2) lower tensile strength, about 10% of the metals; (3) much lower hardness; and (4) greater ductility on average, but there is a tremendous range of values, from 1% elongation for polystyrene to 500% or more for polypropylene. \rMechanical properties of thermoplastics depend on temperature. The functional relationships must be discussed in the context of amorphous and crystalline structures.Amorphous thermoplastics are rigid and glass-like below their glass transition temperature Tg and \ufb02exible or rubber-like just above it. As temperature increases above Tg, the polymer becomes increasingly soft, \ufb01 nally becoming a viscous \ufb02uid (it never becomes a thin liquid due to its high molecular weight). The effect on mechanical behavior can be portrayed as in Figure 8.11, in which mechanical behavior is de\ufb01ned as deformation resistance. This is analogous to modulus of elasticity but it allows us to observe the effect of temperature on the amorphous polymer as it transitions from solid to liquid. Below Tg, the material is elastic and strong. At Tg, a rather sudden drop in deformation resistance is observed as the material transforms into its rubbery phase; its behavior is viscoelastic in this region. As temperature increases, it gradually becomes more \ufb02 uid-like. \rA theoretical thermoplastic with 100% crystallinity would have a distinct melting point Tm at which it transforms from solid to liquid, but would show no perceptible Tg point. Of course, real polymers have less than 100% crystallinity. For partially crystallized polymers, the resistance to deformation is characterized by the curve that lies between the two extremes, its position determined by the relative proportions of the \r\rFIGURE 8.11 Relationship of mechanical properties, portrayed as deformation resistance, as a function of temperature for an amorphous thermoplastic, a 100% crystalline (theoretical) thermoplastic, and a partially crystallized thermoplastic. \r\rtwo phases. The partially crystallized polymer exhibits features of both amorphous and fully crystallized plastics. Below Tg, it is elastic with deformation resistance sloping downward with rising temperatures.Above Tg, the amorphous portions of the polymer soften, while the crystalline portions remain intact. The bulk material exhibits properties that are generally viscoelastic. As Tm is reached, the crystals now melt, giving the polymer a liquid consistency; resistance to deformation is now due to the \ufb02uid\u2019s viscous properties. The degree to which the polymer assumes liquid characteristics at and above Tm depends on molecular weight and degree of polymerization. Higher DP and MW reduces \ufb02 ow of the polymer, making it more dif\ufb01cult to process by molding and similar shaping methods.This is a dilemma faced by those who select these materials because higher MW and DP mean higher strength. \rPhysical Properties Physical properties of materials are discussed in Chapter 4.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 34742, "end_char_idx": 38985, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15adafa7-7a24-4af0-ada9-0d328c89ff1a": {"__data__": {"id_": "15adafa7-7a24-4af0-ada9-0d328c89ff1a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ab637be5-b587-4f0b-851a-438c01bdf65a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "e244bbb9ca0d5ff001b05122fbc1ca7b4f466e290ba4e6a82dc46c0532acd61e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d7669ad4-78c0-4171-80c4-bd65976a12fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "0cffaca2264deb2d863377ddd043c0f8dad46cda55145fb9c27f55220512de09", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "54cd4918-4d04-4aef-9e72-249c34332ff3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0d5a0054a098610ed5ed3e96d233a524cba498660cb6f99a7d61800a1dc265e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The partially crystallized polymer exhibits features of both amorphous and fully crystallized plastics.

The most important TP polymers are discussed in alphabetical order in this section.For each plastic,Table 8.3 lists the chemical formula and selected properties. Approximate market share is given relative to all plastics (thermoplastic and thermosetting). \r\r\r\rTABLE \u2022 8.3 Important commercial thermoplastic polymers: (a) acetala. \rPolymer: Polyoxymethylene, also known as polyacetal (OCH2)n \rSymbol: POM Polymerization method: Step (condensation) Degree of crystallinity: 75% typical Modulus of elasticity: 3500 MPa (500,000 lbin2) Tensile strength: 70 MPa (10,000 lbin2) \rElongation:  25%75%  \rSpeci\ufb01c gravity:  1.42  \rGlass transition temperature:  80\u00b0C (112\u00b0F)  \rMelting temperature:  180\u00b0C (356\u00b0F)  \rApproximate market share:  Much less than 1%  \r\r\raTable 8.3 is compiled from [2], [4], [6], [7], [9], [16], and other sources. \rAcetals Acetal is the popular name given to polyoxymethylene, an engineering polymer prepared from formaldehyde (CH2O) with high stiffness, strength, toughness, and wear resistance. In addition, it has a high melting point, low moisture absorption, and is insoluble in common solvents at ambient temperatures. Because of this combination of properties, acetal resins are competitive with certain metals (e.g., brass and zinc) in automotive components such as door handles, pump housings, and similar parts; appliance hardware; and machinery components. \rAcrylics The acrylics are polymers derived from acrylic acid (C3H4O2) and compounds originating from it. The most important thermoplastic in the acrylics group is polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) or Plexiglas (Rohm & Haas\u2019s trade name for PMMA). Data on PMMA are listed in Table 8.3(b).

ABS is a two-phase terpolymer, one phase being the hard copolymer styrene\u2013acrylonitrile, while the other phase is styrene-butadiene copolymer that is rubbery. The name of the plastic is derived from the three starting monomers, which may be mixed in various proportions.

Nylon is strong, highly elastic, tough, abrasion resistant, and self-lubricating. It retains good mechanical properties at temperatures up to about 125\u00b0C (250\u00b0F). One shortcoming is that it absorbs water with an accompanying degradation in properties.The majority of applications of nylon (about 90%) are in \ufb01bers for carpets, apparel, and tire cord. The remainder (10%) are in engineering components; nylon is commonly a good substitute for metals in bearings, gears, and similar parts where strength and low friction are needed. \rA second group of polyamides is the aramids (aromatic polyamides) of which Kevlar (DuPont trade name) is gaining in importance as a \ufb01ber in reinforced plastics. The reason for the interest in Kevlar is that its strength is the same as steel at 20% of the weight. \rPolycarbonate Polycarbonate (PC) is noted for its generally excellent mechanical properties, which include high toughness and good creep resistance.

The PET \ufb01bers are almost always blended with cotton or wool. Familiar trade names for polyester \ufb01 bers include Dacron (DuPont) and Fortrel (Celanese). \rPolyethylene Polyethylene (PE) was \ufb01rst synthesized in the 1930s, and today it accounts for the largest volume of all plastics. The features that make PE attractive as an engineering material are low cost, chemical inertness, and easy processing. Polyethylene is available in several grades, the most common of which are low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE).The low-density grade is a highly branched polymer with lower crystallinity and density.Applications include squeezable bottles, frozen food bags, sheets, \ufb01lm, and wire insulation. HDPE has a more linear structure, with higher crystallinity and density. These differences make HDPE stiffer and stronger and give it a higher melting temperature. HDPE is used to produce bottles,pipes,and housewares. Both grades can be processed by most polymer shaping methods (Chapter 13).

Other applications are injection molded parts for automotive and houseware, and \ufb01ber products for carpeting. A special application suited to polypropylene is one-piece hinges that can be subjected to a high number of \ufb02 exing cycles without failure. \rPolystyrene There are several polymers, copolymers, and terpolymers based on the monomer styrene (C8H8), of which polystyrene (PS) is used in the highest volume. It is a linear homopolymer with amorphous structure that is generally noted for its brittleness. PS is transparent, easily colored, and readily molded, but degrades at elevated temperatures and dissolves in various solvents. Because of its brittleness, some PS grades contain 5% to 15% rubber and the term high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) is used for these types. They have higher toughness, but transparency and tensile strength are reduced. In addition to injection molding applications (e.g., molded toys, housewares), polystyrene also \ufb01nds uses in packaging in the form of PS foams. \rPolyvinylchloride Polyvinylchloride (PVC) is a widely used plastic whose properties can be varied by combining additives with the polymer. In particular, plasticizers are used to achieve thermoplastics ranging from rigid PVC (no plasticizers) to \ufb02exible PVC (high proportions of plasticizer).The range of properties makes PVC a versatile polymer, with applications that include rigid pipe (used in construction, water and \r\rTABLE \u2022 8.3 (continued): (k) polystyrene. \r\rTABLE \u2022 8.3 (continued): (l) polyvinylchloride. \r\raWith no plasticizer. \rsewer systems, irrigation), \ufb01ttings, wire and cable insulation, \ufb01lm, sheets, food packaging, \ufb02 ooring, and toys. PVC by itself is relatively unstable to heat and light, and stabilizers must be added to improve its resistance to these environmental conditions. Care must be taken in the production and handling of the vinyl chloride monomer used to polymerize PVC, due to its carcinogenic nature. \r\r\r8.3 Thermosetting Polymers \rThermosetting (TS) polymers are distinguished by their highly cross-linked structure. In effect, the formed part (e.g., the pot handle or electrical switch cover) becomes one large macromolecule. Thermosets are always amorphous and exhibit no glass transition temperature. This section examines the general characteristics of the TS plastics and identify the important materials in this category. \r8.3.1 GENERAL PROPERTIES AND CHARACTERISTICS \rOwing to differences in chemistry and molecular structure, properties of thermosetting plastics are different from those of thermoplastics. In general, thermosets are \r(1) more rigid\u2014modulus of elasticity is two to three times greater; (2) brittle\u2014they possess virtually no ductility; (3) less soluble in common solvents; (4) capable of higher service temperatures; and (5) not capable of being remelted\u2014instead they degrade or burn. \rThe differences in properties of the TS plastics are attributable to cross-linking, which forms a thermally stable, three-dimensional, covalently bonded structure within the molecule. Cross-linking is accomplished in three ways [7]: \r1. \rTemperature-activated systems\u2014In the most common systems, the changes are caused by heat supplied during the part shaping operation (e.g., molding). The starting material is a linear polymer in granular form supplied by the chemical plant. As heat is added, the material softens for molding; continued heating results in cross-linking of the polymer. The term thermosetting is most aptly applied to these polymers. \r\r2.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 52537, "end_char_idx": 56681, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93ece265-a6f4-404e-9e33-ea438f75f882": {"__data__": {"id_": "93ece265-a6f4-404e-9e33-ea438f75f882", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ab637be5-b587-4f0b-851a-438c01bdf65a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "e244bbb9ca0d5ff001b05122fbc1ca7b4f466e290ba4e6a82dc46c0532acd61e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "35e4bc1d-0429-4f85-8c36-2b7b55a6d8a3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "0bf5c796caeb65639579dacd6473565e6eacb700ad3a91f226b1db3d33147942", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c7e3aa4a-3b05-4991-bec2-ee75dbc64d4c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "13fc8f1ce6010709b3488786cca3ab0bdac8ea3b155794c2b3ee5246c00525ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The differences in properties of the TS plastics are attributable to cross-linking, which forms a thermally stable, three-dimensional, covalently bonded structure within the molecule.

Without the catalyst, the polymer remains stable; once combined with the catalyst, it changes into solid form. \r\r\r3. Mixing-activated systems\u2014Most epoxies are examples of these systems. The mixing of two chemicals results in a reaction that forms a cross-linked solid polymer. Elevated temperatures are sometimes used to accelerate the reactions. \rThe chemical reactions associated with cross-linking are called curing or setting. Curing is done at the fabrication plants that shape the parts rather than the chemical plants that supply the starting materials to the fabricator. \r\r\r8.3.2 IMPORTANT THERMOSETTING POLYMERS \rThermosetting plastics are not as widely used as the thermoplastics, perhaps because of the added processing complications involved in curing the TS polymers.The largest volume thermosets are phenolic resins, whose annual volume is about 6% of the total plastics market.This is signi\ufb01cantly less than polyethylene,the leading thermoplastic, whose volume is about 35% of the total. Technical data for these materials are given in Table 8.4. Market share data refer to total plastics (TP plus TS). \rAmino Resins Amino plastics, characterized by the amino group (NH2), consist of two thermosetting polymers, urea-formaldehyde and melamine-formaldehyde, which are produced by the reaction of formaldehyde (CH2O) with either urea (CO(NH2)2) or melamine (C3H6N6), respectively. In commercial importance, the amino resins rank just below the other formaldehyde resin, phenol-formaldehyde, discussed below. Urea\u2013formaldehyde is competitive with the phenols in certain applications, particularly as a plywood and particle-board adhesive. The resins are also used as a molding compound. It is slightly more expensive than the phenol material. Melamine\u2013formaldehyde plastic is water resistant and is used for dishware and as a coating in laminated table and counter tops (Formica, trade name of Cyanamid Co.).When used as molding materials,amino plastics usually contain signi\ufb01cant proportions of \ufb01llers, such as cellulose. \rEpoxies Epoxy resins are based on a chemical group called the epoxides.The simplest formulation of epoxide is ethylene oxide (C2H3O). Epichlorohydrin (C3H5OCl) is a much more widely used epoxide for producing epoxy resins. Uncured, epoxides have a low degree of polymerization.To increase molecular weight and to cross-link the epoxide, a curing agent must be used.

Phenol-formaldehyde is the most important of the phenolic polymers; it was \ufb01 rst commercialized around 1900 under the trade name Bakelite. It is almost always combined with \ufb01 llers such as wood \ufb02 our, cellulose \ufb01bers, and minerals when used as a molding material.

They are available under brand names such as Kapton (Dupont) and Kaptrex (Professional Plastics) in several forms including tapes, \ufb01lms, coatings, and molding resins. TS polyimides (PI) are noted for chemical resistance, high tensile strength and stiffness, and stability at elevated temperatures. They are called high-temperature polymers due to their excellent heat resistance. Applications that exploit these properties include insulating \ufb01lms, molded parts used in elevated temperature service, \ufb02exible cables in laptop computers, medical tubing, and \ufb01bers for protective clothing. \rPolyurethanes This includes a large family of polymers, all characterized by the urethane group (NHCOO) in their structure.

Through variations in chemistry, cross-linking, and processing, polyurethanes can be thermoplastic, thermosetting, or elastomeric materials, the latter two being the most important commercially. The largest application of polyurethane is in foams. These can range between elastomeric and rigid, the latter being more highly cross-linked. Rigid foams are used as a \ufb01ller material in hollow construction panels and refrigerator walls. In these types of applications, the material provides excellent thermal insulation, adds rigidity to the structure, and does not absorb water in signi\ufb01cant amounts. Many paints, varnishes, and similar coating materials are based on urethane systems. Polyurethane elastomers are discussed in Section 8.4. \rSilicones Silicones are inorganic and semi-inorganic polymers, distinguished by the presence of the repeating siloxane link (\u2013Si\u2013O\u2013) in their molecular structure. A typical formulation combines the methyl radical (CH3) with (SiO) in various proportions to obtain the repeating unit\u2013((CH3)m\u2013SiO)\u2013, where m establishes the proportionality. By variations in composition and processing, polysiloxanes can be produced in three forms: (1) \ufb02uids, (2) elastomers, and (3) thermosetting resins. Fluids are low molecular weight polymers used for lubricants, polishes, waxes, and other liquid products\u2014not really polymers in the sense of this chapter, but important commercially nevertheless. Silicone elastomers, covered in Section 8.4, and thermosetting silicones, treated here, are cross-linked. When highly cross-linked, polysiloxanes form rigid resin systems used for paints, varnishes, and other coatings; and laminates such as printed circuit boards. They are also used as molding materials for electrical parts. Curing is accomplished by heating or by allowing the solvents containing the polymers to evaporate. Silicones are noted for their good heat resistance and water repellence, but their mechanical strength is not as great as other cross-linked polymers. Data in Table 8.4(g) are for a typical silicone thermosetting polymer. \r\r\r8.4 Elastomers \rElastomers are polymers capable of large elastic deformation when subjected to relatively low stresses. Some elastomers can withstand extensions of 500% or more and still return to their original shape.The more popular term for elastomer is,of course, rubber. Rubbers can be divided into two categories: (1) natural rubber, derived from certain biological plants; and (2) synthetic elastomers, produced by polymerization processes similar to those used for thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers.

Rubbers can be divided into two categories: (1) natural rubber, derived from certain biological plants; and (2) synthetic elastomers, produced by polymerization processes similar to those used for thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers. Before discussing natural and synthetic rubbers, consider the general characteristics of elastomers. \rSection 8.4/Elastomers 201 \rFIGURE 8.12 Model of long elastomermolecules, with low degree of cross-linking:\r(a) unstretched, and (b)under tensile stress. \r\r8.4.1 CHARACTERISTICS OF ELASTOMERS \r\rElastomers consist of long-chain molecules that are cross-linked. They owe their impressive elastic properties to the combination of two features: (1) the long molecules are tightly kinked when unstretched, and (2) the degree of cross-linking is substantially below that of the thermosets.These features are illustrated in the model of Figure 8.12(a), which shows a tightly kinked cross-linked molecule under no stress. \rWhen the material is stretched, the molecules are forced to uncoil and straighten as shown in Figure 8.12(b). The molecules\u2019 natural resistance to uncoiling provides the initial elastic modulus of the aggregate material.As further strain is experienced, the covalent bonds of the cross-linked molecules begin to play an increasing role in the modulus, and the stiffness increases as illustrated in Figure 8.13. With greater cross-linking, the elastomer becomes stiffer and its modulus of elasticity is more linear. These characteristics are shown in the \ufb01gure by the stress-strain curves for three grades of rubber: natural crude rubber, whose cross-linking is very low; cured (vulcanized) rubber with low-to-medium cross-linking; and hard rubber (ebonite), whose high degree of cross-linking transforms it into a thermosetting plastic. \rFor a polymer to exhibit elastomeric properties, it must be amorphous in the unstretched condition, and its temperature must be above Tg. If below the glass transition temperature, the material is hard and brittle; above Tg the polymer is in the \u201crubbery\u201d state.Any amorphousthermoplasticpolymer will exhibit elastomeric properties above Tg for a short time, because its linear molecules are always coiled to some extent, thus allowing for elastic extension. It is the absence of cross-linking in TP polymers that prevents them from being truly elastic; instead they exhibit viscoelastic behavior. \rCuring is required to effect cross-linking in most of the common elastomers today. The term for curing used in the context of natural rubber (and certain synthetic rubbers) is vulcanization, which involves the formation of chemical cross-links between the polymer chains. Typical cross-linking in rubber is 1 to 10 links per 100 carbon \r\rFIGURE 8.13 \rIncrease in stiffness as a function of strain for three grades ofrubber: natural rubber, vulcanized rubber, and hard rubber. \r\ratoms in the linear polymer chain, depending on the degree of stiffness desired in the material. This is considerably less than the degree of cross-linking in thermosets. \rAn alternative method of curing involves the use of starting chemicals that react when mixed (sometimes requiring a catalyst or heat) to form elastomers with relatively infrequent cross-links between molecules. These synthetic rubbers are known as reactive system elastomers. Certain polymers that cure by this means, such as urethanes and silicones, can be classi\ufb01ed as either thermosets or elastomers, depending on the degree of cross-linking achieved during the reaction. \rA relatively new class of elastomers, called thermoplastic elastomers, possesses elastomeric properties that result from the mixture of two phases, both thermoplastic.

The \ufb01rst deals with \rnatural rubber and how it is vulcanized to create a useful commercial material; the \rsecond examines the synthetic rubbers. \r\r8.4.2 NATURAL RUBBER \rNatural rubber (NR) consists primarily of polyisoprene, a high-molecular-weight polymer of isoprene (C5H8). It is derived from latex, a milky substance produced by various plants, the most important of which is the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) that grows in tropical climates (Historical Note 8.2).Latex is a water emulsion of polyisoprene (about one third by weight), plus various other ingredients. Rubber is extracted from the latex by various methods (e.g., coagulation, drying, and spraying) that remove the water. \rHistorical Note 8.2 Natural rubber \rThe \ufb01 rst use of natural rubber seems to have been in the form of rubber balls used for sport by the natives of Central and South America at least 500 hundred years ago. Columbus noted this during his second voyage to the New World in 1493\u201396. The balls were made from the dried gum of a rubber tree. The \ufb01 rst white men in South America called the tree caoutchouc, which was their way of pronouncing the Indian name for it. The name rubber came from the English chemist Joseph Priestley, who discovered (around 1770) that gum rubber would \u201crub\u201d away pencil marks. \rEarly rubber goods were less than satisfactory; they melted in summer heat and hardened in winter cold. One of those in the business of making and selling rubber goods was American Charles Goodyear. Recognizing the de\ufb01ciencies of the natural material, he experimented with ways to improve its properties and discovered that rubber could be cured by heating it with sulfur. This was in 1839, and the process, later called vulcanization, was patented by him in 1844. \rVulcanization and the emerging demand for rubber products led to tremendous growth in rubber production and the industry that supported it. In 1876, Henry Wickham collected thousands of rubber tree seeds from the Brazilian jungle and planted them in England; the sprouts were later transplanted to Ceylon and Malaya (then British colonies) to form rubber plantations. Soon, other countries in the region followed the British example. Southeast Asia became the base of the rubber industry. \rIn 1888, a British veterinary surgeon named John Dunlop patented pneumatic tires for bicycles. By the twentieth century, the motorcar industry was developing in the United States and Europe. Together, the automobile and rubber industries grew to occupy positions of unimagined importance. \r\r\r\rTABLE \u2022 8.5 Characteristics and typical properties of vulcanized rubber. \r\rPolymer: Polyisoprene (C5H8)n Symbol: NR Modulus of elasticity: 18 MPa (2500 lb/in2) at 300% elongation Tensile strength: 25 MPa (3500 lb/in2) Elongation: 700% at failure \rCompiled from [2], [6], [9], and other sources. \rSpeci\ufb01c gravity:  0.93  \rHigh temperature limit:  80\u00b0C (180\u00b0F)  \rLow temperature limit:  50\u00b0C (60\u00b0F)  \rApprox. market share:  22%  \r\rNatural crude rubber (without vulcanization) is sticky in hot weather, but stiff and brittle in cold weather.

To form an elastomer with useful properties, natural rubber must be vulcanized. Traditionally, vulcanization has been accomplished by mixing small amounts of sulfur and other chemicals with the crude rubber and heating. The chemical effect of vulcanization is cross-linking; the mechanical result is increased strength and stiffness, yet maintenance of extensibility. The dramatic change in properties caused by vulcanization can be seen in the stress-strain curves of Figure 8.13. \rSulfur alone can cause cross-linking, but the process is slow, taking hours to complete. Other chemicals are added to sulfur during vulcanization to accelerate the process and serve other bene\ufb01cial functions. Also, rubber can be vulcanized using chemicals other than sulfur. Today, curing times have been reduced signi\ufb01 cantly compared to the original sulfur curing of years ago. \rAs an engineering material, vulcanized rubber is noted among elastomers for its high tensile strength, tear strength, resilience (capacity to recover shape after deformation), and resistance to wear and fatigue. Its weaknesses are that it degrades when subjected to heat, sunlight, oxygen, ozone, and oil. Some of these limitations can be reduced through the use of additives. Typical properties and other data for vulcanized natural rubber are listed in Table 8.5. Market share is relative to total annual rubber volume, natural plus synthetic. Rubber volume is about 15% of total polymer market. \rThe largest single market for natural rubber is automotive tires. In tires, carbon black is an important additive; it reinforces the rubber, serving to increase tensile strength and resistance to tearing and abrasion. Other products made of rubber include shoe soles, bushings, seals, and shock-absorbing components. In each case, the rubber is compounded to achieve the speci\ufb01c properties required in the application. Besides carbon black, other additives used in rubber and some of the synthetic elastomers include clay, kaolin, silica, talc, and calcium carbonate, as well as chemicals that accelerate and promote vulcanization. \r\r\r8.4.3 SYNTHETIC RUBBERS \rToday, the tonnage of synthetic rubbers is more than three times that of natural rubber. Development of these synthetic materials was motivated largely by the world wars when NR was dif\ufb01cult to obtain (Historical Note 8.3). The most important of the synthetics is styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), a copolymer of butadiene (C4H6) and styrene (C8H8). As with most other polymers, the predominant raw material for the synthetic rubbers is petroleum. Only the synthetic rubbers of greatest commercial \r\r\r\r\rHistorical Note 8.3 Synthetic rubbers \rIn 1826, Faraday recognized the formula of natural rubber to be C5H8.

However, the Germans, perhaps anticipating a future con\ufb02ict, renewed their development efforts.The \ufb01 rm I.G. Farben developed two synthetic rubbers, starting in the early 1930s, called Buna-S and Buna-N. Buna is derived from butadiene (C4H6), which has become the critical ingredient in many modern synthetic rubbers, and Na, the symbol for sodium, used to accelerate or catalyze the polymerization process (Natrium is the German word for sodium). The symbol S in Buna-S stands for styrene. Buna-S is the copolymer known today as styrene\u2013butadiene rubber, or SBR. The N in Buna-N stands for acryloNitrile, and the synthetic rubber is called nitrile rubber in current usage. \rOther efforts included the work at the DuPont Company in the United States, which led to the development of polychloroprene, \ufb01rst marketed in 1932 under the name Duprene, later changed to Neoprene, its current name. \rDuring World War II, the Japanese cut off the supply of natural rubber from Southeast Asia to the United States. Production of Buna-S synthetic rubber was begun on a large scale in America. The federal government preferred to use the name GR-S (Government Rubber-Styrene) rather than Buna-S (the German name). By 1944, the United States was outproducing Germany in SBR 10-to-1. Since the early 1960s, worldwide production of synthetic rubbers has exceeded that of natural rubbers. \r\r\rimportancearediscussed here.Technical data are presented inTable 8.6.Market share data are for total volume of natural and synthetic rubbers.About 10% of total volume of rubber production is reclaimed; thus, total tonnages in Tables 8.5 and 8.6 do not sum to 100%. \rButadiene Rubber Polybutadiene (BR) is important mainly in combination with other rubbers. It is compounded with natural rubber and with styrene (styrene\u2013 butadiene rubber is discussed later) in the production of automotive tires. Without compounding, the tear resistance, tensile strength, and ease of processing of polybutadiene are less than desirable. \rButyl Rubber Butyl rubber is a copolymer of polyisobutylene (98\u201399%) and polyisoprene (1\u20132%). It can be vulcanized to provide a rubber with very low air permeability, which has led to applications in in\ufb02atable products such as inner tubes, liners in tubeless tires, and sporting goods. \rTABLE \u2022 8.6 Characteristics and typical properties of synthetic rubbers: (a) butadiene rubber. \r\r\rPolymer: Polybutadiene (C4H6)n Symbol: BR Tensile strength: 15 MPa (2000 lb/in2) Elongation: 500% at failure \rTable 8.6 is compiled from [2], [6], [9], [11], and other sources. \rSpeci\ufb01c gravity:  0.93  \rHigh temperature limit:  100\u00b0C (210\u00b0F)  \rLow temperature limit:  \u201350\u00b0C (\u201360\u00b0F)  \rApprox. market share:  12%  \r\r\rTABLE \u2022 8.6 (continued): (b) butyl rubber. \rPolymer: Copolymer of isobutylene (C4H8)n and isoprene (C5H8)n \r\r\r\rSymbol: PIB Modulus of elasticity: 7 MPa (1000 lb/in2) at 300% elongation Tensile strength: 20 MPa (3000 lb/in2) Elongation: 700% \rTABLE \u2022 8.6 (continued): (c) chloroprene rubber (neoprene).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 77729, "end_char_idx": 81268, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a66191b-1479-4710-a917-8b7ee19b7b52": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a66191b-1479-4710-a917-8b7ee19b7b52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ab637be5-b587-4f0b-851a-438c01bdf65a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "e244bbb9ca0d5ff001b05122fbc1ca7b4f466e290ba4e6a82dc46c0532acd61e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cc3d3aba-5ee2-4bf2-bd23-69756abaf089", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "de1d7c7c821384c9f90e73fac4d55497745504f0b42c33b6695013a60c6d2105", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cad22929-5a4e-4b73-a2f7-72daae417cf0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9db000e15db29772be1fb647197c1041463e835a9750cec6c421958e4e7d5a5f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Speci\ufb01c gravity:  0.93  \rHigh temperature limit:  100\u00b0C (210\u00b0F)  \rLow temperature limit:  \u201350\u00b0C (\u201360\u00b0F)  \rApprox. market share:  12%  \r\r\rTABLE \u2022 8.6 (continued): (b) butyl rubber. \rPolymer: Copolymer of isobutylene (C4H8)n and isoprene (C5H8)n \r\r\r\rSymbol: PIB Modulus of elasticity: 7 MPa (1000 lb/in2) at 300% elongation Tensile strength: 20 MPa (3000 lb/in2) Elongation: 700% \rTABLE \u2022 8.6 (continued): (c) chloroprene rubber (neoprene). \rSpeci\ufb01c gravity:  0.92  \rHigh temperature limit:  110\u00b0C (220\u00b0F)  \rLow temperature limit:  \u201350\u00b0C (\u201360\u00b0F)  \rApprox. market share:  about 3%  \r\r\rPolymer:  Polychloroprene (C4H5Cl)n  \rSymbol:  CR  \rModulus of elasticity:  7 MPa (1000 lb/in2) at 300% elongation  \rTensile strength:  25 MPa (3500 lb/in2)  \rElongation:  500% at failure  \r\rSpeci\ufb01c gravity:  1.23  \rHigh temperature limit:  120\u00b0C (250\u00b0F)  \rLow temperature limit:  \u201320\u00b0C (\u201310\u00b0F)  \rApprox. market share:  2%  \r\rChloroprene Rubber Polychloroprene was one of the \ufb01rst synthetic rubbers to be developed (early 1930s). Commonly known today as Neoprene, it is an important special-purpose rubber. It crystallizes when strained to provide good mechanical properties. Chloroprene rubber (CR) is more resistant to oils, weather, ozone, heat, and \ufb02ame (chlorine makes this rubber self-extinguishing) than NR, but somewhat more expensive. Its applications include fuel hoses (and other automotive parts), conveyor belts, and gaskets, but not tires. \rEthylene\u2013Propylene Rubber Polymerization of ethylene and propylene with small proportions (3\u20138%) of a diene monomer produces the terpolymer ethylene\u2013 propylene\u2013diene (EPDM),a useful synthetic rubber.Applications are for parts mostly in the automotive industry other than tires. Other uses are wire and cable insulation. \rIsoprene Rubber Isoprene can be polymerized to synthesize a chemical equivalent of natural rubber. Synthetic (unvulcanized) polyisoprene is softer and more easily molded than raw natural rubber. Applications of the synthetic material are similar to those of its natural counterpart, car tires being the largest single market. It is also used for footwear, conveyor belts, and caulking compound. Cost per unit weight is about 35% higher than for NR. \r\rTABLE \u2022 8.6 (continued): (d) ethylene\u2013propylene\u2013diene rubber. \rRepresentative polymer:  Terpolymer of ethylene (C2H4), propylene (C3H6), and a diene monomer (3\u20138%) for  \rcross-linking.  \rSymbol:  EPDM  Speci\ufb01c gravity:  0.86  \rTensile strength:  15 MPa (2000 lb/in2)  High temperature limit:  150\u00b0C (300\u00b0F)  \rElongation:  300% at failure  Low temperature limit:  \u201350\u00b0C (\u201360\u00b0F)  \rApprox. market share:  5%  \r\r\r\rTABLE \u2022 8.6 (continued): (e) isoprene rubber (synthetic). \r\rPolymer: Polyisoprene (C5H8)n Symbol: IR Modulus of elasticity: 17 MPa (2500 lb/in2) at 300% elongation Tensile strength: 25 MPa (3500 lb/in2) Elongation: 500% at failure \rTABLE \u2022 8.6 (continued): (f) nitrile rubber. \rSpeci\ufb01c gravity:  0.93  \rHigh temperature limit:  80\u00b0C (180\u00b0F)  \rLow temperature limit:  \u201350\u00b0C (\u201360\u00b0F)  \rApprox.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 80830, "end_char_idx": 83839, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cad22929-5a4e-4b73-a2f7-72daae417cf0": {"__data__": {"id_": "cad22929-5a4e-4b73-a2f7-72daae417cf0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ab637be5-b587-4f0b-851a-438c01bdf65a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "e244bbb9ca0d5ff001b05122fbc1ca7b4f466e290ba4e6a82dc46c0532acd61e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7a66191b-1479-4710-a917-8b7ee19b7b52", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "13ed1c7070fe9c7b08f5caafbf6d21629542ee3f15b2c5698e682e921d572795", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c567283c-edac-49a4-9201-142113c3474f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e43d4819bbfb25c70d7fa38c64bc75d4bba7c2cdcfd83233f4c84fef0dab171", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "market share:  5%  \r\r\r\rTABLE \u2022 8.6 (continued): (e) isoprene rubber (synthetic). \r\rPolymer: Polyisoprene (C5H8)n Symbol: IR Modulus of elasticity: 17 MPa (2500 lb/in2) at 300% elongation Tensile strength: 25 MPa (3500 lb/in2) Elongation: 500% at failure \rTABLE \u2022 8.6 (continued): (f) nitrile rubber. \rSpeci\ufb01c gravity:  0.93  \rHigh temperature limit:  80\u00b0C (180\u00b0F)  \rLow temperature limit:  \u201350\u00b0C (\u201360\u00b0F)  \rApprox. market share:  2%  \r\r\rPolymer: Copolymer of butadiene (C4H6) and acrylonitrile (C3H3N) \rSymbol:  NBR  \rModulus of elasticity:  10 MPa (1500 lb/in2) at 300% elongation  \rTensile strength:  30 MPa (4000 lb/in2)  \rElongation:  500% at failure  \r\rSpeci\ufb01c gravity: 1.00 (without \ufb01llers) High temperature limit: 120\u00b0C (250\u00b0F) Low temperature limit: \u201350\u00b0F (\u201360\u00b0F) Approx. market share: 2% \r\r\rNitrile Rubber This is a vulcanizable copolymer of butadiene (50\u201375%) and acrylonitrile (25\u201350%).

These properties make it ideal for applications such as gasoline hoses and seals, and also for footwear. \rPolyurethanes Thermosetting polyurethanes with minimum cross-linking are elastomers, most commonly produced as \ufb02 exible foams. In this form, they are widely used as cushion materials for furniture and automobile seats. Unfoamed polyurethane can be molded into products ranging from shoe soles to car bumpers, with cross-linking adjusted to achieve the desired properties for the application. With no cross-linking, the material is a thermoplastic elastomer that can be injection molded. As an elastomer or thermoset, reaction injection molding and other shaping methods are used. \rSilicones Like the polyurethanes, silicones can be elastomeric or thermosetting, depending on the degree of cross-linking. Silicone elastomers are noted for the wide temperature range over which they can be used. Their resistance to oils is poor. The silicones possess various chemistries, the most common being polydimethylsiloxane, Table 8.6(h).

Its attractive features are low cost, resistance to abrasion, and better uniformity than NR. When reinforced with carbon black and vulcanized, its characteristics and applications are very similar to those of natural rubber. Cost is also similar. A close comparison of properties reveals that most of its mechanical properties except wear resistance are inferior to NR, but its resistance to heat aging, ozone, weather, and oils is superior. Applications include automotive tires, footwear, and wire and cable insulation. A material chemically related to SBR is styrene\u2013butadiene\u2013styrene block copolymer, a thermoplastic elastomer discussed below. \rThermoplastic Elastomers As previously described, a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) is a thermoplastic that behaves like an elastomer. It constitutes a family of polymers that is a fast-growing segment of the elastomer market. TPEs derive their elastomeric properties not from chemical cross-links, but from physical connections between soft and hard phases that make up the material. Thermoplastic elastomers include styrene\u2013butadiene\u2013styrene (SBS), a block copolymer as opposed to styrene\u2013 butadiene rubber (SBR) which is a random copolymer (Section 8.1.2); thermoplastic polyurethanes; thermoplastic polyester copolymers; and other copolymers and polymer blends. Table 8.6(j) gives data on SBS. The chemistry and structure of these materials are generally complex, involving two materials that are incompatible so that they form distinct phases whose room temperature properties are different. Owing to their thermoplasticity, the TPEs cannot match conventional cross-linked elastomers in elevated temperature strength and creep resistance. Typical applications include footwear, rubber bands, extruded tubing, wire coating, and molded parts for automotive and other uses in which elastomeric properties are required. TPEs are not suitable for tires. \r\r\r\rRepresentative polymer:  Styrene\u2013butadiene\u2013styrene block copolymer  \rSymbol:  SBS (also YSBR)  Speci\ufb01c gravity:  1.0  \rTensile strength:  14 MPa (2000 lb/in2)  High temperature limit:  65\u00b0C (150\u00b0F)  \rElongation:  400%  Low temperature limit:  \u201350\u00b0C (\u201360\u00b0F)  \rApprox.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 85910, "end_char_idx": 89436, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97fb2935-67e0-4ccc-8c7c-00cd994e2c4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "97fb2935-67e0-4ccc-8c7c-00cd994e2c4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ab637be5-b587-4f0b-851a-438c01bdf65a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "e244bbb9ca0d5ff001b05122fbc1ca7b4f466e290ba4e6a82dc46c0532acd61e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c567283c-edac-49a4-9201-142113c3474f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "f60450d19031b60cb4104336aae2cf9ab030770d9f394b17a63dca9b79e49eb7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a8fc2a08-3f6f-404e-8502-4653ffc97e80", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "63af58c0ddaaed4a7a657c7c07305ab7e771326774cfb26950c2bd49cfe5330d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Owing to their thermoplasticity, the TPEs cannot match conventional cross-linked elastomers in elevated temperature strength and creep resistance.

This section considers two polymer topics related to environmental concerns: (1) recycling of polymer products and (2) biodegradable plastics. \r8.5.1 POLYMER RECYCLING \rApproximately 200 million tons of plastic products are made annually throughout the world, more than one-eighth of which are produced in the United States.3 Only about 6% of the U.S. tonnage is recycled as plastic waste; the rest either remains in products and/or ends up in garbage land\ufb01 lls. Recycling means recovering the discarded plastic items and reprocessing them into new products, in some cases products that are quite different from the original discarded items. \rIn general the recycling of plastics is more dif\ufb01cult that recycling of glass and metal products. There are several reasons for this: (1) compared to plastic parts, many re cycled metal items are much larger and heavier (e.g., structural steel from buildings and bridges, steel car body frames), so the economics of recycling are more favorable for recycling metals; most plastic items are lightweight; (2) compared to plastics, which come in a variety of chemical compositions that do not mix well, glass products are all based on silicon dioxide; and (3) many plastic products contain \ufb01llers, dyes, and other additives that cannot be readily separated from the polymer itself. Of course, a common problem in all recycling efforts is the \ufb02uctuation in prices of recycled materials. \rTo cope with the problem of mixing different types of plastics and to promote re cycling of plastics,the Plastic Identi\ufb01cation Code (PIC) was developed by the Society of the Plastics Industry. The code is a symbol consisting of a triangle formed by three bent arrows enclosing a number. It is printed or molded on the plastic item. \r2en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic. 3According to the Society of Plastics Engineers,as reported in en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradable_plastic. \rThe number identi\ufb01es the plastic for recycling purposes. The seven plastics (all thermo plastics) used in the PIC recycling program are (1) polyethylene terephthalate, used in 2-liter beverage containers; (2) high-density polyethylene, used in milk jugs and shopping bags; (3) polyvinyl chloride, used in juice bottles and PVC pipes; \r(4) \rlow-density polyethylene, used in squeezable bottles and \ufb02exible container lids; \r\r(5) \rpolypropylene, used in yogurt and margarine containers; (6) polystyrene, used in egg cartons, disposable plates, cups, and utensils, and as foamed packing materials; and (7) other, such as polycarbonate or ABS. The PIC facilitates the separation of items made from the different types of plastics for reprocessing. Nevertheless, sorting the plastics is a labor-intensive activity. \r\r\rOnce separated, the thermoplastic items can be readily reprocessed into new products by remelting. This is not the case with thermosets and rubbers because of the cross-linking in these polymers. Thus, these materials must be recycled and reprocessed by different means. Recycled thermosets are typically ground up into particulate matter and used as \ufb01llers, for example, in molded plastic parts. Most recycled rubber comes from used tires.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 88809, "end_char_idx": 92957, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8fc2a08-3f6f-404e-8502-4653ffc97e80": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8fc2a08-3f6f-404e-8502-4653ffc97e80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ab637be5-b587-4f0b-851a-438c01bdf65a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "e244bbb9ca0d5ff001b05122fbc1ca7b4f466e290ba4e6a82dc46c0532acd61e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "97fb2935-67e0-4ccc-8c7c-00cd994e2c4e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec8.txt", "file_name": "sec8.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 96114, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "a4d3d0b751ba2b168ef492d4db17c45946b7af67c260c39e8d356e4f6f831445", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The PIC facilitates the separation of items made from the different types of plastics for reprocessing.

While some of these tires are retreaded, others are ground up into granules in forms such as chunks and nuggets that can be used for landscape mulch, playgrounds, and similar purposes. \r\r\r8.5.2 BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS \rAnother approach that addresses the environmental concerns about plastics involves the development of biodegradable plastics, which are de\ufb01ned as plastics that are decomposed by the actions of microorganisms occurring in nature, such as bacteria and fungi. Conventional plastic products usually consist of a combination of a petroleum-based polymer and a \ufb01ller (Section 8.1.5). In effect, the material is a polymer-matrix composite (Section 9.4). The purpose of the \ufb01ller is to improve mechanical properties and/or reduce material cost. In many cases, neither the polymer nor the \ufb01ller are biodegradable. Distinguished from these non-biodegradable plastics are two forms of biodegradable plastics: (1) partially degradable and (2) completely degradable. \rPartially biodegradable plastics consist of a conventional polymer and a natural \ufb01ller. The polymer matrix is petroleum-based, which is non-biodegradable, but the natural \ufb01ller can be consumed by microorganisms (e.g., in a land\ufb01ll), thus converting the polymer into a sponge-like structure and possibly leading to its degradation over time. \rThe plastics of greatest interest from an environmental viewpoint are the completely biodegradable plastics (a.k.a. bioplastics) consisting of a polymer and \ufb01ller that are both derived from natural and renewable sources. Various agricultural products are used as the raw materials for biodegradable plastics. A common polymeric starting material is starch, which is a major component in corn, wheat, rice, and potatoes. It consists of the two polymers amylose and amylopectin. Starch can be used to synthesize several thermoplastic materials that are processable by conventional plastic shaping methods,such as extrusion and injection molding (Chapter 13).Another starting point for biodegradable plastics involves fermentation of either corn starch or sugar cane to produce lactic acid, which can be polymerized to form polylactide, another thermoplastic material. A common \ufb01ller used in bioplastics is cellulose, often in the form of reinforcing \ufb01bers in the polymer-matrix composite. Cellulose is grown as \ufb02ax or hemp. It is inexpensive and possesses good mechanical strength.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 92344, "end_char_idx": 95352, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2bc1c2f-df1b-49c1-b44c-9f0aca176e3d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2bc1c2f-df1b-49c1-b44c-9f0aca176e3d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec9.txt", "file_name": "sec9.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38968, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4b54367c-6b28-4f80-a91a-2905bcebc90c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec9.txt", "file_name": "sec9.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38968, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "052f775b4a6c2a9efe2d4749d212542b1ae089336a3eeb590787494a825a361d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cfc35c48-4433-4791-ae07-56972e55ad13", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "49d42e0a71f76902ba5b077990431433ed347e9d71f958e0cbee6c76a0407f6c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CompositeMaterials \rChapter Contents \r\r9.1 Technology and Classi\ufb01cation of Composite Materials \r9.1.1 Components in a Composite Material \r9.1.2 The Reinforcing Phase \r9.1.3 Properties of Composite Materials \r9.1.4 Other Composite Structures \r\r\r9.2 Metal Matrix Composites \r9.2.1 Cermets \r\r9.2.2 Fiber-Reinforced Metal Matrix Composites \r\r\r9.3 Ceramic Matrix Composites \r9.4 Polymer Matrix Composites \r9.4.1 Fiber-Reinforced Polymers \r9.4.2 Other Polymer Matrix Composites \rIn addition to metals, ceramics, and polymers, a fourth material category can be distinguished: composites. A composite material is a material system composed of two or more physically distinct phases whose combination produces aggregate properties that are different from those of its constituents. In certain respects, composites are the most interesting of the engineering materials because their structure is more complex than the other three types. \rThe technological and commercial interest in composite materials derives from the fact that their properties are not just different from their components but are often far superior. Some of the possibilities include: \r\u27a2 \rComposites can be designed that are very strong and stiff, yet very light in weight, giving them strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios several times greater than steel or aluminum.These properties are highly desirable in applications ranging from commercial aircraft to sports equipment. \r\r\u27a2 \rFatigue properties are generally better than for the common engineering metals. Toughness is often greater, too. \r\r\u27a2 \rComposites can be designed that do not corrode like steel; this is important in automotive and other applications. \r\r\u27a2 \rWith composite materials, it is possible to achieve combinations of properties not attainable with metals, ceramics, or polymers alone. \r\r\u27a2 \rBetter appearance and control of surface smoothness are possible with certain composite materials. \r\r\rAlong with the advantages, there are disadvantages and limitations associated with composite materials. These include: (1) properties of many important composites are anisotropic, which means the properties differ depending on the direction in which they are measured; (2) many of the polymer-based composites are subject to attack by chemicals or solvents, just as the polymers themselves are susceptible to attack; (3) composite materials are generally expensive, although prices may drop as volume increases; and (4) certain of the manufacturing methods for shaping composite materials are slow and costly. \r\rSeveral composite materials have already been encountered in the coverage of the three other material types. Examples include cemented carbides (tungsten carbide with cobalt binder); plastic molding compounds that contain \ufb01llers (e.g., cellulose \ufb01bers,wood \ufb02our);and rubber mixed with carbon black.These materials are not always identi\ufb01ed as composites; however, technically, they \ufb01t the above de\ufb01nition. It could even be argued that a two-phase metal alloy (e.g., Fe  Fe3C) is a composite material, although it is not classi\ufb01ed as such. Perhaps the most important composite material of all is wood. \rIn discussing composite materials, the appropriate starting point is their technology and classi\ufb01cation. There are many different materials and structures that can be used to form composites. The various categories are discussed here, devoting the most time to \ufb01ber-reinforced plastics, which are commercially the most important type. \r\r\r\r\r\rTechnology and Classi\ufb01cation of Composite Materials \rAs noted in the de\ufb01nition, a composite material consists of two or more distinct phases.

Traditional composites are those that occur in nature or have been produced by civilizations for many years. Wood is a naturally occurring composite material, while concrete (Portland cement plus sand or gravel) and asphalt mixed with gravel are traditional composites used in construction. Synthetic composites are modern material systems normally associated with the manufacturing industries, in which the components are \ufb01rst produced separately and then combined in a controlled way to achieve the desired structure,properties,and part geometry.These synthetic materials are the composites normally thought of in the context of engineered products, and this chapter is focused on these materials. \r\r9.1.1 COMPONENTS IN A COMPOSITE MATERIAL \rIn its simplest form, a composite material consists of two phases: a primary phase and a secondary phase. The primary phase is the matrix within which the secondary phase is imbedded. The imbedded phase is sometimes referred to as a reinforcing agent (or similar term), because it usually serves to strengthen the composite. The reinforcing phase may be in the form of \ufb01bers, particles, or various other geometries. The phases are generally insoluble in each other, but strong adhesion must exist at their interface(s). \rThe matrix phase can be any of three basic material types: polymers, metals, or ceramics. The secondary phase may also be one of the three basic materials, or \r\rTABLE \u2022 9.1 Possible combinations of two-component composite materials. \r\rNA  not applicable currently. aCermets include cemented carbides. \r\rit may be an element such as carbon or boron. Possible combinations in a two-component composite material can be organized as a 3  4 chart, as in Table 9.1. Note that certain combinations are not feasible, such as a polymer in a ceramic matrix. Also note that the possibilities include two-phase structures consisting of components of the same material type, such as \ufb01bers of Kevlar (polymer) in a plastic (polymer) matrix. In other composites the imbedded material is an element such as carbon or boron. \rThe classi\ufb01cation system for composite materials used in this book is based on the matrix phase. The classes are listed here and discussed in Sections 9.2 through 9.4: \r1. \rMetal Matrix Composites (MMCs) include mixtures of ceramics and metals, such as cemented carbides and other cermets, as well as aluminum or magnesium reinforced by strong, high stiffness \ufb01bers. \r\r2. \rCeramic Matrix Composites (CMCs) are the least common category. Aluminum oxide and silicon carbide are materials that can be imbedded with \ufb01bers for improved properties, especially in high temperature applications. \r\r3. \rPolymer Matrix Composites (PMCs).Thermosetting resins are the most widely used polymers in PMCs. Epoxy and polyester are commonly mixed with \ufb01ber reinforcement, and phenolic is mixed with powders. Thermoplastic molding compounds are often reinforced, usually with powders (Section 8.1.5). \r\r\rThe classi\ufb01cation can be applied to traditional composites as well as synthetics.

The imbedded phase is most commonly one of the shapes illustrated in Figure 9.1: \ufb01bers, particles, or \ufb02akes. In addition, the secondary phase can take the form of an in\ufb01ltrated phase in a skeletal or porous matrix. \rFibers Fibers are \ufb01laments of reinforcing material, generally circular in cross-section, although alternative shapes are sometimes used (e.g., tubular, rectangular, hexagonal). Diameters range from less than 0.0025 mm (0.0001 in) to about 0.13 mm \r(0.005 in), depending on material. \rFiber reinforcement provides the greatest opportunity for strength enhancement of composite structures. In \ufb01ber-reinforced composites, the \ufb01ber is often considered to be the principal constituent since it bears the major share of the load. Fibers are of interest as reinforcing agents because the \ufb01lament form of most materials is signi\ufb01 cantly stronger than the bulk form. The effect of \ufb01ber diameter on tensile strength can be seen in Figure 9.2. As diameter is reduced, the material becomes oriented in the direction of the \ufb01ber axis and the probability of defects in the structure decreases signi\ufb01cantly. As a result, tensile strength increases dramatically. \rFibers used in composites can be either continuous or discontinuous. Continuous \ufb01 bers are very long; in theory, they offer a continuous path by which a load can be carried by the composite part. In reality, this is dif\ufb01 cult to achieve due to variations in the \ufb01brous material and processing. Discontinuous \ufb01 bers (chopped sections of continuous \ufb01bers) are short lengths (L/D  100). An important type of discontinuous \ufb01 ber are whiskers\u2014hair-like single crystals with diameters down to about 0.001 mm (0.00004 in) and very high strength. \rFiber diameter, in. 0.0003 0.0004 0.0005 \r3000 \r\r0.006 0.008 \r400 \r2500 \r300 \r2000 \rTensile strength, 1000 lb/in.2 Tensile strength, MPa \rFIGURE 9.2 Relationshipbetween tensile strength anddiameter for a carbon \ufb01ber \r1500 \r200 \r(Source: [1]).

Other metals are currently less common as reinforcing \ufb01bers. \r\r\rParticles and Flakes A second common shape of the imbedded phase is particulate, ranging in size from microscopic to macroscopic. Particles are an important material form for metals and ceramics.The characterization and production of engineering powders are discussed in Chapters 15 and 16. \rThe distribution of particles in the composite matrix is random, and therefore strength and other properties of the composite material are usually isotropic. The strengthening mechanism depends on particle size. The microscopic size is represented by very \ufb01ne powders (around 1 mm) distributed in the matrix in concentrations of 15% or less. The presence of these powders results in dispersion-hardening of the matrix, in which dislocation movement in the matrix material is restricted by the microscopic particles. In effect, the matrix itself is strengthened, and no signi\ufb01 cant portion of the applied load is carried by the particles. \rAs particle size increases to the macroscopic range, and the proportion of imbedded material increases to 25% and more, the strengthening mechanism changes. In this case, the applied load is shared between the matrix and the imbedded phase. Strengthening occurs due to the load-carrying ability of the particles and the bonding of particles in the matrix. This form of composite strengthening occurs in cemented carbides,in which tungsten carbide (WC) is held in a cobalt (Co) binder.The proportion of WC in the Co matrix is typically 80% or more. \rFlakes are basically two-dimensional particles\u2014small \ufb02at platelets.Two examples of this shape are the minerals mica (silicate of K and Al) and talc (Mg3Si4O10(OH)2), used as reinforcing agents in plastics.

In this case, the imbedded phase assumes the shape of the pores in the matrix. Metallic \ufb01llers are sometimes used to in\ufb01ltrate the open porous structure of parts made by powder metallurgy techniques (Section 15.3.4), in effect creating a composite material. Oil-impregnated sintered PM components, such as bearings and gears, might be considered another example of this category. \r\r\rFIGURE 9.4 Interfaces and interphases between phases in a composite material: (a) direct bonding betweenprimary and secondary phases; (b) addition of a third ingredient to bond the primary and secondary phases and forman interphase; and (c) formation of an interphase by solution of the primary and secondary phases at their boundary. \rThe Interface There is always an interface between constituent phases in a composite material. For the composite to operate effectively, the phases must bond where they join. In some cases, there is a direct bonding between the two ingredients, as suggested by Figure 9.4(a). In other cases, a third ingredient is added to promote bonding of the two primary phases. Called an interphase, this third ingredient can be thought of as an adhesive. An important example is the coating of glass \ufb01bers to achieve adhesion with thermosetting resin in \ufb01berglass-reinforced plastics. As illustrated in Figure 9.4(b), this case results in two interfaces, one on either boundary of the interphase. Finally, a third form of interface occurs when the two primary components are not completely insoluble in each other; in this case, the interphase is formed consisting of a solution of the phases, as in Figure 9.4(c). An example occurs in cemented carbides (Section 9.2.1); at the high sintering temperatures used on these materials, some solubility results at the boundaries to create an interphase. \r\r9.1.3 PROPERTIES OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS \rIn the selection of a composite material, an optimum combination of properties is usually being sought, rather than one particular property. For example, the fuselage and wings of an aircraft must be lightweight as well as strong, stiff, and tough. Finding a monolithic material that satis\ufb01es these requirements is dif\ufb01cult. Several \ufb01ber-reinforced polymers possess this combination of properties. \rAnother example is rubber. Natural rubber is a relatively weak material. In the early 1900s, it was discovered that by adding signi\ufb01cant amounts of carbon black (almost pure carbon) to natural rubber, its strength is increased dramatically. The two ingredients interact to provide a composite material that is signi\ufb01 cantly stronger than either one alone. Rubber, of course, must also be vulcanized to achieve full strength. \rRubber itself is a useful additive in polystyrene (PS). One of the distinctive and disadvantageous properties of polystyrene is its brittleness. Although most other polymers have considerable ductility, PS has virtually none.

Certain properties of a composite material can be computed by means of a rule of mixtures, which involves calculating a weighted average of the constituent material properties. Density is an example of this averaging rule. The mass of a composite material is the sum of the masses of the matrix and reinforcing phases:\r mc  mm  mr (9.1) \rwhere m # mass, kg (lb); and the subscripts c, m, and r indicate composite, matrix, and reinforcing phases, respectively. Similarly, the volume of the composite is the sum of its constituents: \rVc  Vm  Vr  V y (9.2) \rwhere V # volume, cm3 (in3). Vv is the volume of any voids in the composite (e.g., pores). The density of the composite is the mass divided by the volume. \r___ mc mm ! mr \rrc # (9.3)\rVc Vc \rBecause the masses of the matrix and reinforcing phase are their respective densities multiplied by their volumes, \rmm # rm Vm and mr # rr Vr \rthese terms can be substituted into Equation (9.3) so that \rrc  fm rm  fr rr (9.4) \rwhere fm # Vm Vc a nd fr # Vr Vc are simply the volume fractions of the matrix and reinforcing phases. \rFiber-Reinforced Composites Determining mechanical properties of composites from constituent properties is usually more involved. The rule of mixtures can sometimes be used to estimate the modulus of elasticity of a \ufb01ber-reinforced composite made of continuous \ufb01bers where Ec is measured in the longitudinal direction. The situation is depicted in Figure 9.5(a); it is assumed that the \ufb01ber material is much stiffer than the matrix and that the bonding between the two phases is secure. Under this model, the modulus of the composite can be predicted as follows: \rEc  fm Em  fr Er (9.5) \r\r\rFIGURE 9.5 (a) Model of a \ufb01ber-reinforced composite material showing direction in which elastic modulus is being estimated by the rule of mixtures. (b) Stress\u2013strain relationships for the composite material and its constituents. The \ufb01ber is stiff but brittle, while the matrix (commonly a polymer) is soft but ductile.

However, applications of \ufb01bers are limited by surface \ufb02aws, buckling when subjected to compression, and the inconvenience of the \ufb01lament geometry when a solid component is needed. By imbedding the \ufb01bers in a polymer matrix, a composite material is obtained that avoids the problems of \ufb01bers but utilizes their strengths. The matrix provides the bulk shape to protect the \ufb01ber surfaces and resist buckling; and the \ufb01bers lend their high strength to the composite. When a load is applied, the low-strength matrix deforms and distributes the stress to the high-strength \ufb01bers, which then carry the load. If individual \ufb01bers break, the load is redistributed through the matrix to other \ufb01bers. \r\r\r9.1.4 OTHER COMPOSITE STRUCTURES \rFIGURE 9.7 Laminar composite structures:\r(a)\r conventional laminar structure; \r\r(b)\r sandwich structure using a foam core,and (c) honeycombsandwich structure. \r\r\rThe model of a composite material described above is one in which a reinforcing phase is imbedded in a matrix phase, the combination having properties that are superior in certain respects to either of the constituents alone. However, composites can take alternative forms that do not \ufb01t this model, some of which are of considerable commercial and technological importance. \rA laminar composite structure consists of two or more layers bonded together to form an integral piece, as in Figure 9.7(a).

Common reinforcing phases include (1) particles of ceramic and (2) \ufb01bers of various materials, including other metals, ceramics, carbon, and boron. MMCs of the \ufb01rst type are commonly called cermets. \r9.2.1 CERMETS \r\rA cermet1 is a composite material in which a ceramic is contained in a metallic ma-trix.The ceramic often dominates the mixture,sometimes ranging up to 96% by volume. Bonding can be enhanced by slight solubility between phases at the elevated temperatures used in processing these composites. Cermets can be subdivided into \r(1) cemented carbides and (2) oxide-based cermets. \rCemented Carbides Cemented carbides are composed of one or more carbide compounds bonded in a metallic matrix. The term cermet is not used for all of these materials, even though it is technically correct. The common cemented carbides are based on tungsten carbide (WC), titanium carbide (TiC), and chromium carbide (Cr3C2). Tantalum carbide (TaC) and others are also used but less commonly. The principal metallic binders are cobalt and nickel. The carbide ceramics (Section 7.3.2) are the principal ingredient in cemented carbides, typically ranging in content from 80% to 95% of total weight. \rCemented carbide parts are produced by particulate processing techniques (Section 16.3). Cobalt is the binder used for WC (see Figure 9.8), and nickel is a common binder for TiC and Cr3C2. Even though the binder constitutes only about 5% to 15%, its effect on mechanical properties is signi\ufb01cant in the composite \r1The word \u201ccermet\u201d was \ufb01rst used in the English language around 1948. \r\rFIGURE 9.8 \rPhotomicrograph(about 1500X) ofcemented carbide with 85% WC and 15% Co.

Relative proportions of the two phases vary signi\ufb01cantly, with the possibility for the metal binder to be the major ingredient. Applications include cutting tools, mechanical seals, and thermocouple shields. \r\r9.2.2 FIBER-REINFORCED METAL MATRIX COMPOSITES \r\r\rThese MMCs are of interest because they combine the high tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of a \ufb01ber with metals of low density, thus achieving good strength-to-weight and modulus-to-weight ratios in the resulting composite material. Typical metals used as the low-density matrix are aluminum, magnesium, and titanium. Some of the important \ufb01ber materials used in the composite include Al2O3, boron, carbon, and SiC. \rProperties of \ufb01ber-reinforced MMCs are anisotropic, as expected. Maximum tensile strength in the preferred direction is obtained by using continuous \ufb01bers bonded strongly to the matrix metal. Elastic modulus and tensile strength of the composite material increase with increasing \ufb01ber volume. MMCs with \ufb01ber reinforcement have good high-temperature strength properties; and they are good electrical and thermal conductors. Applications have largely been components in aircraft and turbine machinery, where these properties can be exploited. \r\r\rCeramic Matrix Composites \rCeramics have certain attractive properties: high stiffness, hardness, hot hardness, and compressive strength; and relatively low density. Ceramics also have several faults: low toughness and bulk tensile strength, and susceptibility to thermal cracking. Ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) represent an attempt to retain the desirable properties of ceramics while compensating for their weaknesses. CMCs consist of a ceramic primary phase imbedded with a secondary phase. To date, most development work has focused on the use of \ufb01bers as the secondary phase. Success has been elusive. Technical dif\ufb01culties include thermal and chemical compatibility of the constituents in CMCs during processing. Also, as with any ceramic material, limitations on part geometry must be considered. \rCeramic materials used as matrices include alumina (Al2O3), boron carbide (B4C), boron nitride (BN), silicon carbide (SiC), silicon nitride (Si3N4), titanium carbide (TiC), and several types of glass [10]. Some of these materials are still in the development stage as CMC matrices. Fiber materials in CMCs include carbon, SiC, and Al2O3. \rFIGURE 9.10 Highlymagni\ufb01ed electron microscopy photograph (about 3000X) showingfracture surface of SiC whisker reinforced ceramic (Al2O3) used ascutting tool material.(Courtesy of GreenleafCorporation.)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 26114, "end_char_idx": 30251, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0125471d-9d2d-423d-bef1-52ee8eed1608": {"__data__": {"id_": "0125471d-9d2d-423d-bef1-52ee8eed1608", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec9.txt", "file_name": "sec9.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38968, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4b54367c-6b28-4f80-a91a-2905bcebc90c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec9.txt", "file_name": "sec9.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38968, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "052f775b4a6c2a9efe2d4749d212542b1ae089336a3eeb590787494a825a361d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd8883e2-a211-45b1-9f97-e5f78c9e4960", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/zihan/Desktop/Manufacturing_QA/Experimental_and_Test/GraphRag/input/sec9.txt", "file_name": "sec9.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 38968, "creation_date": "2024-08-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-16"}, "hash": "be8954386426db40df90e9fa0dccf698175d816f0c7a904bb5fd321385442b2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fbf86230-6c27-4103-a8dc-d947f59a0e1c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1d5f09823c5594a414a790a79ff6b9a2ad980e312f1bc8e2283f539eccb71c29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Also, as with any ceramic material, limitations on part geometry must be considered. \rCeramic materials used as matrices include alumina (Al2O3), boron carbide (B4C), boron nitride (BN), silicon carbide (SiC), silicon nitride (Si3N4), titanium carbide (TiC), and several types of glass [10].

Products with short \ufb01bers have been successfully fabricated using particulate processing methods, the \ufb01bers being treated as a form of powder in these materials.Although there are performance advantages in using long \ufb01bers as reinforcement in ceramic matrix composites, development of economical processing techniques for these materials has been dif\ufb01cult. One promising commercial application of CMCs is in metal-cutting tools as a competitor of cemented carbides, illustrated in Figure 9.10. The composite tool material has whiskers of SiC in a matrix of Al2O3. Other potential applications are in elevated temperatures and environments that are chemically corrosive to other materials. \r\r\rPolymer Matrix Composites \rA polymer matrix composite (PMC) consists of a polymer primary phase in which a secondary phase is imbedded in the form of \ufb01bers, particles, or \ufb02akes. Commercially, PMCs are the most important of the three classes of synthetic composites. They include most plastic molding compounds, rubber reinforced with carbon black, and \ufb01ber-reinforced polymers (FRPs). Of the three, FRPs are most closely identi\ufb01ed with the term composite. If one mentions \u201ccomposite material\u201d to a design engineer, FRP is usually the composite that comes to mind. \r\r9.4.1 FIBER-REINFORCED POLYMERS \rA \ufb01 ber-reinforced polymer is a composite material consisting of a polymer matrix imbedded with high-strength \ufb01bers. The polymer matrix is usually a thermosetting plastic such as unsaturated polyester or epoxy, but thermoplastic polymers, such as nylons (polyamides), polycarbonate, polystyrene, and polyvinylchloride, are also used. In addition, elastomers are also reinforced by \ufb01bers for rubber products such as tires and conveyor belts. \rFibers in PMCs come in various forms: discontinuous (chopped), continuous, or woven as a fabric. Principal \ufb01 ber materials in FRPs are glass, carbon, and Kevlar 49. Less common \ufb01bers include boron, SiC, and Al2O3, and steel. Glass (in particular E-glass) is the most common \ufb01ber material in today\u2019s FRPs; its use to reinforce plastics dates from around 1920. \r\rThe term advanced composites is sometimes used in connection with FRPs developed since the late 1960s that use boron, carbon, or Kevlar, as the reinforcing \ufb01bers [13]. Epoxy is the common matrix polymer. These composites generally have high \ufb01ber content (% 50% by volume) and possess high strength and modulus of elasticity. When two or more \ufb01ber materials are combined in the FRP composite, it is called a hybrid composite. Advantages cited for hybrids over conventional or advanced FRPs include balanced strength and stiffness, improved toughness and impact resistance, and reduced weight [11].

Advantages cited for hybrids over conventional or advanced FRPs include balanced strength and stiffness, improved toughness and impact resistance, and reduced weight [11]. Advanced and hybrid composites are used in aerospace applications. \rThe most widely used form of the FRP itself is a laminar structure,made by stacking and bonding thin layers of \ufb01ber and polymer until the desired thickness is obtained. By varying the \ufb01ber orientation among the layers, a speci\ufb01ed level of anisotropy in properties can be achieved in the laminate. This method is used to form parts of thin cross section, such as aircraft wing and fuselage sections, automobile and truck body panels, and boat hulls. \rProperties There are a number of attractive features that distinguish \ufb01ber-reinforced plastics as engineering materials. Most notable are (1) high strength-to-weight ratio, \r(2) high modulus-to-weight ratio, and (3) low speci\ufb01c gravity. A typical FRP weighs only about one \ufb01fth as much as steel; yet strength and modulus are comparable in the \ufb01ber direction. Table 9.4 compares these properties for several FRPs, steels, and an aluminum alloy. Properties listed in Table 9.4 depend on the proportion of \ufb01bers in the composite. Both tensile strength and elastic modulus increase as the \ufb01ber content is increased, by Equation (9.5). Other properties and characteristics of \ufb01ber-reinforced plastics include (4) good fatigue strength; (5) good corrosion resistance, although polymers are soluble in various chemicals; (6) low thermal expansion for many FRPs, leading to good dimensional stability;and (7) signi\ufb01cant anisotropy in properties.With regard to this last feature, the mechanical properties of the FRPs given in Table 9.4 are \rTABLE \u2022 9.4 Comparison of typical properties of \ufb01ber-reinforced plastics and representative metal alloys. \r\rCompiled from [3], [7], and other sources. Properties are measured in the \ufb01ber direction. aIndices are relative tensile strength-to-weight (TS/SG) and elastic modulus-to-weight (E/SG) ratios compared to low-C steel as the base (index  1.0 for the base). bHigh tensile strength carbon \ufb01bers used in FRP. cHigh modulus carbon \ufb01bers used in FRP. \rin the direction of the \ufb01ber.As previously noted,their values are signi\ufb01cantly less when measured in a different direction. \rApplications During the last three decades there has been a steady growth in the application of \ufb01ber-reinforced polymers in products requiring high strength and low weight, often as substitutions for metals. The aerospace industry is one of the biggest users of advanced composites. Designers are continually striving to reduce aircraft weight to increase fuel ef\ufb01ciency and payload capacity. Applications of advanced composites in both military and commercial aircraft have increased steadily. Much of the structural weight of today\u2019s airplanes and helicopters consists of FRPs. The new Boeing 787 Dreamliner features 50% (by weight) composite (carbon \ufb01ber-reinforced plastic). That\u2019s about 80% of the volume of the aircraft. Composites are used for the fuselage, wings, tail, doors, and interior. By comparison, Boeing\u2019s 777 has only about 12% composites (by weight). \rThe automotive industry is another important user of FRPs. The most obvious applications are FRP body panels for cars and truck cabs. A notable example is the Chevrolet Corvette that has been produced with FRP bodies for decades. Less apparent applications are in certain chassis and engine parts. Automotive applications differ from those in aerospace in two signi\ufb01cant respects. First, the requirement for high strength-to-weight ratio is less demanding than for aircraft. Car and truck applications can use conventional \ufb01berglass reinforced plastics rather than advanced composites. Second, production quantities are much higher in automotive applications, requiring more economical methods of fabrication. Continued use of low-carbon sheet steel in automobiles in the face of FRP\u2019s advantages is evidence of the low cost and processability of steel. \rFRPs have been widely adopted for sports and recreational equipment.

Ingredients of the secondary phase are called \ufb01 llers when used in polymer molding compounds (Section 8.1.5).Fillers divide into two categories:(1) reinforcements and (2) extenders. Reinforcing \ufb01 llers serve to strengthen or otherwise improve mechanical properties of the polymer. Common examples include: wood \ufb02our and powdered mica in phenolic and amino resins to increase strength, abrasion resistance, and dimensional stability; and carbon black in rubber to improve strength, wear, and tear resistance. Extenders simply increase the bulk and reduce the cost-per-unit weight of the polymer, but have little or no effect on mechanical properties. Extenders may be formulated to improve molding characteristics of the resin. \rFoamed polymers (Section 13.11) are a form of composite in which gas bubbles are imbedded in a polymer matrix. Styrofoam and polyurethane foam are the most common examples. The combination of near-zero density of the gas and relatively low density of the matrix makes these materials extremely light weight.The gas mixture also lends very low thermal conductivity for applications in which heat insulation is required.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 36116, "end_char_idx": 38537, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template":

      "highest ductility, if the number of slip directions were the only criterion. However, \n",
      "nature is not so simple. These metals are generally stronger than the others, which \n",
      "complicates the issue, and the BCC metals usually require higher stresses to cause \n",
      "slip. In fact, some of the BCC metals exhibit poor ductility. Low carbon steel is a \n",

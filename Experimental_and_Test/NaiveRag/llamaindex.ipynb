Today, the \\nterm manufacturing is used for this activity. For techno- \\nlogical and economic reasons, manufacturing is impor- \\ntant to the welfare of the United States and most other \\ndeveloped and developing nations. Technology can be \\ndefined as the application of science to provide society \\nand its members with those things that are needed or \\ndesired. Technology affects our daily lives, directly and \\nindirectly, in many ways. Consider the list of products in \\nTable 1.1. They represent various technologies that help our \\nsociety and its members to live better. What do all these \\nproducts have in common? They are all manufac- tured. \\nThese technological wonders would not be avail- able to \\nour society if they could not be manufactured. \\nManufacturing is the critical factor that makes technol- \\nogy possible. \\nEconomically, manufacturing is an important means \\nby which a nation creates material wealth. In the Unit- \\ned States, the manufacturing industries account for \\nonly about 12% of gross domestic product (GDP). A \\ncountry’s natural resources, such as agricultural lands, \\nmineral deposits, and oil reserves, also create wealth. \\nIn the U.S., agriculture, mining, and similar industries \\naccount for less than 5% of GDP (agriculture alone is \\nonly about 1%). Construction and public utilities make \\nup around 5%. The rest is service industries, which in- \\nclude retail, transportation, banking, communication, \\neducation, and government. The service sector ac- \\ncounts for more than 75% of U.S. GDP. Government \\n(federal, state, and local) accounts for more of GDP \\nthan the manufacturing sector; however, government \\nservices do not create wealth. In the modern global \\neconomy, a nation must have a strong manufacturing \\nbase (or it must have significant natural resources) if it \\nis to provide a strong economy and a high standard of \\nliving for its people. \\n1 \\n1 \\nSection 1.1/What Is Manufacturing? \\n2 \\n \\n \\nTABLE • 1.1 Products representing various technologies, most of which affect nearly all of us. \\n \\nAthletic shoes \\nE-book reader \\nOne-piece molded plastic patio chair \\nAutomatic teller machine \\nFax machine \\nOptical scanner \\nAutomatic dishwasher \\nHand-held electronic calculator \\nPersonal computer (PC) \\nBallpoint pen \\nHigh density PC diskette \\nPhotocopying machine \\nCamcorder \\nHome security system \\nPull-tab beverage cans \\nCell phone \\nHybrid gas-electric automobile \\nQuartz crystal wrist watch \\nCompact disc (CD) \\nIndustrial robot \\nSelf-propelled mulching lawnmower \\nCompact disc player \\nInk-jet color printer \\nSmart phone \\nCompact fluorescent light bulb \\nLCD and Plasma TVs \\nSupersonic aircraft \\nContact lenses \\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \\nTablet computer \\nDigital camera \\nmachine for medical diagnosis \\nTennis racket of composite materials \\nDigital video disc (DVD) \\nMedicines \\nVideo games \\nDigital video disc player \\nMicrowave oven \\nWashing machine and dryer \\n \\n \\nThis opening chapter considers some general topics about manufacturing. What is \\nmanufacturing? How is it organized in industry? What are the materials, processes, \\nand systems by which it is accomplished? \\n \\nWhat Is Manufacturing? \\nThe word manufacture is derived from two Latin words, manus (hand) and factus \\n(make); the combination means made by hand. The English word manufacture is \\nseveral centuries old, and “made by hand” accurately described the manual methods \\nused when the word was first coined.1 Most modern manufacturing is accomplished \\nby automated and computer-controlled machinery (Historical Note 1.1). \\n \\n \\n \\n1As a noun, the word manufacture first appeared in English around 1567 A.D. As a verb, it first appeared \\naround 1683 A.D. \\n. \\n \\nThe history of manufacturing can be separated into  weapons, scrolls, pottery and glassware, and other \\ntwo subjects: (1) the discovery and invention of mate-  products of the time, but the procedures were largely \\nrials and processes to make things, and (2) the devel-  based on handicraft. \\nopment of the systems of production. The materials   The systems aspects of manufacturing are examined \\nand processes to make things predate the systems  here, and the materials and processes are discussed in \\nby several millennia. Some of the processes—casting, Historical Note 1.2.

The ancient as having had a major impact on the development of Romans \\nhad what might be called factories to produce  modern manufacturing systems. \\nSection 1.1/What Is Manufacturing? \\n3 \\n \\n \\n \\nCertainly one significant discovery was the principle \\nof division of labor—dividing the total work into tasks \\nand having individual workers each become a special- \\nist at performing only one task. This principle had been \\npracticed for centuries, but the economist Adam Smith \\n(1723–1790) is credited with first explaining its eco- \\nnomic significance in The Wealth of Nations. \\nThe Industrial Revolution (circa 1760–1830) had \\na major impact on production in several ways. It \\nmarked the change from an economy based on agri- \\nculture and handicraft to one based on industry and \\nmanufacturing. The change began in England, where a \\nseries of machines were invented and steam power \\nreplaced water, wind, and animal power. These ad- \\nvances gave British industry significant advantages \\nover other nations, and England attempted to restrict \\nexport of the new technologies. However, the revo- \\nlution eventually spread to other European countries \\nand the United States. Several inventions of the Indus- \\ntrial Revolution greatly contributed to the development \\nof manufacturing: (1) Watt’s steam engine—a new \\npower-generating technology for industry; (2) machine \\ntools, starting with John Wilkinson’s boring machine \\naround 1775 (Historical Note 21.1); (3) the spinning \\njenny, power loom, and other machinery for the tex- \\ntile industry that permitted significant increases in \\nproductivity; and (4) the factory system—a new way \\nof organizing large numbers of production workers \\nbased on division of labor. \\nWhile England was leading the industrial revolu- \\ntion, an important concept was being introduced in the \\nUnited States: interchangeable parts manufacture. \\nMuch credit for this concept is given to Eli Whitney \\n(1765–1825), although its importance had been rec- \\nognized by others [10]. In 1797, Whitney negotiated \\na contract to produce 10,000 muskets for the U.S. \\ngovernment. The traditional way of making guns at the \\ntime was to custom-fabricate each part for a par- ticular \\ngun and then hand-fit the parts together by fil- ing. \\nEach musket was unique, and the time to make it was \\nconsiderable. Whitney believed that the com- ponents \\ncould be made accurately enough to permit parts \\nassembly without fitting. After several years of \\ndevelopment in his Connecticut factory, he traveled to \\nWashington in 1801 to demonstrate the principle. \\nHe laid out components for 10 muskets before gov- \\nernment officials, including Thomas Jefferson, and \\nproceeded to select parts randomly to assemble the \\nguns. No special filing or fitting was required, and \\nall of the guns worked perfectly. The secret be- hind his \\nachievement was the collection of special machines, \\nfixtures, and gages that he had developed in \\nhis \\nfactory. Interchangeable parts manufacture \\nrequired many years of development before becom- \\ning a practical reality, but it revolutionized methods of \\nmanufacturing. It is a prerequisite for mass produc- \\ntion. Because its origins were in the United States, \\ninterchangeable parts production came to be known as \\nthe American System of manufacture. \\nThe mid- and late 1800s witnessed the expan- sion \\nof railroads, steam-powered ships, and other machines \\nthat created a growing need for iron and steel. New \\nsteel production methods were devel- oped to meet \\nthis demand (Historical Note 6.1). Also during this \\nperiod, several consumer products were developed, \\nincluding \\nthe \\nsewing \\nmachine, \\nbicycle, \\nand \\nautomobile. To meet the mass demand for these \\nproducts, more efficient production methods were \\nrequired. Some historians identify developments dur- \\ning this period as the Second Industrial Revolution, \\ncharacterized in terms of its effects on manufacturing \\nsystems by (1) mass production, (2) scientific manage- \\nment movement, (3) assembly lines, and (4) electrifi- \\ncation of factories. \\nIn the late 1800s, the scientific management \\nmovement was developing in the United States in \\nresponse to the need to plan and control the activi- ties \\nof growing numbers of production workers. The \\nmovement’s leaders included Frederick W. Taylor \\n(1856–1915), Frank Gilbreth (1868–1924), and his wife \\nLillian (1878–1972). Scientific management included \\nseveral features [3]: (1) motion study, aimed at find- \\ning the best method to perform a given task; (2) time \\nstudy, to establish work standards for a job; (3) exten- \\nsive use of standards in industry; (4) the piece rate \\nsystem and similar labor incentive plans; and (5) use \\nof data collection, record keeping, and cost account- \\ning in factory operations. \\nHenry Ford (1863–1947) introduced the assembly \\nline in 1913 at his Highland Park, Michigan plant. The \\nassembly line made possible the mass production of \\ncomplex consumer products. Use of assembly line \\nmethods permitted Ford to sell a Model T automobile \\nfor as little as $500, thus making ownership of cars \\nfeasible for a large segment of the U.S. population. \\nIn 1881, the first electric power generating station \\nhad been built in New York City, and soon electric mo- \\ntors were being used as a power source to operate fac- \\ntory machinery. This was a far more convenient power \\ndelivery system than steam engines, which required \\noverhead belts to distribute power to the machines. By \\n1920, electricity had overtaken steam as the principal \\npower source in U.S. factories. The twentieth century \\nwas a time of more technological advances than in all \\nother centuries combined. Many of these develop- \\nments resulted in the automation of manufacturing. \\nSection 1.1/What Is Manufacturing? \\n4 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nScrap and \\nwaste \\nManufacturing \\nprocess \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nStarting \\nmaterial \\nProcessed \\npart \\n$ \\n \\n$$$ \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nStarting \\nmaterial \\nMaterial in \\nprocessing \\nProcessed \\npart \\n \\n(a) \\n(b) \\n \\nFIGURE 1.1  Two ways to define manufacturing: (a) as a technical process, and (b) as an economic process. \\n \\n \\n1.1.1 MANUFACTURING DEFINED \\n \\nAs a field of study in the modern context, manufacturing can be defined two ways, \\none technologic, and the other economic. Technologically, manufacturing is the ap- \\nplication of physical and chemical processes to alter the geometry, properties, and/ \\nor appearance of a given starting material to make parts or products; manufacturing \\nalso includes assembly of multiple parts to make products. The processes to accom- \\nplish manufacturing involve a combination of machinery, tools, power, and labor, as \\ndepicted in Figure 1.1(a). Manufacturing is almost always carried out as a sequence \\nof operations. Each operation brings the material closer to the desired final state. \\nEconomically, manufacturing is the transformation of materials into items of \\ngreater value by means of one or more processing and/or assembly operations, as \\ndepicted in Figure 1.1(b). The key point is that manufacturing adds value to the \\nmaterial by changing its shape or properties, or by combining it with other materials \\nthat have been similarly altered. The material has been made more valuable through \\nthe manufacturing operations performed on it. When iron ore is converted into steel, value \\nis added. When sand is transformed into glass, value is added. When petroleum is \\nrefined into plastic, value is added. And when plastic is molded into the complex \\ngeometry of a patio chair, it is made even more valuable. \\nFigure 1.2 shows a product on the left and the starting workpiece from which the \\ncircular frame of the product was produced on the right. The starting workpiece is \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 1.2 A mechanical \\nheart value on the left and the \\ntitanium workpiece from which \\nthe frame is machined on the \\nright.

The product is an artificial heart valve \\ncosting thousands of dollars, well worth it for patients who need one. (By the way, \\nthe surgeon who installs it charges several more thousand dollars.) The titanium \\nbillet costs a small fraction of the selling price. It measures about 25 mm (1 in) \\nin diameter. The frame was machined (a material removal process, Section 1.3.1) \\nfrom the starting billet. Machining time was about one hour. Note the added value \\nprovided by this operation. Note also the waste in the unit operation, as depicted in \\nFigure 1.1(a); the finished frame has only about 5% of the mass of the starting \\nworkpiece (although the titanium swarf can be recycled). \\nThe words manufacturing and production are often used interchangeably. The \\nauthor’s view is that production has a broader meaning than manufacturing. To illus- trate, \\none might speak of “crude oil production,” but the phrase “crude oil manufac- \\nturing” seems out of place. Yet when used in the context of products such as metal \\nparts or automobiles, either word seems okay. \\n \\n \\n1.1.2 MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES AND PRODUCTS \\n \\nManufacturing is an important commercial activity performed by companies that \\nsell products to customers. The type of manufacturing done by a company depends \\non the kinds of products it makes. \\n \\nManufacturing Industries \\nIndustry consists of enterprises and organizations that \\nproduce or supply goods and services. Industries can be classified as primary, second- ary, \\nor tertiary. Primary industries cultivate and exploit natural resources, such as \\nagriculture and mining. \\n \\nbut construction and power utilities are also included. \\nTertiary industries constitute the service sector of the economy. A list of specific \\nindustries in these categories is presented in Table 1.2. \\n \\nTABLE • 1.2 Specific industries in the primary, secondary, and tertiary categories. \\n \\nPrimary \\nSecondary \\nTertiary (service) \\nAgriculture \\nForestry \\nFishing \\nLivestock \\nQuarries \\nMining \\nPetroleum \\nAerospace \\nFood processing \\nApparel \\nGlass, ceramics \\nAutomotive \\nHeavy machinery \\nBasic metals \\nPaper \\nBeverages \\nPetroleum refining \\nBuilding materials \\nPharmaceuticals \\nChemicals \\nPlastics (shaping) \\nComputers \\nPower utilities \\nConstruction \\nPublishing \\nConsumer appliances \\nTextiles \\nElectronics \\nTire and rubber \\nEquipment \\nWood and furniture \\nFabricated metals \\nBanking \\nInsurance \\nCommunications \\nLegal \\nEducation \\nReal estate \\nEntertainment \\nRepair and \\nFinancial services \\nmaintenance \\nGovernment \\nRestaurant \\nHealth and medical \\nRetail trade \\nHotel \\nTourism \\nInformation \\nTransportation \\nWholesale trade \\ncipal activity in this category, \\nSecondary industries take the outputs of the primary indus- \\ntries and convert them into consumer and capital goods. Manufacturing is the prin- \\nSection 1.1/What Is Manufacturing? \\n6 \\n \\n \\nThis book is concerned with the secondary industries in Table 1.2, which include \\nthe companies engaged in manufacturing. However, the International Standard \\nIndustrial Classification (ISIC) used to compile Table 1.2 includes several industries \\nwhose production technologies are not covered in this text; for example, beverages, \\nchemicals, and food processing. In this book, manufacturing means production of \\nhardware, which ranges from nuts and bolts to digital computers and military weap- \\nons. Plastic and ceramic products are included, but apparel, paper, pharmaceuticals, \\npower utilities, publishing, and wood products are excluded. \\n \\nManufactured Products Final products made by the manufacturing industries \\ncan be divided into two major classes: consumer goods and capital goods. Consumer goods \\nare products purchased directly by consumers, such as cars, personal comput- ers, TVs, \\ntires, and tennis rackets. Capital goods are those purchased by companies to produce \\ngoods and/or provide services. Examples of capital goods include aircraft, computers, \\ncommunication equipment, medical apparatus, trucks and buses, railroad locomotives, \\nmachine tools, and construction equipment. Most of these capital goods are purchased \\nby the service industries. It was noted in the introduction that manu- facturing \\naccounts for about 12% of gross domestic product and services about 75% of GDP in \\nthe United States. Yet the manufactured capital goods purchased by the service \\nsector are the enablers of that sector. Without the capital goods, the service \\nindustries could not function. \\nIn addition to final products, other manufactured items include the materials, \\ncomponents, tools, and supplies used by the companies that make the final products. \\nExamples of these items include sheet steel, bar stock, metal stampings, machined \\nparts, plastic moldings and extrusions, cutting tools, dies, molds, and lubricants. \\nThus, the manufacturing industries consist of a complex infrastructure with vari- \\nous categories and layers of intermediate suppliers with whom the final consumer \\nnever deals. \\nThis book is generally concerned with discrete items—individual parts and \\nassembled products rather than items produced by continuous processes. A metal \\nstamping is a discrete item, but the sheet-metal coil from which it is made is continu- \\nous (almost). Many discrete parts start out as continuous or semicontinuous prod- \\nucts, such as extrusions and electrical wire. Long sections made in almost continuous \\nlengths are cut to the desired size. An oil refinery is a better example of a continuous \\nprocess. \\n \\nProduction Quantity and Product Variety The quantity of products made by a \\nfactory has an important influence on the way its people, facilities, and procedures \\nare organized. Annual production quantities can be classified into three ranges: (1) \\nlow production, quantities in the range 1 to 100 units per year; (2) medium produc- \\ntion, from 100 to 10,000 units annually; and (3) high production, 10,000 to millions \\nof units. The boundaries between the three ranges are somewhat arbitrary (author’s \\njudgment). Depending on the kinds of products, these boundaries may shift by an \\norder of magnitude or so. \\nProduction quantity refers to the number of units produced annually of a particu- \\nlar product type. Some plants produce a variety of different product types, each type being \\nmade in low or medium quantities. Other plants specialize in high production of only \\none product type. It is instructive to identify product variety as a parameter distinct \\nfrom production quantity. Product variety refers to different product designs or types \\nthat are produced in the plant. Different products have different shapes and \\nSection 1.1/What Is Manufacturing? \\n7 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 1.3 Relationship \\nbetween product variety and \\nproduction quantity in discrete \\nproduct manufacturing. \\n \\nsizes; they perform different functions; they are intended for different markets; some have \\nmore components than others; and so forth. The number of different product types \\nmade each year can be counted. When the number of product types made in the \\nfactory is high, this indicates high product variety. \\nThere is an inverse correlation between product variety and production quantity \\nin terms of factory operations. If a factory’s product variety is high, then its produc- \\ntion quantity is likely to be low; but if production quantity is high, then product vari- \\nety will be low, as depicted in Figure 1.3. Manufacturing plants tend to specialize in a \\ncombination of production quantity and product variety that lies somewhere inside \\nthe diagonal band in Figure 1.3. \\nAlthough product variety has been identified as a quantitative parameter (the \\nnumber of different product types made by the plant or company), this parameter is \\nmuch less exact than production quantity because details on how much the designs \\ndiffer are not captured simply by the number of different designs. Differences \\nbetween an automobile and an air conditioner are far greater than between an air \\nconditioner and a heat pump. Within each product type, there are differences among \\nspecific models. \\nThe extent of the product differences may be small or great, as illustrated in the \\nautomotive industry. Each of the U.S. automotive companies produces cars with two \\nor three different nameplates in the same assembly plant, although the body styles \\nand other design features are virtually the same. In different plants, the company \\nbuilds heavy trucks. The terms “soft” and “hard” might be used to describe these \\ndifferences in product variety. Soft product variety occurs when there are only small \\ndifferences among products, such as the differences among car models made on the \\nsame production line. In an assembled product, soft variety is characterized by a \\nhigh proportion of common parts among the models. Hard product variety occurs \\nwhen the products differ substantially, and there are few common parts, if any. The \\ndifference between a car and a truck exemplifies hard variety. \\n \\n \\n1.1.3 MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY \\n \\nA manufacturing plant consists of a set of processes and systems (and people, of \\ncourse) designed to transform a certain limited range of materials into products of \\nincreased value. These three building blocks—materials, processes, and systems— \\nconstitute the subject of modern manufacturing. There is a strong interdependence \\namong these factors. A company engaged in manufacturing cannot do everything. \\nSection 1.1/What Is Manufacturing? \\n8 \\n \\n \\nIt must do only certain things, and it must do those things well. Manufacturing ca- \\npability refers to the scope of technical and physical capabilities and limitations of \\na manufacturing company and each of its plants. Manufacturing capability has three \\ndimensions: (1) technological processing capability, (2) physical size and weight of \\nproduct, and (3) production capacity. \\n \\nTechnological Processing Capability The technological processing capabil- ity \\nof a plant (or company) is its available set of manufacturing processes. Certain plants \\nperform machining operations, others roll steel billets into sheet stock, and others build \\nautomobiles. A machine shop cannot roll steel, and a rolling mill can- not build cars. \\nThe underlying feature that distinguishes these plants is the processes they can \\nperform. Technological processing capability is closely related to material type. \\nCertain manufacturing processes are suited to certain materials, whereas other \\nprocesses are suited to other materials. By specializing in a certain process or group of \\nprocesses, the plant is simultaneously specializing in certain material types. Tech- \\nnological processing capability includes not only the physical processes, but also the \\nexpertise possessed by plant personnel in these processing technologies. Companies \\nmust concentrate on the design and manufacture of products that are compatible \\nwith their technological processing capability. \\n \\nPhysical Product Limitations A second aspect of manufacturing capability is \\nimposed by the physical product. A plant with a given set of processes is limited in \\nterms of the size and weight of the products that can be accommodated. Large, \\nheavy products are difficult to move. To move these products about, the plant must \\nbe equipped with cranes of the required load capacity. Smaller parts and products \\nmade in large quantities can be moved by conveyor or other means. The limitation \\non product size and weight extends to the physical capacity of the manufacturing \\nequipment as well. Production machines come in different sizes. Larger machines \\nmust be used to process larger parts. The production and material handling equip- \\nment must be planned for products that lie within a certain size and weight range. \\n \\nProduction Capacity A third limitation on a plant’s manufacturing capability \\nis the production quantity that can be produced in a given time period (e.g., month \\nor year). This quantity limitation is commonly called plant capacity, or production \\ncapacity, defined as the maximum rate of production that a plant can achieve under \\nassumed operating conditions. The operating conditions refer to number of shifts \\nper week, hours per shift, direct labor manning levels in the plant, and so on. These \\nfactors represent inputs to the manufacturing plant. Given these inputs, how much \\noutput can the factory produce? \\nPlant capacity is usually measured in terms of output units, such as annual tons of steel \\nproduced by a steel mill, or number of cars produced by a final assembly plant. In \\nthese cases, the outputs are homogeneous. In cases in which the output units are not \\nhomogeneous, other factors may be more appropriate measures, such as avail- able \\nlabor hours of productive capacity in a machine shop that produces a variety of \\nparts. \\nMaterials, processes, and systems are the basic building blocks of manufacturing \\nand the three broad subject areas of this book. This introductory chapter provides \\nan overview of these three subjects before embarking on a detailed coverage in the \\nremaining chapters. \\nSection 1.2/Materials in Manufacturing \\n9 \\n \\n \\nMaterials in Manufacturing \\nMost engineering materials can be classified into one of three basic categories: \\n(1) metals, (2) ceramics, and (3) polymers. Their chemistries are different, their \\nmechanical and physical properties are different, and these differences affect the \\nmanufacturing processes that can be used to produce products from them. In addi- \\ntion to the three basic categories, there are (4) composites—nonhomogeneous mix- \\ntures of the other three basic types rather than a unique category. The classification \\nof the four groups is pictured in Figure 1.4. This section provides a survey of these \\nmaterials. Chapters 6 through 9 cover the four material types in more detail. \\n \\n \\n1.2.1 METALS \\n \\nMetals used in manufacturing are usually alloys, which are composed of two or \\nmore elements, with at least one being a metallic element. Metals and alloys can be \\ndivided into two basic groups: (1) ferrous, and (2) nonferrous. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 1.4 \\nClassification of the \\nfour engineering \\nmaterials. \\n1.2 \\n \\nFerrous Metals \\n \\n \\n \\nMetals \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNonferrous \\nMetals \\n \\n \\n \\nCrystalline \\nCeramics \\n \\n \\n \\nCeramics \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nGlasses \\n \\nEngineering \\nMaterials \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThermoplastics \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPolymers \\n \\n \\nThermosets \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nElastomers \\n \\n \\n \\nMetal Matrix \\nComposites \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nComposites \\n \\n \\nCeramic Matrix \\nComposites \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPolymer Matrix \\nComposites \\n \\n \\nSection 1.2/Materials in Manufacturing \\n10 \\n \\n \\nFerrous Metals Ferrous metals are based on iron; the group includes steel and cast \\niron. These metals constitute the most important group commercially, more than three-\\nfourths of the metal tonnage throughout the world. Pure iron has limited com- mercial \\nuse, but when alloyed with carbon, iron has more uses and greater commer- cial value \\nthan any other metal. Alloys of iron and carbon form steel and cast iron. \\nSteel can be defined as an iron–carbon alloy containing 0.02% to 2.11% carbon. It \\nis the most important category within the ferrous metal group. Its composition often \\nincludes other alloying elements as well, such as manganese, chromium, nickel, and \\nmolybdenum, to enhance the properties of the metal. Applications of steel include \\nconstruction (bridges, I-beams, and nails), transportation (trucks, rails, and rolling \\nstock for railroads), and consumer products (automobiles and appliances). \\nCast iron is an alloy of iron and carbon (2% to 4%) used in casting (primarily \\nsand casting). Silicon is also present in the alloy (in amounts from 0.5% to 3%), and \\nother elements are often added also, to obtain desirable properties in the cast part. \\nCast iron is available in several different forms, of which gray cast iron is the most \\ncommon; its applications include blocks and heads for internal combustion engines. \\nNonferrous Metals Nonferrous metals include the other metallic elements and their \\nalloys. In almost all cases, the alloys are more important commercially than the pure \\nmetals. The nonferrous metals include the pure metals and alloys of aluminum, copper, \\ngold, magnesium, nickel, silver, tin, titanium, zinc, and other metals. \\n \\n1.2.2 CERAMICS \\n \\nA ceramic is defined as a compound containing metallic (or semimetallic) and nonme- \\ntallic elements. Typical nonmetallic elements are oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon. Ceram- \\nics include a variety of traditional and modern materials. Traditional ceramics, some of \\nwhich have been used for thousands of years, include: clay (abundantly available, con- \\nsisting of fine particles of hydrous aluminum silicates and other minerals used in mak- \\ning brick, tile, and pottery); silica (the basis for nearly all glass products); and alumina \\nand silicon carbide (two abrasive materials used in grinding). Modern ceramics include \\nsome of the preceding materials, such as alumina, whose properties are enhanced in \\nvarious ways through modern processing methods. Newer ceramics include: carbides— \\nmetal carbides such as tungsten carbide and titanium carbide, which are widely used \\nas cutting tool materials; and nitrides—metal and semimetal nitrides such as titanium \\nnitride and boron nitride, used as cutting tools and grinding abrasives. \\nFor processing purposes, ceramics can be divided into crystalline ceramics and \\nglasses. Different methods of manufacturing are required for the two types. \\nCrystalline ceramics are formed in various ways from powders and then fired (heated \\nto a temperature below the melting point to achieve bonding between the powders). \\nThe glass ceramics (namely, glass) can be melted and cast, and then formed in proc- \\nesses such as traditional glass blowing. \\n \\n1.2.3 POLYMERS \\n \\nA polymer is a compound formed of repeating structural units called mers, whose \\natoms share electrons to form very large molecules. Polymers usually consist of \\ncarbon plus one or more other elements such as hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and \\nchlorine. Polymers are divided into three categories: (1) thermoplastic polymers, \\n(2) thermosetting polymers, and (3) elastomers. \\nSection 1.3/Manufacturing Processes \\n11 \\n \\n \\nThermoplastic polymers can be subjected to multiple heating and cooling cycles \\nwithout substantially altering the molecular structure of the polymer. Common \\nthermoplastics include polyethylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, and nylon. \\nThermosetting polymers chemically transform (cure) into a rigid structure upon \\ncooling from a heated plastic condition; hence the name thermosetting. Members \\nof this type include phenolics, amino resins, and epoxies. Although the name “ther- \\nmosetting” is used, some of these polymers cure by mechanisms other than heating. \\nElastomers are polymers that exhibit significant elastic behavior; hence the name \\nelastomer. They include natural rubber, neoprene, silicone, and polyurethane. \\n \\n \\n1.2.4 COMPOSITES \\n \\nComposites do not really constitute a separate category of materials; they are mix- \\ntures of the other three types. A composite is a material consisting of two or more \\nphases that are processed separately and then bonded together to achieve proper- \\nties superior to those of its constituents. The term phase refers to a homogeneous \\nmass of material, such as an aggregation of grains of identical unit cell structure in a \\nsolid metal. The usual structure of a composite consists of particles or fibers of one \\nphase mixed in a second phase, called the matrix. \\nComposites are found in nature (e.g., wood), and they can be produced synthetically. \\nThe synthesized type is of greater interest here, and it includes glass fibers in a polymer \\nmatrix, such as fiber-reinforced plastic; polymer fibers of one type in a matrix of a sec- \\nond polymer, such as an epoxy-Kevlar composite; and ceramic in a metal matrix, such \\nas a tungsten carbide in a cobalt binder to form a cemented carbide cutting tool. \\nProperties of a composite depend on its components, the physical shapes of the \\ncomponents, and the way they are combined to form the final material. Some com- \\nposites combine high strength with light weight and are suited to applications such \\nas aircraft components, car bodies, boat hulls, tennis rackets, and fishing rods. Other \\ncomposites are strong, hard, and capable of maintaining these properties at elevated \\ntemperatures, for example, cemented carbide cutting tools. \\n \\nManufacturing Processes \\nA manufacturing process is a designed procedure that results in physical and/or \\nchemical changes to a starting work material with the intention of increasing the \\nvalue of that material. A manufacturing process is usually carried out as a unit oper- ation, \\nwhich means that it is a single step in the sequence of steps required to trans- form \\nthe starting material into a final product. Manufacturing operations can be divided \\ninto two basic types: (1) processing operations and (2) assembly operations. A \\nprocessing operation transforms a work material from one state of completion to \\na more advanced state that is closer to the final desired product. It adds value by \\nchanging the geometry, properties, or appearance of the starting material. In general, \\nprocessing operations are performed on discrete work parts, but certain processing \\noperations are also applicable to assembled items (e.g., painting a spot-welded car \\nbody). An assembly operation joins two or more components to create a new entity, \\ncalled an assembly, subassembly, or some other term that refers to the joining proc- \\ness (e.g., a welded assembly is called a weldment). A classification of manufacturing \\nprocesses is presented in Figure 1.5. Some of the basic processes used in modern \\nmanufacturing date from antiquity (Historical Note 1.2). \\n1.3 \\nSection 1.3/Manufacturing Processes \\n12 \\n \\nMaterial \\nremoval \\nSolidification \\nprocesses \\nManufacturing \\nprocesses \\nProcessing \\noperations \\nParticulate \\nprocessing \\nShaping \\nprocesses \\nAssembly \\noperations \\nCoating and \\ndeposition processes \\nDeformation \\nprocesses \\nAdhesive \\nbonding \\nBrazing and \\nsoldering \\nPermanent \\njoining processes \\nWelding \\nCleaning and \\nsurface treatments \\nSurface processing \\noperations \\nPermanent \\nfastening methods \\nMechanical \\nfastening \\nThreaded \\nfasteners \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 1.5 \\nClassification of \\nmanufacturing \\nprocesses. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nProperty \\nenhancing processes \\nHeat \\ntreatment \\nHistorical Note 1.2 \\nManufacturing materials and processes \\n \\nAlthough most of the historical developments that form  \\nGold was found by early humans in relatively pure form \\nthe modern practice of manufacturing have occurred  \\nin nature; it could be hammered into shape.

Temperatures required to \\nreduce iron ore to metal are significantly higher than for \\ncopper, which made furnace operations more difficult. \\nOther processing methods were also more difficult for \\nthe same reason. Early blacksmiths learned that when \\ncertain irons (those containing small amounts of car- \\nbon) were sufficiently heated and then quenched, \\nthey became very hard. This permitted grinding a very \\nsharp cutting edge on knives and weapons, but it also \\nmade the metal brittle. Toughness could be increased \\nby reheating at a lower temperature, a process known \\nas tempering. What we have described is, of course, \\nthe heat treatment of steel. The superior properties of \\nsteel caused it to succeed bronze in many applica- \\ntions (weaponry, agriculture, and mechanical devices). \\nThe period of its use has subsequently been named \\nthe Iron Age (starting around 1000 B.C.). It was not un- \\ntil much later, well into the nineteenth century, that the \\ndemand for steel grew significantly and more modern \\nsteelmaking techniques were developed (Historical \\nNote 6.1). \\nThe beginnings of machine tool technology oc- \\ncurred during the Industrial Revolution. During the peri- \\nod 1770–1850, machine tools were developed for most \\nof the conventional material removal processes, \\nsuch as boring, turning, drilling, milling, shaping, \\nand planing (Historical Note 21.1). Many of the individ- \\nual processes predate the machine tools by centuries; \\nfor example, drilling and sawing (of wood) date from \\nancient times, and turning (of wood) from around the \\ntime of Christ. \\nAssembly methods were used in ancient cultures to \\nmake ships, weapons, tools, farm implements, \\nmachinery, chariots and carts, furniture, and garments. \\nThe earliest processes included binding with twine \\nand rope, riveting and nailing, and soldering. Around \\n2000 years ago, forge welding and adhesive bond- \\ning had been developed. Widespread use of screws, \\nbolts, and nuts as fasteners—so common in today’s \\nassembly—required the development of machine tools \\nthat could accurately cut the required helical shapes \\n(e.g., Maudsley’s screw cutting lathe, 1800). It was not \\nuntil around 1900 that fusion welding proc- esses \\nstarted to be developed as assembly techniques \\n(Historical Note 28.1). \\nNatural rubber was the first polymer to be used in \\nmanufacturing (if we exclude wood, which is a polymer \\ncomposite). The vulcanization process, discovered by \\nCharles Goodyear in 1839, made rubber a useful engi- \\nneering material (Historical Note 8.2). Subsequent de- \\nvelopments included plastics such as cellulose nitrate \\nin 1870, Bakelite in 1900, polyvinylchloride in 1927, pol- \\nyethylene in 1932, and nylon in the late 1930s (Histori- \\ncal Note 8.1). Processing requirements for plastics led \\nto the development of injection molding (based on die \\ncasting, one of the metal casting processes) and other \\npolymer shaping techniques. \\nElectronics products have imposed unusual de- \\nmands on manufacturing in terms of miniaturization. \\nThe evolution of the technology has been to package \\nmore and more devices into a smaller area—in some \\ncases millions of transistors onto a flat piece of semi- \\nconductor material that is only 12 mm (0.50 in) on a \\nside. The history of electronics processing and pack- \\naging dates from around 1960 (Historical Notes 33.1, \\n34.1, and 34.2). \\n \\n \\n \\n1.3.1 PROCESSING OPERATIONS \\n \\nA processing operation uses energy to alter a work part’s shape, physical properties, \\nor appearance to add value to the material. The forms of energy include mechani- \\ncal, thermal, electrical, and chemical. The energy is applied in a controlled way by \\nmeans of machinery and tooling. Human energy may also be required, but the hu- \\nman workers are generally employed to control the machines, oversee the opera- \\ntions, and load and unload parts before and after each cycle of operation. A general \\nmodel of a processing operation is illustrated in Figure 1.1(a). Material is fed into the \\nprocess, energy is applied by the machinery and tooling to transform the material, \\nand the completed work part exits the process. Most production operations produce \\nwaste or scrap, either as a natural aspect of the process (e.g., removing material as in \\nmachining) or in the form of occasional defective pieces. It is an important objective \\nin manufacturing to reduce waste in either of these forms. \\nMore than one processing operation is usually required to transform the starting \\nmaterial into final form. The operations are performed in the particular sequence \\nrequired to achieve the geometry and condition defined by the design specification. \\nSection 1.3/Manufacturing Processes \\n14 \\n \\n \\nThree categories of processing operations are distinguished: (1) shaping opera- \\ntions, (2) property-enhancing operations, and (3) surface processing operations. \\nShaping operations alter the geometry of the starting work material by vari- \\nous methods. Common shaping processes include casting, forging, and machining. \\nProperty-enhancing operations add value to the material by improving its physical \\nproperties without changing its shape. Heat treatment is the most common example. \\nSurface processing operations are performed to clean, treat, coat, or deposit mate- \\nrial onto the exterior surface of the work. Common examples of coating are plating \\nand painting. Shaping processes are covered in Parts III through VI, corresponding \\nto the four main categories of shaping processes in Figure 1.5. Property-enhancing \\nprocesses and surface processing operations are covered in Part VII. \\n \\nShaping Processes Most shape processing operations apply heat, mechanical \\nforce or a combination of these to effect a change in geometry of the work material. \\nThere are various ways to classify the shaping processes. The classification used in this \\nbook is based on the state of the starting material, by which there are four categories: \\n(1) solidification processes, in which the starting material is a heated liquid or semif- luid \\nthat cools and solidifies to form the part geometry; (2) particulate processing, in which \\nthe starting material is a powder, and the powders are formed and heated into the \\ndesired geometry; (3) deformation processes, in which the starting material is a \\nductile solid (commonly metal) that is deformed to shape the part; and (4) material \\nremoval processes, in which the starting material is a solid (ductile or brittle), from \\nwhich material is removed so that the resulting part has the desired geometry. \\nIn the first category, the starting material is heated sufficiently to transform it into \\na liquid or highly plastic (semifluid) state. Nearly all materials can be processed in \\nthis way. Metals, ceramic glasses, and plastics can all be heated to sufficiently high \\ntemperatures to convert them into liquids. With the material in a liquid or semifluid \\nform, it can be poured or otherwise forced to flow into a mold cavity and allowed to \\nsolidify, thus taking a solid shape that is the same as the cavity. Most processes that \\noperate this way are called casting or molding. Casting is the name used for metals, \\nand molding is the common term used for plastics. This category of shaping process \\nis depicted in Figure 1.6. Figure 11.1 shows a cast iron casting, and a collection of \\nplastic molded parts is displayed in Figure 13.20. \\nIn particulate processing, the starting materials are powders of metals or \\nceramics. Although these two materials are quite different, the processes to shape \\nthem in particulate processing are quite similar. The common technique in powder \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 1.6 Casting \\nand molding processes \\nstart with a work mate- \\nrial heated to a fluid \\nor semifluid state. The \\nprocess consists of \\n(1) pouring the fluid \\ninto a mold cavity and \\n(2) allowing the fluid to \\nsolidify, after which the \\nsolid part is removed \\nfrom the mold. \\nSection 1.3/Manufacturing Processes \\n15 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 1.7 \\nParticulate processing: \\n(1) the starting material \\nis powder; the usual \\nprocess consists of \\n(2) pressing and \\n(3) sintering. \\n \\n \\nmetallurgy involves pressing and sintering, illustrated in Figure 1.7, in which the \\npowders are first squeezed into a die cavity under high pressure and then heated to \\nbond the individual particles together. Examples of parts produced by powder \\nmetallurgy are shown in Figure 15.1. \\nIn the deformation processes, the starting work part is shaped by the application \\nof forces that exceed the yield strength of the material. For the material to be formed \\nin this way, it must be sufficiently ductile to avoid fracture during deformation. To \\nincrease ductility (and for other reasons), the work material is often heated before \\nforming to a temperature below the melting point. Deformation processes are asso- \\nciated most closely with metalworking and include operations such as forging and \\nextrusion, shown in Figure 1.8. Figure 18.19 shows a forging operation performed by \\na drop hammer. \\nAlso included within the deformation processes category is sheet metalworking, \\nwhich involves bending, forming, and shearing operations performed on starting \\nblanks and strips of sheet metal. Several sheet metal parts, called stampings because \\nthey are made on a stamping press, are illustrated in Figure 19.35. \\nMaterial removal processes are operations that remove excess material from the \\nstarting workpiece so that the resulting shape is the desired geometry. The most \\nimportant processes in this category are machining operations such as turning, \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 1.8 Some \\ncommon deformation \\nprocesses: (a) forging, \\nin which two halves \\nof a die squeeze the \\nwork part, causing it to \\nassume the shape of \\nthe die cavity; and \\n(b) extrusion, in which \\na billet is forced to flow \\nthrough a die orifice, \\nthus taking the cross- \\nsectional shape of the \\norifice. \\nSection 1.3/Manufacturing Processes \\n16 \\n \\n \\n \\nWorkpiece \\n \\n \\nRotation \\n(work) \\nStarting \\ndiameter Chip \\nDiameter \\nafter turning \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nDrill bit \\nWork part \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nWork \\n \\n \\n \\nMilling \\n \\n \\n \\nRotation \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMaterial \\nremoved \\n \\nFeed tool \\nSingle point \\ncutting tool \\nHole \\n \\nFeed \\n(a) \\n(b) \\n(c) \\n \\nFIGURE 1.9  Common machining operations: (a) turning, in which a single-point cutting tool removes metal from \\na rotating workpiece to reduce its diameter; (b) drilling, in which a rotating drill bit is fed into the work to create a \\nround hole; and (c) milling, in which a work part is fed past a rotating cutter with multiple edges. \\n \\n \\ndrilling, and milling, shown in Figure 1.9. These cutting operations are most com- \\nmonly applied to solid metals, performed using cutting tools that are harder and \\nstronger than the work metal. \\nThe front cover of this book shows a turning operation. \\nGrinding is another common material removal process. Other processes in this \\ncategory are known as nontraditional processes because they use lasers, electron \\nbeams, chemical erosion, electric discharges, and electrochemical energy to remove \\nmaterial rather than cutting or grinding tools. \\nIt is desirable to minimize waste and scrap in converting a starting work part into \\nits subsequent geometry. Certain shaping processes are more efficient than others in terms \\nof material conservation. Material removal processes (e.g., machining) tend to be \\nwasteful of material, simply by the way they work. The material removed from the starting \\nshape is waste, at least in terms of the unit operation. Other processes, such as certain \\ncasting and molding operations, often convert close to 100% of the start- ing material \\ninto final product. Manufacturing processes that transform nearly all of the starting \\nmaterial into product and require no subsequent machining to achieve final part \\ngeometry are called net shape processes. Other processes require mini- mum \\nmachining to produce the final shape and are called near net shape processes. \\n \\nProperty-Enhancing Processes The second major type of part processing is \\nperformed to improve mechanical or physical properties of the work material. \\nThese processes do not alter the shape of the part, except unintentionally in some \\ncases. The most important property-enhancing processes involve heat treatments, \\nwhich include various annealing and strengthening processes for metals and glasses. \\nSintering of powdered metals is also a heat treatment that strengthens a pressed \\npowder metal work part. Its counterpart in ceramics is called firing. \\n \\nSurface Processing Surface processing operations include (1) cleaning, (2) sur- \\nface treatments, and (3) coating and thin film deposition processes. Cleaning includes \\nboth chemical and mechanical processes to remove dirt, oil, and other contaminants \\nfrom the surface. Surface treatments include mechanical working such as shot peen- \\ning and sand blasting, and physical processes such as diffusion and ion implanta- tion. \\nCoating and thin film deposition processes apply a coating of material to the exterior \\nsurface of the work part. Common coating processes include electroplating, \\ncutter \\nRotation \\nFeed \\nSection 1.3/Manufacturing Processes \\n17 \\n \\n \\nanodizing of aluminum, organic coating (call it painting), and porcelain enameling. \\nThin film deposition processes include physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor \\ndeposition to form extremely thin coatings of various substances. \\nSeveral surface-processing operations have been adapted to fabricate semi- \\nconductor materials into integrated circuits for microelectronics. These processes \\ninclude chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, and oxidation. They \\nare applied to very localized areas on the surface of a thin wafer of silicon (or other \\nsemiconductor material) to create the microscopic circuit. \\n \\n \\n1.3.2 ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS \\n \\nThe second basic type of manufacturing operation is assembly, in which two or more \\nseparate parts are joined to form a new entity. Components of the new entity are \\nconnected either permanently or semipermanently. Permanent joining processes \\ninclude welding, brazing, soldering, and adhesive bonding. They form a joint be- \\ntween components that cannot be easily disconnected. Certain mechanical assem- \\nbly methods are available to fasten two (or more) parts together in a joint that can \\nbe conveniently disassembled. The use of screws, bolts, and other threaded fasten- \\ners are important traditional methods in this category. Other mechanical assembly \\ntechniques form a more permanent connection; these include rivets, press fitting, \\nand expansion fits. Special joining and fastening methods are used in the assembly \\nof electronic products. Some of the methods are identical to or are adaptations of \\nthe preceding processes, for example, soldering. Electronics assembly is concerned \\nprimarily with the assembly of components such as integrated circuit packages to \\nprinted circuit boards to produce the complex circuits used in so many of today’s \\nproducts. Joining and assembly processes are discussed in Part VIII, and the special- \\nized assembly techniques for electronics are described in Chapter 34. \\n \\n \\n1.3.3 PRODUCTION MACHINES AND TOOLING \\n \\nManufacturing operations are accomplished using machinery and tooling (and peo- \\nple). The extensive use of machinery in manufacturing began with the Industrial \\nRevolution. It was at that time that metal cutting machines started to be developed \\nand widely used. These were called machine tools—power-driven machines used \\nto operate cutting tools previously operated by hand. Modern machine tools are \\ndescribed by the same basic definition, except that the power is electrical rather than water \\nor steam, and the level of precision and automation is much greater today. Machine \\ntools are among the most versatile of all production machines. They are used to \\nmake not only parts for consumer products, but also components for other \\nproduction machines. Both in a historic and a reproductive sense, the machine tool \\nis the mother of all machinery. \\nOther production machines include presses for stamping operations, forge ham- \\nmers for forging, rolling mills for rolling sheet metal, welding machines for weld- \\ning, and insertion machines for inserting electronic components into printed circuit \\nboards. The name of the equipment usually follows from the name of the process. \\nProduction equipment can be general purpose or special purpose. General purpose \\nequipment is more flexible and adaptable to a variety of jobs. It is commercially availa- ble \\nfor any manufacturing company to invest in. Special purpose equipment is usually \\ndesigned to produce a specific part or product in very large quantities. The economics \\nSection 1.3/Manufacturing Processes \\n18 \\n \\n \\n \\nTABLE • 1.3 \\nprocesses. \\nProduction equipment and tooling used for various manufacturing \\n \\nProcess \\nEquipment \\nSpecial tooling (function) \\nCasting \\nMolding \\nRolling \\nForging \\nExtrusion \\nStamping \\nMachining \\n \\n \\nGrinding \\nWelding \\na \\n \\nMolding machine \\nRolling mill \\nForge hammer or press \\nPress \\nPress \\nMachine tool \\n \\n \\nGrinding machine \\nWelding machine \\nMold (cavity for molten metal) \\nMold (cavity for hot polymer) \\nRoll (reduce work thickness) \\nDie (squeeze work to shape) \\nExtrusion die (reduce cross-section) \\nDie (shearing, forming sheet metal) \\nCutting tool (material removal) \\nFixture (hold work part) \\nJig (hold part and guide tool) \\nGrinding wheel (material removal) \\nElectrode (fusion of work metal) \\nFixture (hold parts during welding) \\naVarious types of casting setups and equipment (Chapter 11). \\n \\nof mass production justify large investments in special purpose machinery to achieve high \\nefficiencies and short cycle times. This is not the only reason for special purpose \\nequipment, but it is the dominant one. Another reason may be because the process \\nis unique and commercial equipment is not available. Some companies with unique \\nprocessing requirements develop their own special purpose equipment. \\nProduction machinery usually requires tooling that customizes the equipment for \\nthe particular part or product. In many cases, the tooling must be designed specifically \\nfor the part or product configuration. When used with general purpose equipment, it is \\ndesigned to be exchanged. For each work part type, the tooling is fastened to the \\nmachine and the production run is made. When the run is completed, the tooling is \\nchanged for the next work part type. When used with special purpose machines, the \\ntooling is often designed as an integral part of the machine. Because the special purpose \\nmachine is likely being used for mass production, the tooling may never need changing \\nexcept for replacement of worn components or for repair of worn surfaces. \\nThe type of tooling depends on the type of manufacturing process. In Table 1.3, \\nwe list examples of special tooling used in various operations. Details are provided \\nin the chapters that discuss these processes. \\n \\nProduction Systems \\nTo operate effectively, a manufacturing firm must have systems that allow it to ef- \\nficiently accomplish its type of production. Production systems consist of people, \\nequipment, and procedures designed for the combination of materials and processes that \\nconstitute a firm’s manufacturing operations. Production systems can be divided into \\ntwo categories: (1) production facilities and (2) manufacturing support systems, as \\nshown in Figure 1.10.2 Production facilities refer to the physical equipment and the \\narrangement of equipment in the factory. Manufacturing support systems are \\n \\n2 This diagram also indicates the major topic areas covered in this book. \\n.4 \\nSection 1.4/Production Systems \\n19 \\n \\n \\n \\nProduction system \\n \\nManufacturing \\nsupport systems \\n \\n \\n \\nManufacturing \\nsystems \\n \\n \\n \\nQuality control \\nsystems \\nManufacturing \\nsupport \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFacilities \\nFIGURE 1.10 Model of \\nthe production system \\nand overview of major \\ntopics in the book. \\nEngineering \\nmaterials \\nManufacturing processes and assembly operations \\n \\nthe procedures used by the company to manage production and solve the techni- \\ncal and logistics problems encountered in ordering materials, moving work through \\nthe factory, and ensuring that products meet quality standards. Both categories in- \\nclude people. People make these systems work. In general, direct labor workers are \\nresponsible for operating the manufacturing equipment; and professional staff \\nworkers are responsible for manufacturing support. \\n \\n \\n1.4.1 PRODUCTION FACILITIES \\n \\nProduction facilities consist of the factory and the production, material handling, \\nand other equipment in the factory. The equipment comes in direct physical contact \\nwith the parts and/or assemblies as they are being made. The facilities “touch” the \\nproduct. Facilities also include the way the equipment is arranged in the factory— \\nthe plant layout. The equipment is usually organized into logical groupings. In this \\nbook they are called manufacturing systems, such as an automated production line, \\nor a machine cell consisting of an industrial robot and two machine tools. \\nA manufacturing company attempts to design its manufacturing systems and \\norganize its factories to serve the particular mission of each plant in the most effi- \\ncient way. Over the years, certain types of production facilities have come to be \\nrecognized as the most appropriate way to organize for a given combination of prod- \\nuct variety and production quantity, as discussed in Section 1.1.2. Different types of \\nfacilities are required for each of the three ranges of annual production quantities. \\n \\nLow-Quantity Production  In the low-quantity range (1–100 units/year), the term job \\nshop is often used to describe the type of production facility. A job shop makes low \\nquantities of specialized and customized products. The products are typically \\ncomplex, such as space capsules, prototype aircraft, and special machinery. The \\nequipment in a job shop is general purpose, and the labor force is highly skilled. \\nA job shop must be designed for maximum flexibility to deal with the wide prod- \\nuct variations encountered (hard product variety). If the product is large and heavy, \\nand therefore difficult to move, it typically remains in a single location during its fab- \\nrication or assembly. Workers and processing equipment are brought to the product, \\nrather than moving the product to the equipment. This type of layout is referred to \\nas a fixed-position layout, shown in Figure 1.11(a). In a pure situation, the product \\nFinished \\nproducts \\nSection 1.4/Production Systems \\n20 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n(a) \\n(b) \\n \\nWorker \\nWorkstation \\nEquipment \\nConveyor \\n \\n \\n \\nv \\n \\n \\nCell \\nCell \\n(c) \\nWorkers \\n \\n(d) \\nFIGURE 1.11  Various types of plant layout: (a) fixed-position layout, (b) process layout, (c) cellular layout, and \\n(d) product layout. \\n \\nremains in a single location during its entire production. Examples of such products \\ninclude ships, aircraft, locomotives, and heavy machinery. In actual practice, these \\nitems are usually built in large modules at single locations, and then the completed \\nmodules are brought together for final assembly using large-capacity cranes. \\nThe individual components of these large products are often made in factories in \\nwhich the equipment is arranged according to function or type. This arrangement \\nis called a process layout. The lathes are in one department, the milling machines \\nare in another department, and so on, as in Figure 1.11(b). Different parts, each \\nrequiring a different operation sequence, are routed through the departments in the \\nparticular order needed for their processing, usually in batches. The process layout \\nis noted for its flexibility; it can accommodate a great variety of operation sequences \\nfor different part configurations. Its disadvantage is that the machinery and methods to \\nproduce a part are not designed for high efficiency. \\n \\nMedium Quantity Production \\nIn the medium-quantity range (100–10,000 units \\nannually), two different types of facility are distinguished, depending on product \\nvariety. When product variety is hard, the usual approach is batch production, in \\nwhich a batch of one product is made, after which the manufacturing equipment is \\nchanged over to produce a batch of the next product, and so on. The production rate \\nof the equipment is greater than the demand rate for any single product type, and so \\nthe same equipment can be shared among multiple products. The changeover between \\nproduction runs takes time—time to change tooling and set up the machin- ery. This \\nsetup time is lost production time, and this is a disadvantage of batch manu- facturing. \\nBatch production is commonly used for make-to-stock situations, in which \\nProduct \\nEquipment \\n(mobile) \\nWorkers \\nDepartments \\nWork unit \\nProduction \\nmachines \\nSection 1.4/Production Systems \\n21 \\n \\n \\nitems are manufactured to replenish inventory that has been gradually depleted by \\ndemand. The equipment is usually arranged in a process layout, as in Figure 1.11(b). \\nAn alternative approach to medium-range production is possible if product vari- \\nety is soft. In this case, extensive changeovers between one product style and the \\nnext may not be necessary. It is often possible to configure the manufacturing sys- \\ntem so that groups of similar products can be made on the same equipment without \\nsignificant lost time because of setup. The processing or assembly of different parts \\nor products is accomplished in cells consisting of several workstations or machines. \\nThe term cellular manufacturing is often associated with this type of production. \\nEach cell is designed to produce a limited variety of part configurations; that is, the \\ncell specializes in the production of a given set of similar parts, according to the \\nprinciples of group technology (Section 39.5). The layout is called a cellular layout, \\ndepicted in Figure 1.11(c). \\nHigh Production The high-quantity range (10,000 to millions of units per year) is \\nreferred to as mass production. The situation is characterized by a high demand rate \\nfor the product, and the manufacturing system is dedicated to the production of that \\nsingle item. Two categories of mass production can be distinguished: quantity produc- tion \\nand flow line production. Quantity production involves the mass production of \\nsingle parts on single pieces of equipment. It typically involves standard machines \\n(e.g., stamping presses) equipped with special tooling (e.g., dies and material handling \\ndevices), in effect dedicating the equipment to the production of one part type. Typi- \\ncal layouts used in quantity production are the process layout and cellular layout. \\nFlow line production involves multiple pieces of equipment or workstations \\narranged in sequence, and the work units are physically moved through the sequence to \\ncomplete the product. The workstations and equipment are designed specifically for \\nthe product to maximize efficiency. The layout is called a product layout, and the \\nworkstations are arranged into one long line, as in Figure 1.11(d), or into a series of \\nconnected line segments. The work is usually moved between stations by mecha- \\nnized conveyor. At each station, a small amount of the total work is completed on \\neach unit of product. \\nThe most familiar example of flow line production is the assembly line, associ- \\nated with products such as cars and household appliances. The pure case of flow line \\nproduction occurs when there is no variation in the products made on the line. Every \\nproduct is identical, and the line is referred to as a single model production line. To \\nsuccessfully market a given product, it is often beneficial to introduce feature and \\nmodel variations so that individual customers can choose the exact merchandise that \\nappeals to them. From a production viewpoint, the feature differences represent a \\ncase of soft product variety. The term mixed-model production line applies to these \\nsituations in which there is soft variety in the products made on the line. Modern \\nautomobile assembly is an example. Cars coming off the assembly line have varia- \\ntions in options and trim representing different models and in many cases different \\nnameplates of the same basic car design. \\n \\n1.4.2 MANUFACTURING SUPPORT SYSTEMS \\n \\nTo operate its facilities efficiently, a company must organize itself to design the proc- esses \\nand equipment, plan and control the production orders, and satisfy product quality \\nrequirements. These functions are accomplished by manufacturing sup- port \\nsystems—people and procedures by which a company manages its production \\nSection 1.4/Production Systems \\n22 \\n \\n \\noperations. Most of these support systems do not directly contact the product, but \\nthey plan and control its progress through the factory. Manufacturing support func- \\ntions are often carried out in the firm by people organized into departments such as \\nthe following: \\n \\n➢ Manufacturing engineering. The manufacturing engineering department is re- \\nsponsible for planning the manufacturing processes—deciding what processes \\nshould be used to make the parts and assemble the products. This department is \\nalso involved in designing and ordering the machine tools and other equipment \\nused by the operating departments to accomplish processing and assembly. \\n➢ Production planning and control. This department is responsible for solv- ing \\nthe logistics problem in manufacturing—ordering materials and purchased \\nparts, scheduling production, and making sure that the operating departments \\nhave the necessary capacity to meet the production schedules. \\n➢ Quality control. Producing high-quality products should be a top priority of any \\nmanufacturing firm in today’s competitive environment. It means designing and \\nbuilding products that conform to specifications and satisfy or exceed customer \\nexpectations. Much of this effort is the responsibility of the QC department. \\n \\nManufacturing Economics \\nIn Section 1.1.1, manufacturing was defined as a transformation process that adds \\nvalue to a starting work material. In Section 1.1.2, we noted that manufacturing is \\na commercial activity performed by companies that sell products to customers. It is \\nappropriate to consider some of the economic aspects of manufacturing, and that is \\nthe purpose of this section. Our coverage consists of (1) production cycle time analy- \\nsis and (2) manufacturing cost models. \\n \\n \\n1.5.1 \\nPRODUCTION CYCLE TIME ANALYSIS \\n \\n“Time is money”, as the saying goes. The total time to make a product is one of the \\ncomponents that determine its total cost and the price that can be charged for it. The \\ntotal time is the sum of all of the individual cycle times of the unit operations needed \\nto manufacture the product. As defined in Section 1.3, a unit operation is a single step \\nin the sequence of steps required to make the final product. The cycle time of a unit \\noperation is defined as the time that one work unit spends being processed or assem- \\nbled. It is the time interval between when one work unit begins the operation and \\nthe next unit begins. A typical production cycle time consists of the actual processing time \\nplus the work handling time, for example, loading and unloading the part in the \\nmachine. In some processes, such as machining, time is also required to periodically \\nchange the tooling used in the operation when it wears out. In equation form, \\nTc = To 1 Th 1 Tt \\n(1.1) \\nwhere Tc = cycle time of the unit operation, min/pc; To = actual processing time in \\nthe operation, min/pc; Th = work handling time, min/pc; and Tt = tool handling time \\nif that applies in the operation, min/pc. As indicated, the tool handling time usually \\noccurs periodically, not every cycle, so the time per workpiece must be determined \\nby dividing the actual time associated with changing the tool by the number of pieces \\n.5 \\nSection 1.5/Manufacturing Economics \\n23 \\n \\n \\nbetween tool changes. It should be mentioned that many production operations do \\nnot include a tool change, so that term is omitted from Equation (1.1) in those cases. \\nBatch and job shop production are common types of manufacturing. The time \\nto produce a batch of parts in a unit operation consists of the time to set up for the \\nbatch plus the actual run time. This can be summarized as follows: \\n \\nTb = Tsu + QTc \\n(1.2) \\n \\nwhere Tb = total time to complete the batch, min/batch; Tsu = setup time, min/batch; \\nQ = batch quantity, number of pieces (pc); and Tc = cycle time as defined in Equa- \\ntion (1.1), min/pc. To obtain a realistic value of the average production time per \\npiece, the setup time is spread over the batch quantity, as follows: \\nT = Tsu + T = Tsu + QTc = Tb  \\n(1.3) \\n \\n \\np \\nQ \\nc \\nQ \\nQ \\nwhere Tp = average production time per piece, min/pc; and the other terms are de- \\nfined above. \\nIf the batch size is one part, then Equations (1.2) and (1.3) are still applicable, and \\nQ = 1. In high production (mass production), these equations can also be used, but \\nthe value of Q is so large that the setup time loses significance: As Q → oo, Tsu/Q → 0. \\nThe average production time per piece in Equation (1.3) can be used to deter- \\nmine the actual average production rate in the operation: \\nR = 60 \\np \\nTp\\n \\n \\n(1.4) \\nwhere Rp = average hourly production rate, pc/hr. This production rate includes the \\neffect of setup time. During the production run (after the machine is set up), the \\nproduction rate is the reciprocal of the cycle time: \\nR = 60 \\nc \\nTc\\n \\n \\n(1.5) \\nwhere Rc = hourly cycle rate, cycles/hr or pc/hr. These equations indicate that the \\ncycle rate will always be larger than the actual production rate unless the setup time \\nis zero (Rc > Rp). \\n \\n \\n1.5.2 MANUFACTURING COST MODELS \\n \\nIn this section, the cycle time analysis is used to estimate the costs of production, \\nwhich include not only the cost of time but also material and overhead. The cost of \\ntime consists of labor and equipment costs, which are applied to the average produc- \\ntion time per piece as cost rates (e.g., $/hr). Thus, our cost model for production cost \\nper piece can be stated as follows: \\nCpc = Cm + (CL + Ceq)Tp + Ct \\n(1.6) \\nwhere Cpc = cost per piece, $/pc; Cm = starting material cost, $/pc; CL = labor cost \\nrate, $/min; Ceq = equipment cost rate, $/min; Ct = cost of tooling that is used in the \\nunit operation, $/pc; and Tp = average production time per piece, min/pc. If appli- \\ncable, the cost of tooling Ct must be determined by dividing the actual cost of the \\ntooling by the number of pieces between tool changes. \\nSection 1.5/Manufacturing Economics \\n24 \\n \\n \\nOverhead Costs The two cost rates, CL and Ceq, include overhead costs, which \\nconsist of all of the expenses of operating the company other than material, labor, \\nand equipment. Overhead costs can be divided into two categories: (1) factory over- \\nhead and (2) corporate overhead. Factory overhead consists of the costs of running \\nthe factory excluding materials, direct labor, and equipment. This overhead category \\nincludes plant supervision, maintenance, insurance, heat and light, and so forth. A \\nworker who operates a piece of equipment may earn an hourly wage of $15/hr, but \\nwhen fringe benefits and other overhead costs are figured in, the worker may cost \\nthe company $30/hr. Corporate overhead consists of company expenses not related \\nto the factory, such as sales, marketing, accounting, legal, engineering, research and \\ndevelopment, office space, utilities, and health benefits.3 These functions are required in \\nthe company, but they are not directly related to the cost of manufacturing. On the other \\nhand, for pricing the product, they must be added in, or else the company will lose \\nmoney on every product it sells. \\nJ Black [1] offers some estimates of the typical costs associated with manufac- \\nturing a product, presented in Figure 1.12. Several observations are worth making \\nhere. First, total manufacturing costs constitute only 40% of the product’s selling \\nprice. Corporate overhead expenses (Engineering, Research and development, \\nAdministration, sales, marketing, etc.) add up to almost as much as manufacturing \\ncost. Second, parts and materials are 50% of total manufacturing cost, so that is \\nabout 20% of selling price. Third, direct labor is only about 12% of manufacturing \\ncost, so that is less than 5% of selling price. Factory overhead, which includes the \\ncategories Plant and machinery, depreciation, energy at 26% and Indirect labor at \\n12%, adds up to more than three times Direct labor cost. \\nThe issue of overhead costs can become quite complicated. A more complete \\ntreatment can be found in [7] and most introductory accounting textbooks. Our \\napproach in this book is simply to include an appropriate overhead expense in our \\nlabor and equipment cost rates. For example, the labor cost rate is \\nRH \\nC = \\n(1 + R  \\n) \\n(1.7) \\nL \\n60 \\nLOH \\nwhere CL = labor cost rate, $/min; RH = worker’s hourly wage rate, $/hr; and RLOH = \\nlabor overhead rate, %. \\nResearch and \\ndevelopment \\nManufacturing cost \\nEngineering \\nAdministration, \\nsales, marketing, \\netc. \\nProfit \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 1.12 \\nTypical break- \\ndown of costs for \\na manufactured \\nproduct [1]. \\n \\n3Health benefits, if available from the company, are fringe benefits that apply to all regular employees, \\nand so they would be included in the direct labor overhead in the factory as well as the corporate offices. \\n40% \\n15% \\n5% \\n25% \\n15% \\n \\n \\n \\nPlant and \\nmachinery, \\nDirect \\ndepreciation, \\nIndirect \\nlabor \\nenergy, etc. \\nlabor \\nParts and materials \\n12% \\n26% \\n12% \\n50% \\n \\n \\nSection 1.5/Manufacturing Economics \\n25 \\n \\n \\nEquipment Cost Rate The cost of production equipment used in the factory is a \\nfixed cost, meaning that it remains constant for any level of production output. It is \\na capital investment that is made in the hope that it will pay for itself by producing \\na revenue stream that ultimately exceeds its cost. The company puts up the money \\nto purchase the equipment as an initial cost, and then the equipment pays back over \\na certain number of years until it is replaced or disposed of. This is different from \\ndirect labor and material costs, which are variable costs, meaning they are paid for \\nas they are used. Direct labor cost is a cost per time ($/min), and Material cost is a \\ncost per piece ($/pc). \\nIn order to determine an equipment cost rate, the initial cost plus installation cost \\nof the equipment must be amortized over the number of minutes it is used during its \\nlifetime. The equipment cost rate is defined by the following: \\nCeq =  IC  (1 + ROH) \\n(1.8) \\n60NH \\nwhere Ceq = equipment cost rate, $/min; IC = initial cost of the equipment, $; N = \\nanticipated number of years of service; H = annual number of hours of operation, \\nhr/yr; and ROH = applicable overhead rate for the equipment, %. \\n \\n \\nExample 1.1 \\nEquipment \\ncost rate \\nA production machine is purchased for an initial cost plus installation of \\n$500,000. Its anticipated life = 7 years. The machine is planned for a two-shift \\noperation, eight hours per shift, and five days per week. Assume 50 weeks per \\nyear. The applicable overhead rate on this type of equipment = 35%. Deter- \\nmine the equipment cost rate. \\nSolution: The number of hours of operation per year H = 50(2)(5)(8) = \\n4000 hr/yr. Using Equation (1.8), we have \\nCeq =   500,000  (1 + 0.35) = $0.402/min == $24.11/hr \\n60(7)(4000) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nExample 1.2 \\nCycle time and \\ncost per piece \\nThe production machine in Example 1.1 is used to produce a batch of parts \\nthat each has a starting material cost = $2.35. Batch quantity = 100. The actual \\nprocessing time in the operation = 3.72 min. Time to load and unload each \\nworkpiece = 1.60 min. Tool cost = $4.40, and each tool can be used for 20 \\npieces before it is changed, which takes 2.0 min. Before production can begin, \\nthe machine must be set up, which takes 2.5 hr. Hourly wage rate of the opera- \\ntor = $16.50/hr, and the applicable labor overhead rate = 40%. Determine (a) \\nthe cycle time for the piece, (b) average production rate when setup time is \\nfigured in, and (c) cost per piece. \\nSolution: (a) For Equation (1.1), processing time To = 3.72 min, part handling \\ntime Th = 1.50 min, and tool handling time Tt = 2.00 min/20 = 0.10 min. \\nTc = 3.72 + 1.60 + 0.10 = 5.42 min/pc \\n \\nSection 1.5/Manufacturing Economics \\n26 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nEquipment reliability and scrap rate of parts are sometimes issues in produc- \\ntion. Equipment reliability is represented by the term availability (denoted by the \\nsymbol A), which is simply the proportion uptime of the equipment. For example, if \\nA = 97%, then for every 100 hours of machine operation, we would expect on aver- \\nage that the machine would be running for 97 hours and be down for maintenance \\nand repairs for 3 hours. Scrap rate refers to the proportion of parts produced that \\nare defective. Let q denote the scrap rate. In batch production, more than the speci- \\nfied batch quantity are often produced to compensate for the losses due to scrap. \\nLet Q = the required quantity of parts to be delivered and Qo = the starting quan- \\ntity. The following equation can be used to determine how many starting parts are \\nneeded on average to satisfy an order for Q finished parts: \\nQ \\nQo = 1 - \\nq \\n \\n(1.9) \\n \\nExample 1.3 \\nScrap rate \\nA customer has ordered a batch of 1,000 parts to be produced by a machine \\nshop. Historical data indicates that the scrap rate on this type of part = 4%. \\nHow many parts should the machine shop plan to make in order to account \\nfor this scrap rate? \\nSolution: Given Q = 1,000 parts and q = 4% = 0.04, then the starting quan- \\ntity is determined as follows: \\nQ =  1000  \\n= 1000 = 1041.7 rounded to 1042 starting parts \\no \\n1 \\n- \\n0.04 \\n0.96 \\n \\n \\n \\nOf course, in modern manufacturing practice, every effort is made to minimize scrap \\nrate, with the goal being zero defects. Availability and scrap rate also figure into cal- \\nculations of production rate and part cost, as demonstrated in Example 1.4. \\n \\n \\n \\n100 \\n \\n \\n \\n6.92 \\n(c) The equipment cost rate from Example 1.1 is Ceq = $0.402/min ($24.11/hr). \\nThe labor rate is calculated as follows: \\n \\n \\n60 \\n \\n \\nSection 1.6/Recent Developments in Manufacturing \\n27 \\n \\n \\nExample 1.4 \\nCycle time and \\ncost per piece \\nA high-production operation manufactures a part for the automotive indus- \\ntry. Starting material cost = $1.75, and cycle time = 2.20 min. Equipment cost \\nrate = $42.00/hr, and labor cost rate = $24.00/hr, including overhead costs in \\nboth cases. Availability of the production machine in this job = 97%, and the \\nscrap rate of parts produced = 5%. Because this is a long-running job, setup \\ntime is ignored, and there is no tooling cost to be considered. (a) Determine \\nthe production rate and finished part cost in this operation. (b) If availability \\ncould be increased to 100% and scrap rate could be reduced to 0, what would \\nbe the production rate and finished part cost? \\nSolution: (a) Production rate, including effect of availability \\nR =  60  (0.97) = 26.45 pc/hr \\np \\n2.20 \\nHowever, because of the 5% scrap rate, the production rate of acceptable \\nparts is \\nRp = 26.45(1 - \\n0.05) = 25.13 pc/hr \\nBecause of availability and scrap rate, the part cost is \\nCpc =  \\n1.75 \\n + \\n( \\n2.20 \\n) \\n= $4.47/pc \\n(24 + 42) \\n(1 - \\n0.05) \\n(0.97) \\n60(1 - \\n0.05) \\n(b) If A = 100% and q = 0,  Rp =  60  = 27.27 pc/hr. \\n2.20 \\nPart cost Cpc = 1.75 + (42 + 24)(2.20/60) = $4.17/pc. \\nThis is an 8.5% increase in production rate and a 6.7% reduction in cost. \\n \\n \\nRecent Developments in Manufacturing \\nManufacturing materials, processes, and systems have been the object of devel- \\nopment for thousands of years (Historical Notes 1.1 and 1.2). In this section, we \\nwant to focus on developments that are of more recent vintage, say within the last \\n25 to 50 years. The discussion is organized around the following topic areas: \\n(1) microelectronics, (2) computerization of manufacturing, (3) flexible manufactur- \\ning, (4) microfabrication and nanotechnology, (5) lean production and Six Sigma, \\n(6) globalization, and (7) environmentally conscious manufacturing. \\n \\nMicroelectronics Microelectronics involves electronic devices that are fabri- \\ncated on a microscopic scale. Examples include integrated circuits, which consist of \\ncomponents such as transistors, diodes, and resistors that have been fabricated and \\nelectrically connected on a small flat chip, usually made of silicon. The remarkable \\nfeature about today’s microelectronics devices is the huge number of components \\nthat can be contained onto the chip. The capability to fabricate integrated circuits \\ndates from the early 1960s and has advanced to the point where the current technol- \\nogy is called giga-scale integration, meaning that chips are being produced consist- \\ning of billions of components. Microelectronics has become so pervasive that a large \\n.6 \\nSection 1.6/Recent Developments in Manufacturing \\n28 \\n \\n \\nproportion of the common items used today are based on this technology. Two thirds \\nof the products listed in Table 1.1 are either called electronics products or their func- \\ntion and operation depend on electronics. In this book, the fabrication of integrated \\ncircuits is covered in Chapter 33 and electronics assembly in Chapter 34. \\n \\nComputerization of Manufacturing The first digital computers date from the \\nmid-1940s, but their applications in manufacturing came quite a few years later. In the \\nmid-1960s direct numerical control was developed, in which mainframe com- puters \\nwere employed to remotely control machine tools in factories. As computer technology \\ndeveloped, enabled by advances in microelectronics, the cost of comput- ers and data \\nprocessing was reduced, leading to the widespread use of personal com- puters, not \\nonly in the office but also in the factory for tasks ranging from control of individual \\nequipment on the shop floor to control of the information required to manage the entire \\nenterprise. The Internet has allowed manufacturing companies to communicate among \\ntheir own geographically distributed plants and offices, and it has also provided access \\nto customers and suppliers around the world. In this book, several aspects of \\ncomputerization of manufacturing are included in Parts X and XI on manufacturing \\nsystems (Chapters 37 and 38) and manufacturing support systems (Chapters 39 and \\n40). \\n \\nFlexible Manufacturing During most of the twentieth century, the emphasis in \\nthe manufacturing industries in the United States was on mass production to sat- \\nisfy the consumer demands of a rapidly growing population. Mass production is still \\nwidely used in the United States and throughout the world, but computerization has \\nenabled manufacturing companies to develop systems that are able to cope with \\nproduct variations. The reader encountered several instances of this manufacturing \\nflexibility in Section 1.4.1 in the discussion of production facilities. Cellular manu- \\nfacturing and mixed-model assembly lines are two examples of manually operated \\nmanufacturing systems that are capable of producing a variety of parts or products \\nwithout the time-consuming downtime for changeover. The automobile industry, in \\nparticular, is designing its final assembly lines so that ever-greater model variations \\ncan be accommodated on a single line to meet changing and unpredictable demand \\npatterns. Computerization has also allowed flexibility to be designed into automated \\nsystems, examples of which are the flexible manufacturing systems discussed in Sec- tion \\n38.6. \\nClosely related to flexible manufacturing is mass customization, which involves \\na production system that is capable of producing individualized products for each \\ncustomer. The customer specifies the model and options, and the product is made to \\nthose specifications. Mass customization is discussed in Section 38.6.3. \\n \\nMicrofabrication and Nanotechnology Another recent development in manu- \\nfacturing, closely related to microelectronics, is the introduction of materials and \\nproducts whose dimensions are sometimes so small that they cannot be seen by the \\nnaked eye. In extreme cases, the items cannot even be seen under an optical micro- \\nscope. Products that are so miniaturized require special fabrication technologies. \\nMicrofabrication refers to the processes needed to make parts and products whose \\nfeatures sizes are in the micrometer range (1 mm = 10-3 mm = 10-6m). Examples \\ninclude ink-jet printing heads, compact discs (CDs and DVDs), and microsensors used \\nin automotive applications (e.g., air-bag deployment sensors). Nanotechnol- ogy \\nrefers to materials and products whose feature sizes are in the nanometer scale \\nSection 1.6/Recent Developments in Manufacturing \\n29 \\n \\n \\n(1 nm = 10-3 mm = 10-6 mm = 10-9m), a scale that approaches the size of atoms and \\nmolecules. Ultra-thin coatings for catalytic converters, flat screen TV monitors, and \\ncancer drugs are examples of products based on nanotechnology. The technological \\nand economic importance of microscopic and nanoscopic materials and products is \\nexpected to increase in the future, and processes are needed to produce them com- \\nmercially. Chapters 35 and 36 are devoted to these technologies. \\n \\nLean Production and Six Sigma These are two programs aimed at improving \\nefficiency and quality in manufacturing. They address demands by customers for \\nproducts they buy to be both low in cost and high in quality. Lean production and Six \\nSigma are being widely adopted by companies, especially in the United States. \\nLean production is based on the Toyota Production System developed by Toyota \\nMotors in Japan. Its origins date from the 1950s and 1960s when Toyota began using \\nunconventional approaches to improve quality, reduce inventories, and increase \\nflexibility in its operations. Lean production can be defined simply as “doing more \\nwork with fewer resources.”4 It means that fewer workers and less equipment are \\nused to accomplish more production in less time, and yet achieve higher quality in \\nthe final product. The underlying objective of lean production is the elimination of \\nvarious forms of waste, such as producing defective parts, excessive inventories, and \\nworkers waiting. Lean production is described in Sections 39.4 and 39.5 in our chap- \\nter on process planning and production control. \\nSix Sigma was started in the 1980s at Motorola Corporation in the United States. \\nThe objective was to reduce variability in the company’s processes and products to \\nincrease customer satisfaction. Today, Six Sigma can be defined as “a quality-focused \\nprogram that utilizes worker teams to accomplish projects aimed at improving an \\norganization’s operational performance.”5 Six Sigma is discussed in more detail in \\nSection 40.4.2. \\n \\nGlobalization and Outsourcing The world is becoming more and more inte- \\ngrated, creating an international economy in which barriers once established by \\nnational boundaries have been reduced or eliminated. This has enabled a freer flow \\nof goods and services, capital, technology, and people among regions and countries. \\nGlobalization is the term that describes this trend, which was recognized in the late \\n1980s and is now a dominant economic reality. Of interest here is that once under- \\ndeveloped nations such as China, India, and Mexico have developed their manufac- \\nturing infrastructures and technologies to a level such that they are now important \\nproducers in the global economy. These countries have large populations, and there- \\nfore large workforces, and low labor costs. Hourly wages are significantly higher \\nin the United States than in these countries, making it difficult for domestic U.S. \\ncompanies to compete in many products that require high labor content. Examples \\ninclude garments, furniture, toys, and electronic consumer products. The result has \\nbeen a loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States and a gain of related work to \\nthese countries. \\nOutsourcing is closely related to globalization. In manufacturing, outsourc- ing \\nrefers to the use of outside contractors to perform work that was traditionally \\n \\n4 M. P. Groover, Work Systems and the Methods, Measurement, and Management of Work [8], p. 514. The \\nterm lean production was coined by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studied \\nthe production operations at Toyota and other automobile companies in the 1980s. \\n5 Ibid, p. 541. \\nSection 1.6/Recent Developments in Manufacturing \\n30 \\n \\n \\naccomplished in-house. Outsourcing can be done in several ways, including the use \\nof local suppliers. In this case the jobs remain in the United States. Alternatively, \\nU.S. companies can outsource to foreign countries, so that parts and products once \\nmade in the United States are now made outside the country. In this case U.S. jobs \\nare displaced. Two possibilities can be distinguished: (1) offshore outsourcing, which \\nrefers to production in China or other overseas locations and transporting the items \\nby cargo ship to the United States, and (2) near-shore outsourcing, which means the items \\nare made in Canada, Mexico, or Central America and shipped by rail or truck into \\nthe United States. \\nOutsourcing has resulted in the growth of contract manufacturers, companies \\nthat specialize in producing parts, subassemblies, and/or products for other com- \\npanies. Contract manufacturers have developed expertise and efficiencies in cer- \\ntain manufacturing operations, which means they can likely produce the contracted \\nitems at prices that are lower than the production costs of the customer company if \\nit were the producer. Contract manufacturers include both domestic (U.S.) and \\nforeign companies.6 Reasons why a company might prefer to use the services of a \\ncontract manufacturer include: (1) the company benefits from cost savings because \\nit does not have to pay the factory expenses associated with production, (2) the \\ncompany can focus its resources on design and marketing of products rather than \\nmanufacturing, and (3) the company may benefit from skills possessed by the con- \\ntract manufacturer but not by itself. On the other hand, there are risks associated \\nwith contract manufacturing by the customer company. In turning over its prod- \\nuct designs it loses control over its intellectual property, which might result in the \\ncontract manufacturer becoming a competitor. The distinction between a contract \\nmanufacturer and a supplier is perhaps subtle. A supplier is usually thought of as a \\ncompany that provides materials and components for a customer who is engaged in \\nproduction of a product, whereas a contract manufacturer accomplishes the whole \\nproduction of the product. It may use suppliers itself. \\nChina is of particular interest in this discussion of globalization and outsourcing \\nbecause of (1) its fast-growing economy (it now boasts the second largest gross domes- tic \\nproduct in the world), (2) the importance of manufacturing in that economy, and \\n(3) the extent to which U.S. companies have outsourced work to China. To take advan- tage \\nof the low labor rates, many U.S. companies have moved much of their production to \\nChina (and other east Asian countries). Despite the logistics problems and costs of \\nshipping the goods back into the United States, the result has been lower costs and \\nhigher profits for the outsourcing companies, as well as lower prices and a wider \\nvariety of available products for American consumers. The downside has been the loss \\nof well-paying manufacturing jobs in the United States. Another consequence of U.S. \\noutsourcing to China has been a reduction in the relative contribution of the manufac- \\nturing sector to GDP. In the 1990s, the manufacturing industries accounted for about \\n20% of GDP in the United States. Today, that contribution is only about 12%. At the \\nsame time, the manufacturing sector in China has grown (along with the rest of its \\neconomy), now accounting for about 35% of Chinese GDP. \\nRecently, there have been signs that outsourcing of production to China by \\nAmerican companies may be declining, and that manufacturing jobs are being \\nbrought back to the U.S. There are several reasons for this trend, which is called \\n \\n6 The largest contract manufacturer at the time of this writing is Hon Hai Precision Industries (a.k.a. \\nFoxconn, headquartered in Taiwan, but many of its factories are located in China). It ranked 60th in the \\nFortune Global 500 with sales of $95 billion in 2010 (Fortune, July 25, 2011). \\nSection 1.6/Recent Developments in Manufacturing \\n31 \\n \\n \\nreshoring. First, wage rates in China are increasing as the \\ngovernment attempts to evolve from an export-driven economy \\nto a consumer-oriented economy, similar to the United States. \\nHigher Chinese wage rates mean less advantage for U.S. \\ncompa- nies to offshore jobs to China. Second, logistics costs \\nand delays involved in trans- porting products from China to North \\nAmerica are significant, especially as oil prices increase. \\nAccordingly, some companies, in their analyses of costs and \\nbenefits, have decided to produce in the United States, re-\\nopening old factories or building new ones. On the other hand, \\nU.S. companies producing goods for the Chinese market still have \\ngood reasons to keep their operations going in that country, just as \\nJapanese and German automobile makers have established \\nplants in the United States. \\n \\nEnvironmentally Conscious Manufacturing \\nAn inherent \\nfeature of virtually all manufacturing processes is waste (Section \\n1.3.1). The most obvious examples are material removal \\nprocesses, in which chips are removed from a starting \\nworkpiece to create the desired part geometry. Waste in one \\nform or another is a by-product of nearly all production \\noperations. Another unavoidable aspect of manufacturing is \\nthat power is required to accomplish any given process. \\nGenerating that power requires fossil fuels (at least in the \\nUnited States and China), the burning of which results in \\npollution of the environment. At the end of the manufacturing \\nsequence, a product is created that is sold to a customer. \\nUltimately, the product wears out and is disposed of, perhaps in \\nsome landfill, with the associated environmental degrada- tion. \\nMore and more attention is being paid by society to the \\nenvironmental impact of human activities throughout the world \\nand how modern civilization is using our natural resources at an \\nunsustainable rate. Global warming is presently a major con- \\ncern. The manufacturing industries contribute to these \\nproblems. \\nEnvironmentally conscious manufacturing refers to programs \\nthat seek to deter- mine the most efficient use of materials and \\nnatural resources in production and minimize the negative \\nconsequences on the environment. Other terms for these pro- grams \\ninclude green manufacturing and sustainable manufacturing. \\nThey all boil down to two basic approaches: (1) design products \\nthat minimize their environmen- tal impact and (2) design \\nprocesses that are environmentally friendly. \\nProduct \\ndesign \\nis \\nthe \\nlogical \\nstarting \\npoint \\nin \\nenvironmentally conscious manu- facturing. The term design \\nfor environment (DFE) is used for the techniques that attempt \\nto consider environmental impact during product design prior \\nto produc- tion. Considerations in DFE include (1) selecting \\nmaterials that require minimum energy to produce, (2) \\nselecting processes that minimize waste of materials and \\nenergy, (3) designing parts that can be recycled or reused, (4) \\ndesigning products that can be readily disassembled to recover \\nthe parts, (5) designing products that minimize the use of \\nhazardous and toxic materials, and (6) giving attention to how \\nSection 1.6/Recent Developments in Manufacturing \\n32 \\n \\nthe product will be disposed of at the end of its useful life. \\nTo a great degree, decisions made during design dictate the \\nmaterials and processes that are used to make the product. These \\ndecisions limit the options available to the manufacturing \\ndepartments to achieve sustainability. However, various \\napproaches can be applied to make plant operations more \\nenvironmentally friendly. They include \\n(1) adopting good housekeeping practices—keeping the factory \\nclean, (2) preventing pollutants from escaping into the environment \\n(rivers and atmosphere), (3) minimiz- ing waste of materials in \\nunit operations, (4) recycling rather than discarding waste \\nmaterials, (5) using net shape processes, (6) using renewable \\nenergy sources when feasible, (7) maintaining production \\nequipment so that it operates at maximum effi- ciency, and (8) \\ninvesting in equipment that minimizes power requirements. \\n \\nCCH \\n1.1 What Is Manufacturing?

In Chapter 1, manu- \\nfacturing was defined as a transformation process. It is \\nthe material that is transformed; and it is the behavior \\nof the material when subjected to the particular forces, \\ntemperatures, and other physical parameters of the \\nprocess that determines the success of the operation. \\nCertain materials respond well to certain types of manu- \\nfacturing processes and poorly or not at all to others. \\nWhat are the characteristics and properties of materials \\nthat determine their capacity to be transformed by the \\ndifferent processes? \\nPart I of this book consists of four chapters that \\naddress this question. The current chapter considers the \\natomic structure of matter and the bonding bet- ween \\natoms and molecules. It also shows how atoms and \\nmolecules in engineering materials organize themselves \\ninto two structural forms: crystalline and noncrystalline. \\nIt turns out that the basic engineering materials—metals, \\nceramics, and polymers—can exist in either form, \\nalthough a preference for a particular form is usually \\nexhibited by a given material. For exam- ple, metals \\nalmost always exist as crystals in their solid state. Glass \\n(e.g., window glass), a ceramic, assumes a noncrystalline \\nform. Some polymers are mixtures of crystalline and \\namorphous structures. \\nChapters 3 and 4 discuss the mechanical and physical \\nproperties that are relevant in manufacturing. Of course, \\nthese properties are also important in product design. \\nChapter 5 is concerned with several part and product \\n2 \\n \\n2.1\\nAtomic Structure and the Elements \\n2.2\\nBonding between Atoms and Molecules \\n2.3\\nCrystalline Structures \\n2.3.1\\n \\n2.3.2\\n \\n2.3.3\\n \\n2.3.4\\n \\n2.4\\nNoncrystalline (Amorphous) Structures \\n2.5\\nEngineering Materials \\n36 \\nSection 2.1/Atomic Structure and the Elements \\n37 \\n \\n \\nattributes that are specified during product design and must be achieved in manufac- turing: \\ndimensions, tolerances, and surface finish. Chapter 5 also describes how these attributes \\nare measured. \\n \\nAtomic Structure and the Elements \\nThe basic structural unit of matter is the atom. Each atom is composed of a positively \\ncharged nucleus, surrounded by a sufficient number of negatively charged electrons so that \\nthe charges are balanced. The number of electrons identifies the atomic number and \\nthe element of the atom. There are slightly more than 100 elements (not counting a few \\nextras that have been artificially synthesized), and these elements are the chemi- cal \\nbuilding blocks of all matter. \\nJust as there are differences among the elements, there are also similarities. The \\nelements can be grouped into families and relationships established between and \\nwithin the families by means of the Periodic Table, shown in Figure 2.1. In the \\nhorizontal direction there is a certain repetition, or periodicity, in the arrange- ment \\nof elements. Metallic elements occupy the left and center portions of the chart, and \\nnonmetals are located to the right. Between them, along a diagonal, is a transition \\nzone containing elements called metalloids or semimetals. In principle, each of the \\nelements can exist as a solid, liquid, or gas, depending on temperature and pressure. \\nAt room temperature and atmospheric pressure, they each have a natural phase; \\ne.g., iron (Fe) is a solid, mercury (Hg) is a liquid, and nitrogen (N) is a gas. \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 2.1  Periodic Table of Elements. The atomic number and symbol are listed for the 103 elements. \\n2. \\nSection 2.1/Atomic Structure and the Elements \\n38 \\n \\n \\nIn the table, the elements are arranged into vertical columns and horizontal rows \\nin such a way that similarities exist among elements in the same columns. For exam- \\nple, in the extreme right column are the noble gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton, \\nxenon, and radon), all of which exhibit great chemical stability and low reaction \\nrates. The halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine) in column \\nVIIA share similar properties (hydrogen is not included among the halogens). The \\nnoble metals (copper, silver, and gold) in column IB have similar properties. Gen- \\nerally, there are correlations in properties among elements within a given column, \\nwhereas differences exist among elements in different columns. \\nMany of the similarities and differences among the elements can be explained by their \\nrespective atomic structures. The simplest model of atomic structure, called the \\nplanetary model, shows the electrons of the atom orbiting around the nucleus at \\ncertain fixed distances, called shells, as shown in Figure 2.2. The hydrogen atom \\n(atomic number 1) has one electron in the orbit closest to the nucleus. Helium \\n(atomic number 2) has two. Also shown in the figure are the atomic structures \\nfor fluorine (atomic number 9), neon (atomic number 10), and sodium (atomic \\nnumber 11). One might infer from these models that there is a maximum number \\nof electrons that can be contained in a given orbit. This turns out to be correct, and \\nthe maximum is defined by \\nMaximum number of electrons in an orbit = 2n2 \\nwhere n identifies the orbit, with n = 1 closest to the nucleus. \\nThe number of electrons in the outermost shell, relative to the maximum \\nnumber allowed, determines to a large extent the atom’s chemical affinity for \\nother atoms. These outer-shell electrons are called valence electrons. For exam- \\nple, because a hydrogen atom has only one electron in its single orbit, it readily \\ncombines with another hydrogen atom to form a hydrogen molecule H2. For the \\nsame reason, hydrogen also reacts readily with various other elements (e.g., to \\nform H2O). In the helium atom, the two electrons in its only orbit are the maxi- \\nmum allowed (2n2 = 2(1)2 = 2), and so helium is very stable. Neon is stable for \\nthe same reason: Its outermost orbit (n = 2) has eight electrons (the maximum \\nallowed), so neon is an inert gas. \\nIn contrast to neon, fluorine has one fewer electron in its outer shell (n = 2) than \\nthe maximum allowed and is readily attracted to other elements that might share an \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 2.2  Simple model of atomic structure for several elements: (a) hydrogen, (b) helium, (c) fluorine, (d) neon, \\nand (e) sodium. \\nSection 2.2/Bonding between Atoms and Molecules \\n39 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 2.3 The sodium fluoride \\nmolecule formed by the transfer of the \\n“extra” electron of the sodium atom \\nto complete the outer orbit of the \\nfluorine atom. \\n \\nelectron to make a more stable set. The sodium atom seems divinely made for the \\nsituation, with one electron in its outermost orbit. It reacts strongly with fluorine to \\nform the compound sodium fluoride, as pictured in Figure 2.3. \\nAt the low atomic numbers considered here, the prediction of the number of \\nelectrons in the outer orbit is straightforward. As the atomic number increases to \\nhigher levels, the allocation of electrons to the different orbits becomes somewhat \\nmore complicated. There are rules and guidelines, based on quantum mechanics, \\nthat can be used to predict the positions of the electrons among the various orbits \\nand explain their characteristics. A discussion of these rules is somewhat beyond the scope \\nof this coverage of manufacturing materials. \\n \\nBonding between Atoms and Molecules \\nAtoms are held together in molecules by various types of bonds that depend on the \\nvalence electrons. By comparison, molecules are attracted to each other by weaker \\nbonds, which generally result from the electron configuration in the indi- vidual \\nmolecules. Thus, we have two types of bonding: (1) primary bonds, gener- ally \\nassociated with the formation of molecules; and (2) secondary bonds, generally associated \\nwith attraction between molecules. Primary bonds are much stronger than \\nsecondary bonds. \\n \\nPrimary Bonds Primary bonds are characterized by strong atom-to-atom attrac- \\ntions that involve the exchange of valence electrons. Primary bonds include the fol- \\nlowing forms: (a) ionic, (b) covalent, and (c) metallic, as illustrated in Figure 2.4. \\nIonic and covalent bonds are called intramolecular bonds because they involve at- \\ntractive forces between atoms within the molecule. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 2.4 Three \\nforms of primary bonding: \\n(a) ionic, (b) covalent, \\nand (c) metallic. \\n2.2 \\nSection 2.2/Bonding between Atoms and Molecules \\n40 \\n \\n \\nIn the ionic bond, the atoms of one element give up their outer electron(s), which \\nare in turn attracted to the atoms of some other element to increase their electron count \\nin the outermost shell to eight. In general, eight electrons in the outer shell is the most \\nstable atomic configuration (except for the very light atoms), and nature pro- vides a \\nvery strong bond between atoms that achieves this configuration. The previous example \\nof the reaction of sodium and fluorine to form sodium fluoride (Figure 2.3) illustrates \\nthis form of atomic bond. Sodium chloride (table salt) is a more common example. \\nBecause of the transfer of electrons between the atoms, sodium and fluorine (or sodium \\nand chlorine) ions are formed, from which this bonding derives its name. Properties of \\nsolid materials with ionic bonding include low electrical conductivity and poor \\nductility. \\nThe covalent bond is one in which electrons are shared (as opposed to trans- \\nferred) between atoms in their outermost shells to achieve a stable set of eight. \\nFluorine and diamond are two examples of covalent bonds. In fluorine, one electron \\nfrom each of two atoms is shared to form F2 gas, as shown in Figure 2.5(a). In the \\ncase of diamond, which is carbon (atomic number 6), each atom has four neighbors \\nwith which it shares electrons. This produces a very rigid three-dimensional struc- \\nture, not adequately represented in Figure 2.5(b), and accounts for the extreme high \\nhardness of this material. Other forms of carbon (e.g., graphite) do not exhibit this \\nrigid atomic structure. Solids with covalent bonding generally possess high hardness \\nand low electrical conductivity. \\nThe metallic bond is, of course, the atomic bonding mechanism in pure metals \\nand metal alloys. Atoms of the metallic elements generally possess too few elec- \\ntrons in their outermost orbits to complete the outer shells for all of the atoms in, \\nsay, a given block of metal. Accordingly, instead of sharing on an atom-to-atom \\nbasis, metallic bonding involves the sharing of outer-shell electrons by all atoms \\nto form a general electron cloud that permeates the entire block. This cloud pro- \\nvides the attractive forces to hold the atoms together and form a strong, rigid \\nstructure in most cases. Because of the general sharing of electrons, and their \\nfreedom to move within the metal, metallic bonding provides for good electri- cal \\nconductivity. Other typical properties of materials characterized by metallic \\nbonding include good conduction of heat and good ductility. (Although some of \\nthese terms are yet to be defined, the reader’s general understanding of material \\nproperties is assumed.) \\n \\nSecondary Bonds Whereas primary bonds involve atom-to-atom attractive forces, \\nsecondary bonds involve attraction forces between molecules, or intermolecular forces. \\nThere is no transfer or sharing of electrons in secondary bonding, and these bonds are \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 2.5 Two examples \\nof covalent bonding: \\n(a) fluorine gas F2, and \\n(b) diamond. \\nSection 2.3/Crystalline Structures \\n41 \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 2.6  Three types of secondary bonding: (a) dipole forces, (b) London forces, and (c) hydrogen bonding. \\n \\n \\ntherefore weaker than primary bonds. There are three forms of secondary bonding: \\n(a) dipole forces, (b) London forces, and (c) hydrogen bonding, illustrated in Figure 2.6. \\nTypes (a) and (b) are often referred to as van der Waals forces, after the scientist who \\nfirst studied and quantified them. \\nDipole forces arise in a molecule comprised of two atoms that have equal and \\nopposite electrical charges. Each molecule therefore forms a dipole, as shown in \\nFigure 2.6(a) for hydrogen chloride. Although the material is electrically neu- tral \\nin its aggregate form, on a molecular scale the individual dipoles attract each \\nother, given the proper orientation of positive and negative ends of the molecules. \\nThese dipole forces provide a net intermolecular bonding within the material. \\nLondon forces involve attractive forces between nonpolar molecules; that is, the \\natoms in the molecule do not form dipoles in the sense of the preceding paragraph. \\nHowever, owing to the rapid motion of the electrons in orbit around the molecule, \\ntemporary dipoles form when more electrons happen to be on one side of the mole- \\ncule than the other, as suggested by Figure 2.6(b). These instantaneous dipoles pro- \\nvide a force of attraction between molecules in the material. \\nFinally, hydrogen bonding occurs in molecules containing hydrogen atoms that are \\ncovalently bonded to another atom (e.g., oxygen in H2O). Because the elec- trons \\nneeded to complete the shell of the hydrogen atom are aligned on one side of \\nits nucleus, the opposite side has a net positive charge that attracts the electrons of \\natoms in neighboring molecules. Hydrogen bonding is illustrated in Figure \\n2.6(c) for water, and is generally a stronger intermolecular bonding mechanism \\nthan the other two forms of secondary bonding. It is important in the formation of \\nmany polymers. \\n \\nCrystalline Structures \\nAtoms and molecules are used as building blocks for the more macroscopic struc- ture \\nof matter that is considered here and in the following section. When materials solidify \\nfrom the molten state, they tend to close ranks and pack tightly, in many cases \\narranging themselves into a very orderly structure, and in other cases, not quite so \\norderly. Two fundamentally different material structures can be distin- guished: (1) \\ncrystalline and (2) noncrystalline. Crystalline structures are examined in this section, \\nand noncrystalline in the next. \\nMany materials form into crystals on solidification from the molten or liquid state. \\nIt is characteristic of virtually all metals, as well as many ceramics and polymers. A \\ncrystalline structure is one in which the atoms are located at regular and recurring \\npositions in three dimensions. \\nThe pattern may be replicated millions of times within \\n2.3 \\nSection 2.3/Crystalline Structures \\n42 \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 2.7 Body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure: (a) unit cell with atoms \\nindicated as point locations in a three-dimensional axis system; (b) unit cell model \\nshowing closely packed atoms (sometimes called the hard-ball model); and \\n(c) repeated pattern of the BCC structure. \\n \\na given crystal. The structure can be viewed in the form of a unit cell, which is the \\nbasic geometric grouping of atoms that is repeated. To illustrate, consider the unit \\ncell for the body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure shown in Figure 2.7, one of \\nthe common structures found in metals. The simplest model of the BCC unit cell is \\nillustrated in Figure 2.7(a). Although this model clearly depicts the locations of the \\natoms within the cell, it does not indicate the close packing of the atoms that occurs \\nin the real crystal, as in Figure 2.7(b). Figure 2.7(c) shows the repeating nature of the unit \\ncell within the crystal. \\n \\n \\n2.3.1 TYPES OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURES \\n \\nIn metals, three lattice structures are common: (1) body-centered cubic (BCC), \\n(2) face-centered cubic (FCC), and (3) hexagonal close-packed (HCP), illustrated \\nin Figure 2.8. Crystal structures for the common metals are presented in Table 2.1. \\nIt should be noted that some metals undergo a change of structure at different \\ntemperatures. Iron, for example, is BCC at room temperature; it changes to FCC \\nabove 912°C (1674°F) and back to BCC at temperatures above 1400°C (2550°F). \\nWhen a metal (or other material) changes structure like this, it is referred to as \\nbeing allotropic. \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 2.8 Three types of crystal structures in metals: (a) body-centered cubic, (b) face-centered \\ncubic, and (c) hexagonal close-packed. \\nSection 2.3/Crystalline Structures \\n43 \\n \\n \\n TABLE • 2.1 Crystal structures for the common metals (at room temperature). \\n \\nBody-Centered Cubic \\nFace-Centered Cubic \\nHexagonal Close-Packed \\n(BCC) \\n \\n(FCC) \\n \\n(HCP) \\nChromium (Cr) \\nAluminum (Al) \\nMagnesium (Mg) \\nIron (Fe) \\nCopper (Cu) \\nTitanium (Ti) \\nMolybdenum (Mo) \\nGold (Au) \\nZinc (Zn) \\nTantalum (Ta) \\nLead (Pb) \\nTungsten (W) \\nSilver (Ag) \\nNickel (Ni) \\n \\n \\n2.3.2 IMPERFECTIONS IN CRYSTALS \\n \\nThus far, crystal structures have been discussed as if they were perfect—the unit cell \\nrepeated in the material over and over in all directions. A perfect crystal is sometimes \\ndesirable to satisfy aesthetic or engineering purposes. For instance, a perfect dia- mond \\n(contains no flaws) is more valuable than one containing imperfections. In the \\nproduction of integrated circuit chips, large single crystals of silicon possess desirable \\nprocessing characteristics for forming the microscopic details of the circuit pattern. \\nHowever, there are various reasons why a crystal’s lattice structure may not \\nbe perfect. The imperfections often arise naturally because of the inability of the \\nsolidifying material to continue the replication of the unit cell indefinitely without \\ninterruption. Grain boundaries in metals are an example. In other cases, the imper- \\nfections are introduced purposely during the manufacturing process, for example, \\nthe addition of an alloying ingredient in a metal to increase its strength. \\nThe various imperfections in crystalline solids are also called defects. Either term, \\nimperfection or defect, refers to deviations in the regular pattern of the crystalline \\nlattice structure. They can be catalogued as (1) point defects, (2) line defects, and \\n(3) surface defects. \\nPoint defects are imperfections in the crystal structure involving either a single \\natom or a few atoms. The defects can take various forms including, as shown in \\nFigure 2.9: (a) vacancy, the simplest defect, involving a missing atom within the \\nlattice structure; (b) ion-pair vacancy, also called a Schottky defect, which involves \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 2.9  Point defects: (a) vacancy, (b) ion-pair vacancy, (c) interstitialcy, and (d) displaced ion. \\nSection 2.3/Crystalline Structures \\n44 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 2.10 Line \\ndefects: (a) edge \\ndislocation and \\n(b) screw dislocation. \\n \\n \\n \\n(a) \\n(b) \\n \\n \\na missing pair of ions of opposite charge in a compound that has an overall charge \\nbalance; (c) interstitialcy, a lattice distortion produced by the presence of an extra \\natom in the structure; and (d) displaced ion, known as a Frenkel defect, which oc- \\ncurs when an ion becomes removed from a regular position in the lattice structure \\nand inserted into an interstitial position not normally occupied by such an ion. \\nA line defect is a connected group of point defects that forms a line in the lat- \\ntice structure. The most important line defect is the dislocation, which can take two \\nforms: (a) edge dislocation and (b) screw dislocation. An edge dislocation is the edge \\nof an extra plane of atoms that exists in the lattice, as illustrated in Figure 2.10(a). \\nA screw dislocation, Figure 2.10(b), is a spiral within the lattice structure wrapped \\naround an imperfection line, like a screw is wrapped around its axis. Both types of \\ndislocations can arise in the crystal structure during solidification (e.g., casting), or \\nthey can be initiated during a deformation process (e.g., metal forming) performed \\non the solid material. Dislocations are useful in explaining certain aspects of me- \\nchanical behavior in metals. \\nSurface defects are imperfections that extend in two directions to form a boundary. The \\nmost obvious example is the external surface of a crystalline object that defines its \\nshape. The surface is an interruption in the lattice structure. Surface boundaries can \\nalso lie inside the material. Grain boundaries are the best example of these in- ternal \\nsurface interruptions. Metallic grains are discussed in a moment, but first let \\nconsider how deformation occurs in a crystal lattice, and how the process is aided by \\nthe presence of dislocations. \\n \\n \\n2.3.3 DEFORMATION IN METALLIC CRYSTALS \\n \\nWhen a crystal is subjected to a gradually increasing mechanical stress, its initial \\nresponse is to deform elastically. This can be likened to a tilting of the lattice struc- \\nture without any changes of position among the atoms in the lattice, in the manner \\ndepicted in Figure 2.11(a) and (b). If the force is removed, the lattice structure (and \\ntherefore the crystal) returns to its original shape. If the stress reaches a high value \\nrelative to the electrostatic forces holding the atoms in their lattice positions, a per- \\nmanent shape change occurs, called plastic deformation. What has happened is that \\nthe atoms in the lattice have permanently moved from their previous locations, and \\na new equilibrium lattice has been formed, as suggested by Figure 2.11(c). \\nSection 2.3/Crystalline Structures \\n45 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 2.11 Deformation of a crystal structure: (a) original lattice; (b) elastic deformation, \\nwith no permanent change in positions of atoms; and (c) plastic deformation, in which atoms \\nin the lattice are forced to move to new “homes.” \\n \\nThe lattice deformation shown in (c) of the figure is one possible mechanism, called \\nslip, by which plastic deformation can occur in a crystalline structure. The other is \\ncalled twinning, discussed later. \\nSlip involves the relative movement of atoms on opposite sides of a plane in the \\nlattice, called the slip plane. The slip plane must be somehow aligned with the lattice \\nstructure (as indicated in the sketch), and so there are certain preferred directions \\nalong which slip is more likely to occur. The number of these slip directions de- \\npends on the lattice type. The three common metal crystal structures are somewhat \\nmore complicated, especially in three dimensions, than the square lattice depicted in Figure \\n2.11. It turns out that HCP has the fewest slip directions, BCC the most, and FCC \\nfalls in between. HCP metals show poor ductility and are generally difficult to \\ndeform at room temperature. Metals with BCC structure would figure to have the \\nhighest ductility, if the number of slip directions were the only criterion. However, \\nnature is not so simple. These metals are generally stronger than the others, which \\ncomplicates the issue, and the BCC metals usually require higher stresses to cause \\nslip. In fact, some of the BCC metals exhibit poor ductility. Low carbon steel is a \\nnotable exception; although relatively strong, it is widely used with great commer- \\ncial success in sheet-metal-forming operations, where it exhibits good ductility. The \\nFCC metals are generally the most ductile of the three crystal structures, combining \\na good number of slip directions with (usually) relatively low to moderate strength. \\nAll three of these metal structures become more ductile at elevated temperatures, \\nand this fact is often exploited in shaping them. \\nDislocations play an important role in facilitating slip in metals. When a lattice \\nstructure containing an edge dislocation is subjected to a shear stress, the material \\ndeforms much more readily than in a perfect structure. This is explained by the fact \\nthat the dislocation is put into motion within the crystal lattice in the presence of the \\nstress, as shown in the series of sketches in Figure 2.12. Why is it easier to move a dis- \\nlocation through the lattice than it is to deform the lattice itself? The answer is that \\nthe atoms at the edge dislocation require a smaller displacement within the distorted lattice \\nstructure to reach a new equilibrium position. Thus, a lower energy level is needed \\nto realign the atoms into the new positions than if the lattice were missing the \\ndislocation. A lower stress level is therefore required to effect the deformation. \\nBecause the new position manifests a similar distorted lattice, movement of atoms \\nat the dislocation continues at the lower stress level. \\nThe slip phenomenon and the influence of dislocations have been explained here \\non a very microscopic basis. On a larger scale, slip occurs many times over \\nSection 2.3/Crystalline Structures \\n46 \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 2.12  Effect of dislocations in the lattice structure under stress. In the series of diagrams, the \\nmovement of the dislocation allows deformation to occur under a lower stress than in a perfect lattice. \\n \\n \\nthroughout the metal when subjected to a deforming load, thus causing it to ex- \\nhibit the familiar macroscopic behavior of stretching, compressing, or bending. \\nDislocations represent a good-news–bad-news situation. Because of dislocations, \\nthe metal is more ductile and yields more readily to plastic deformation (forming) \\nduring manufacturing. However, from a product design viewpoint, the metal is not \\nnearly as strong as it would be in the absence of dislocations. \\nTwinning is a second way in which metal crystals plastically deform. Twinning \\ncan be defined as a mechanism of plastic deformation in which atoms on one side of \\na plane (called the twinning plane) are shifted to form a mirror image of the other \\nside of the plane. It is illustrated in Figure 2.13. The mechanism is important in HCP metals \\n(e.g., magnesium, zinc) because they do not slip readily. Besides structure, another \\nfactor in twinning is the rate of deformation. The slip mechanism requires more \\ntime than twinning, which can occur almost instantaneously. Thus, when the \\ndeformation rate is very high, metals twin that would otherwise slip. Low carbon \\nsteel is an example that illustrates this rate sensitivity; when subjected to high strain \\nrates it twins, whereas at moderate rates it deforms by slip. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 2.13 Twinning \\ninvolves the formation \\nof an atomic mirror \\nimage (i.e., a “twin”) \\non the opposite side \\nof the twinning plane: \\n(a) before and (b) after \\ntwinning. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n(a) \\n(b) \\nSection 2.4/Noncrystalline (Amorphous) Structures \\n47 \\n \\n \\n2.3.4 GRAINS AND GRAIN BOUNDARIES IN METALS \\n \\nA given block of metal may contain millions of individual crystals, called grains. \\nEach grain has its own unique lattice orientation; but collectively, the grains are ran- \\ndomly oriented within the block. Such a structure is referred to as polycrystalline. It \\nis easy to understand how such a structure is the natural state of the material. When \\nthe block is cooled from the molten state and begins to solidify, nucleation of indi- \\nvidual crystals occurs at random positions and orientations throughout the liquid. \\nAs \\nthese crystals grow they finally interfere with each other, forming at their interface a \\nsurface defect—a grain boundary. The grain boundary consists of a transition zone, \\nperhaps only a few atoms thick, in which the atoms are not aligned with either grain. \\nThe size of the grains in the metal block is determined by the number of nucleation \\nsites in the molten material and the cooling rate of the mass, among other factors. In \\na casting process, the nucleation sites are often created by the relatively cold walls \\nof the mold, which motivates a somewhat preferred grain orientation at these walls. \\nGrain size is inversely related to cooling rate: Faster cooling promotes smaller \\ngrain size, whereas slower cooling has the opposite effect. Grain size is important \\nin metals because it affects mechanical properties. Smaller grain size is generally \\npreferable from a design viewpoint because it means higher strength and hard- \\nness. It is also desirable in certain manufacturing operations (e.g., metal forming), \\nbecause it means higher ductility during deformation and a better surface on the \\nfinished product. \\nAnother factor influencing mechanical properties is the presence of grain \\nboundaries in the metal. They represent imperfections in the crystalline structure \\nthat interrupt the continued movement of dislocations. This helps to explain why \\nsmaller grain size—therefore more grains and more grain boundaries—increases the \\nstrength of the metal. By interfering with dislocation movement, grain boundaries \\nalso contribute to the characteristic property of a metal to become stronger as it is \\ndeformed. The property is called strain hardening, and it is examined more closely \\nin Chapter 3 on mechanical properties. \\n \\nNoncrystalline (Amorphous) Structures \\nMany important materials are noncrystalline—liquids and gases, for example. Water \\nand air have noncrystalline structures. A metal loses its crystalline structure when \\nit is melted. Mercury is a liquid metal at room temperature, with its melting point \\nof -38°C (-37°F). Important classes of engineering materials have a noncrystalline \\nform in their solid state; the term amorphous is often used to describe these materi- \\nals. Glass, many plastics, and rubber fall into this category. Many important plastics \\nare mixtures of crystalline and noncrystalline forms. Even metals can be amorphous rather \\nthan crystalline, given that the cooling rate during transformation from liquid to solid \\nis fast enough to inhibit the atoms from arranging themselves into their pre- ferred \\nregular patterns. This can happen, for instance, if the molten metal is poured \\nbetween cold, closely spaced, rotating rolls. \\nTwo closely related features distinguish noncrystalline from crystalline materials: \\n(1) absence of a long-range order in the molecular structure, and (2) differences in \\nmelting and thermal expansion characteristics. \\nThe difference in molecular structure can be visualized with reference to Fig- \\nure 2.14. The closely packed and repeating pattern of the crystal structure is shown \\non the left; and the less dense and random arrangement of atoms in the noncrystalline \\n2.4 \\nSection 2.4/Noncrystalline (Amorphous) Structures \\n48 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 2.14 Illustration of difference \\nin structure between: (a) crystalline \\nand (b) noncrystalline materials.

The difference is demonstrated by a metal when it melts. The \\nmore loosely packed atoms in the molten metal show an increase in volume (reduction \\nin density) compared with the material’s solid crystalline state. This effect is character- \\nistic of most materials when melted (ice is a notable exception; liquid water is denser \\nthan solid ice). It is a general characteristic of liquids and solid amorphous materials \\nthat they are absent of long-range order as on the right in our figure. \\nThe melting phenomenon will now be examined in more detail, and in doing so, \\nthe second important difference between crystalline and noncrystalline structures is \\nillustrated. As indicated above, a metal experiences an increase in volume when it \\nmelts from the solid to the liquid state. For a pure metal, this volumetric change occurs \\nrather abruptly, at a constant temperature (i.e., the melting temperature Tm), as indi- \\ncated in Figure 2.15. The change represents a discontinuity from the slopes on either \\nside in the plot. The gradual slopes characterize the metal’s thermal expansion—the \\nchange in volume as a function of temperature, which is usually different in the solid \\nand liquid states. Associated with the sudden volume increase as the metal transforms from \\nsolid to liquid at the melting point is the addition of a certain quantity of heat, called \\nthe heat of fusion, which causes the atoms to lose the dense, regular arrange- ment \\nof the crystalline structure. The process is reversible; it operates in both direc- tions. \\nIf the molten metal is cooled through its melting temperature, the same abrupt change \\nin volume occurs (except that it is a decrease), and the same quantity of heat is given \\noff by the metal. \\nAn amorphous material exhibits quite different behavior than that of a pure \\nmetal when it changes from solid to liquid, as shown in Figure 2.15. The process \\nis again reversible, but observe the behavior of the amorphous material during \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 2.15 Characteristic change in \\nvolume for a pure metal (a crystalline \\nstructure), compared to the same \\nvolumetric changes in glass \\n(a noncrystalline structure). \\nSection 2.5/Engineering Materials \\n49 \\n \\n \\ncooling from the liquid state, rather than during melting from the solid, as before. \\nGlass (silica, SiO2) is used to illustrate. At high temperatures, glass is a true liquid, \\nand the molecules are free to move about as in the usual definition of a liquid. As \\nthe glass cools, it gradually transforms into the solid state, going through a transi- \\ntion phase, called a supercooled liquid, before finally becoming rigid. It does not \\nshow the sudden volumetric change that is characteristic of crystalline materials; \\ninstead it passes through its melting temperature Tm without a change in its thermal \\nexpansion slope. In this supercooled liquid region, the material becomes increas- \\ningly viscous as the temperature continues to decrease. As it cools further, a point \\nis finally reached at which the supercooled liquid converts to a solid. This is called \\nthe glass-transition temperature Tg. At this point, there is a change in the thermal \\nexpansion slope. (It might be more precise to refer to it as the thermal contraction \\nslope; however, the slope is the same for expansion and contraction). The rate of \\nthermal expansion is lower for the solid material than for the supercooled liquid. \\nThe difference in behavior between crystalline and noncrystalline materials can \\nbe traced to the response of their respective atomic structures to changes in temper- \\nature. When a pure metal solidifies from the molten state, the atoms arrange them- \\nselves into a regular and recurring structure. This crystal structure is much more \\ncompact than the random and loosely packed liquid from which it formed. Thus, \\nthe process of solidification produces the abrupt volumetric contraction observed \\nin Figure 2.15 for the crystalline material. By contrast, amorphous materials do not \\nachieve this repeating and closely packed structure at low temperatures. The atomic \\nstructure is the same random arrangement as in the liquid state; thus, there is no \\nabrupt volumetric change as these materials transition from liquid to solid. \\n \\nEngineering Materials \\nThis section summarizes how atomic structure, bonding, and crystal structure (or \\nabsence thereof) are related to the type of engineering material: metals, ceramics, \\nand polymers. \\n \\nMetals Metals have crystalline structures in the solid state, almost without excep- \\ntion. The unit cells of these crystal structures are almost always BCC, FCC, or HCP. \\nThe atoms of the metals are held together by metallic bonding, which means that \\ntheir valence electrons can move about with relative freedom (compared with the \\nother types of atomic and molecular bonding). These structures and bonding gener- \\nally make the metals strong and hard. Many of the metals are quite ductile (capable of being \\ndeformed, which is useful in manufacturing), especially the FCC metals. Other general \\nproperties of metals related to structure and bonding include high electri- cal and \\nthermal conductivity, opaqueness (impervious to light rays), and reflectivity \\n(capacity to reflect light rays). \\n \\nCeramics Ceramic molecules are characterized by ionic or covalent bonding, or \\nboth. The metallic atoms release or share their outermost electrons to the nonme- \\ntallic atoms, and a strong attractive force exists within the molecules. The general \\nproperties that result from these bonding mechanisms include high hardness and \\nstiffness (even at elevated temperatures) and brittleness (no ductility). The bond- \\ning also means that ceramics are electrically insulating (nonconducting), refractory \\n(thermally resistant), and chemically inert. \\n2.5 \\nSection 1.6/Recent Developments in Manufacturing \\n50 \\n \\n \\nCeramics possess either a crystalline or noncrystalline \\nstructure. Most ceramics have a crystal structure, whereas glasses \\nbased on silica (SiO2) are amorphous. In certain cases, either \\nstructure can exist in the same ceramic material. For example, \\nsilica occurs in nature as crystalline quartz. When this mineral is \\nmelted and then cooled, it solidifies to form fused silica, which \\nhas a noncrystalline structure. \\n \\nPolymers A polymer molecule consists of many repeating \\nmers to form very large molecules held together by covalent \\nbonding. Elements in polymers are usu- ally carbon plus one or \\nmore other elements such as hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and \\nchlorine. Secondary bonding (van der Waals) holds the \\nmolecules \\ntogether \\nwithin \\nthe \\naggregate \\nmaterial \\n(intermolecular bonding). Polymers have either a glassy \\nstructure or mixture of glassy and crystalline. There are \\ndifferences among the three polymer types. In thermoplastic \\npolymers, the molecules consist of long chains of mers in a \\nlinear structure. These materials can be heated and cooled \\nwithout substantially altering their linear structure. In \\nthermosetting polymers, the molecules transform into a rigid, \\nthree-dimensional structure on cooling from a heated plastic \\ncondition. If thermosetting polymers are reheated, they \\ndegrade chemically rather than soften. Elastomers have large \\nmolecules with coiled struc- tures. The uncoiling and recoiling \\nof the molecules when subjected to stress cycles motivate the \\naggregate material to exhibit its characteristic elastic behavior. \\nThe molecular structure and bonding of polymers provide them \\nwith the fol- lowing typical properties: low density, high \\nelectrical resistivity (some polymers are used as insulating \\nmaterials), and low thermal conductivity. Strength and stiff- ness \\nof polymers vary widely. Some are strong and rigid (although \\nnot matching the strength and stiffness of metals or ceramics), \\nwhereas others exhibit highly elastic behavior. \\n \\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')]\n",

      "Manufactured Products Final products made by the manufacturing industries \n",
      "can be divided into two major classes: consumer goods and capital goods. Consumer goods \n",
      "are products purchased directly by consumers, such as cars, personal comput- ers, TVs, \n",

      "goods and/or provide services. Examples of capital goods include aircraft, computers, \n",
      "communication equipment, medical apparatus, trucks and buses, railroad locomotives, \n",
      "machine tools, and construction equipment. Most of these capital goods are purchased \n",
      "by the service industries. It was noted in the introduction that manu- facturing \n",
      "accounts for about 12% of gross domestic product and services about 75% of GDP in \n",
      "the United States. Yet the manufactured capital goods purchased by the service \n",
      "sector are the enablers of that sector. Without the capital goods, the service \n",
      "industries could not function. \n",
      "In addition to final products, other manufactured items include the materials, \n",
      "components, tools, and supplies used by the companies that make the final products. \n",
      "Examples of these items include sheet steel, bar stock, metal stampings, machined \n",
      "parts, plastic moldings and extrusions, cutting tools, dies, molds, and lubricants. \n",
      "Thus, the manufacturing industries consist of a complex infrastructure with vari- \n",
      "ous categories and layers of intermediate suppliers with whom the final consumer \n",
      "never deals. \n",
      "This book is generally concerned with discrete items—individual parts and \n",
      "assembled products rather than items produced by continuous processes. A metal \n",
      "stamping is a discrete item, but the sheet-metal coil from which it is made is continu- \n",

      "Production Quantity and Product Variety The quantity of products made by a \n",
      "factory has an important influence on the way its people, facilities, and procedures \n",
      "are organized. Annual production quantities can be classified into three ranges: (1) \n",
      "low production, quantities in the range 1 to 100 units per year; (2) medium produc- \n",
      "tion, from 100 to 10,000 units annually; and (3) high production, 10,000 to millions \n",
      "of units. The boundaries between the three ranges are somewhat arbitrary (author’s \n",
      "judgment). Depending on the kinds of products, these boundaries may shift by an \n",
      "order of magnitude or so. \n",
      "Production quantity refers to the number of units produced annually of a particu- \n",
      "lar product type. Some plants produce a variety of different product types, each type being \n",
      "made in low or medium quantities. Other plants specialize in high production of only \n",
      "one product type. It is instructive to identify product variety as a parameter distinct \n",
      "from production quantity. Product variety refers to different product designs or types \n",

      "There is an inverse correlation between product variety and production quantity \n",

      "Although product variety has been identified as a quantitative parameter (the \n",

      "increased value. These three building blocks—materials, processes, and systems— \n",

      "pability refers to the scope of technical and physical capabilities and limitations of \n",
      "a manufacturing company and each of its plants. Manufacturing capability has three \n",
      "dimensions: (1) technological processing capability, (2) physical size and weight of \n",
      "product, and (3) production capacity. \n",
      " \n",
      "Technological Processing Capability The technological processing capabil- ity \n",
      "of a plant (or company) is its available set of manufacturing processes. Certain plants \n",
      "perform machining operations, others roll steel billets into sheet stock, and others build \n",
      "automobiles. A machine shop cannot roll steel, and a rolling mill can- not build cars. \n",
      "The underlying feature that distinguishes these plants is the processes they can \n",
      "perform. Technological processing capability is closely related to material type. \n",
      "Certain manufacturing processes are suited to certain materials, whereas other \n",
      "processes are suited to other materials. By specializing in a certain process or group of \n",
      "processes, the plant is simultaneously specializing in certain material types. Tech- \n",
      "nological processing capability includes not only the physical processes, but also the \n",
      "expertise possessed by plant personnel in these processing technologies. Companies \n",
      "must concentrate on the design and manufacture of products that are compatible \n",
      "with their technological processing capability. \n",
      " \n",
      "Physical Product Limitations A second aspect of manufacturing capability is \n",
      "imposed by the physical product. A plant with a given set of processes is limited in \n",
      "terms of the size and weight of the products that can be accommodated. Large, \n",
      "heavy products are difficult to move. To move these products about, the plant must \n",
      "be equipped with cranes of the required load capacity. Smaller parts and products \n",
      "made in large quantities can be moved by conveyor or other means. The limitation \n",
      "on product size and weight extends to the physical capacity of the manufacturing \n",
      "equipment as well. Production machines come in different sizes. Larger machines \n",
      "must be used to process larger parts. The production and material handling equip- \n",
      "ment must be planned for products that lie within a certain size and weight range. \n",
      " \n",
      "Production Capacity A third limitation on a plant’s manufacturing capability \n",
      "is the production quantity that can be produced in a given time period (e.g., month \n",
      "or year). This quantity limitation is commonly called plant capacity, or production \n",
      "capacity, defined as the maximum rate of production that a plant can achieve under \n",
      "assumed operating conditions. The operating conditions refer to number of shifts \n",
      "per week, hours per shift, direct labor manning levels in the plant, and so on. These \n",
      "factors represent inputs to the manufacturing plant. Given these inputs, how much \n",
      "output can the factory produce? \n",
      "Plant capacity is usually measured in terms of output units, such as annual tons of steel \n",
      "produced by a steel mill, or number of cars produced by a final assembly plant. In \n",
      "these cases, the outputs are homogeneous. In cases in which the output units are not \n",
      "homogeneous, other factors may be more appropriate measures, such as avail- able \n",
      "labor hours of productive capacity in a machine shop that produces a variety of \n",
      "parts. \n",
      "Materials, processes, and systems are the basic building blocks of manufacturing \n",

      "than any other metal. Alloys of iron and carbon form steel and cast iron. \n",
      "Steel can be defined as an iron–carbon alloy containing 0.02% to 2.11% carbon. It \n",

      "construction (bridges, I-beams, and nails), transportation (trucks, rails, and rolling \n",
      "stock for railroads), and consumer products (automobiles and appliances). \n",
      "Cast iron is an alloy of iron and carbon (2% to 4%) used in casting (primarily \n",

      "Three categories of processing operations are distinguished: (1) shaping opera- \n",

      "Shaping operations alter the geometry of the starting work material by vari- \n",
      "ous methods. Common shaping processes include casting, forging, and machining. \n",
      "Property-enhancing operations add value to the material by improving its physical \n",

      "Surface processing operations are performed to clean, treat, coat, or deposit mate- \n",

      "and painting. Shaping processes are covered in Parts III through VI, corresponding \n",

      "processes and surface processing operations are covered in Part VII. \n",
      " \n",
      "Shaping Processes Most shape processing operations apply heat, mechanical \n",
      "force or a combination of these to effect a change in geometry of the work material. \n",
      "There are various ways to classify the shaping processes. The classification used in this \n",
      "book is based on the state of the starting material, by which there are four categories: \n",
      "(1) solidification processes, in which the starting material is a heated liquid or semif- luid \n",
      "that cools and solidifies to form the part geometry; (2) particulate processing, in which \n",
      "the starting material is a powder, and the powders are formed and heated into the \n",
      "desired geometry; (3) deformation processes, in which the starting material is a \n",
      "ductile solid (commonly metal) that is deformed to shape the part; and (4) material \n",
      "removal processes, in which the starting material is a solid (ductile or brittle), from \n",
      "which material is removed so that the resulting part has the desired geometry. \n",
      "In the first category, the starting material is heated sufficiently to transform it into \n",
      "a liquid or highly plastic (semifluid) state. Nearly all materials can be processed in \n",
      "this way. Metals, ceramic glasses, and plastics can all be heated to sufficiently high \n",
      "temperatures to convert them into liquids. With the material in a liquid or semifluid \n",
      "form, it can be poured or otherwise forced to flow into a mold cavity and allowed to \n",
      "solidify, thus taking a solid shape that is the same as the cavity. Most processes that \n",
      "operate this way are called casting or molding. Casting is the name used for metals, \n",
      "and molding is the common term used for plastics. This category of shaping process \n",
      "is depicted in Figure 1.6. Figure 11.1 shows a cast iron casting, and a collection of \n",

      "connected either permanently or semipermanently. Permanent joining processes \n",

      "ers are important traditional methods in this category. Other mechanical assembly \n",
      "techniques form a more permanent connection; these include rivets, press fitting, \n",
      "and expansion fits. Special joining and fastening methods are used in the assembly \n",
      "of electronic products. Some of the methods are identical to or are adaptations of \n",
      "the preceding processes, for example, soldering. Electronics assembly is concerned \n",

      "Revolution. It was at that time that metal cutting machines started to be developed \n",
      "and widely used. These were called machine tools—power-driven machines used \n",
      "to operate cutting tools previously operated by hand. Modern machine tools are \n",
      "described by the same basic definition, except that the power is electrical rather than water \n",

      "processing requirements develop their own special purpose equipment. \n",
      "Production machinery usually requires tooling that customizes the equipment for \n",
      "the particular part or product. In many cases, the tooling must be designed specifically \n",
      "for the part or product configuration. When used with general purpose equipment, it is \n",
      "designed to be exchanged. For each work part type, the tooling is fastened to the \n",

      " \n",
      "Production facilities consist of the factory and the production, material handling, \n",
      "and other equipment in the factory. The equipment comes in direct physical contact \n",
      "with the parts and/or assemblies as they are being made. The facilities “touch” the \n",
      "product. Facilities also include the way the equipment is arranged in the factory— \n",
      "the plant layout. The equipment is usually organized into logical groupings. In this \n",
      "book they are called manufacturing systems, such as an automated production line, \n",
      "or a machine cell consisting of an industrial robot and two machine tools. \n",
      "A manufacturing company attempts to design its manufacturing systems and \n",
      "organize its factories to serve the particular mission of each plant in the most effi- \n",
      "cient way. Over the years, certain types of production facilities have come to be \n",
      "recognized as the most appropriate way to organize for a given combination of prod- \n",
      "uct variety and production quantity, as discussed in Section 1.1.2. Different types of \n",
      "facilities are required for each of the three ranges of annual production quantities. \n",
      " \n",
      "Low-Quantity Production  In the low-quantity range (1–100 units/year), the term job \n",
      "shop is often used to describe the type of production facility. A job shop makes low \n",
      "quantities of specialized and customized products. The products are typically \n",
      "complex, such as space capsules, prototype aircraft, and special machinery. The \n",
      "equipment in a job shop is general purpose, and the labor force is highly skilled. \n",
      "A job shop must be designed for maximum flexibility to deal with the wide prod- \n",
      "uct variations encountered (hard product variety). If the product is large and heavy, \n",
      "and therefore difficult to move, it typically remains in a single location during its fab- \n",
      "rication or assembly. Workers and processing equipment are brought to the product, \n",
      "rather than moving the product to the equipment. This type of layout is referred to \n",
      "as a fixed-position layout, shown in Figure 1.11(a). In a pure situation, the product \n",

      "remains in a single location during its entire production. Examples of such products \n",

      "items are usually built in large modules at single locations, and then the completed \n",
      "modules are brought together for final assembly using large-capacity cranes. \n",
      "The individual components of these large products are often made in factories in \n",
      "which the equipment is arranged according to function or type. This arrangement \n",
      "is called a process layout. The lathes are in one department, the milling machines \n",
      "are in another department, and so on, as in Figure 1.11(b). Different parts, each \n",
      "requiring a different operation sequence, are routed through the departments in the \n",
      "particular order needed for their processing, usually in batches. The process layout \n",
      "is noted for its flexibility; it can accommodate a great variety of operation sequences \n",
      "for different part configurations. Its disadvantage is that the machinery and methods to \n",
      "produce a part are not designed for high efficiency. \n",
      " \n",
      "Medium Quantity Production \n",
      "In the medium-quantity range (100–10,000 units \n",
      "annually), two different types of facility are distinguished, depending on product \n",
      "variety. When product variety is hard, the usual approach is batch production, in \n",
      "which a batch of one product is made, after which the manufacturing equipment is \n",
      "changed over to produce a batch of the next product, and so on. The production rate \n",
      "of the equipment is greater than the demand rate for any single product type, and so \n",
      "the same equipment can be shared among multiple products. The changeover between \n",
      "production runs takes time—time to change tooling and set up the machin- ery. This \n",
      "setup time is lost production time, and this is a disadvantage of batch manu- facturing. \n",

      "An alternative approach to medium-range production is possible if product vari- \n",
      "ety is soft. In this case, extensive changeovers between one product style and the \n",
      "next may not be necessary. It is often possible to configure the manufacturing sys- \n",
      "tem so that groups of similar products can be made on the same equipment without \n",
      "significant lost time because of setup. The processing or assembly of different parts \n",
      "or products is accomplished in cells consisting of several workstations or machines. \n",
      "The term cellular manufacturing is often associated with this type of production. \n",
      "Each cell is designed to produce a limited variety of part configurations; that is, the \n",
      "cell specializes in the production of a given set of similar parts, according to the \n",
      "principles of group technology (Section 39.5). The layout is called a cellular layout, \n",
      "depicted in Figure 1.11(c). \n",
      "High Production The high-quantity range (10,000 to millions of units per year) is \n",
      "referred to as mass production. The situation is characterized by a high demand rate \n",
      "for the product, and the manufacturing system is dedicated to the production of that \n",
      "single item. Two categories of mass production can be distinguished: quantity produc- tion \n",
      "and flow line production. Quantity production involves the mass production of \n",
      "single parts on single pieces of equipment. It typically involves standard machines \n",
      "(e.g., stamping presses) equipped with special tooling (e.g., dies and material handling \n",
      "devices), in effect dedicating the equipment to the production of one part type. Typi- \n",
      "cal layouts used in quantity production are the process layout and cellular layout. \n",
      "Flow line production involves multiple pieces of equipment or workstations \n",
      "arranged in sequence, and the work units are physically moved through the sequence to \n",
      "complete the product. The workstations and equipment are designed specifically for \n",
      "the product to maximize efficiency. The layout is called a product layout, and the \n",
      "workstations are arranged into one long line, as in Figure 1.11(d), or into a series of \n",
      "connected line segments. The work is usually moved between stations by mecha- \n",
      "nized conveyor. At each station, a small amount of the total work is completed on \n",
      "each unit of product. \n",
      "The most familiar example of flow line production is the assembly line, associ- \n",
      "ated with products such as cars and household appliances. The pure case of flow line \n",
      "production occurs when there is no variation in the products made on the line. Every \n",
      "product is identical, and the line is referred to as a single model production line. To \n",
      "successfully market a given product, it is often beneficial to introduce feature and \n",
      "model variations so that individual customers can choose the exact merchandise that \n",
      "appeals to them. From a production viewpoint, the feature differences represent a \n",
      "case of soft product variety. The term mixed-model production line applies to these \n",
      "situations in which there is soft variety in the products made on the line. Modern \n",
      "automobile assembly is an example. Cars coming off the assembly line have varia- \n",
      "tions in options and trim representing different models and in many cases different \n",
      "nameplates of the same basic car design. \n",

      "1.4.2 MANUFACTURING SUPPORT SYSTEMS \n",
      " \n",
      "To operate its facilities efficiently, a company must organize itself to design the proc- esses \n",
      "and equipment, plan and control the production orders, and satisfy product quality \n",
      "requirements. These functions are accomplished by manufacturing sup- port \n",

      "operations. Most of these support systems do not directly contact the product, but \n",
      "they plan and control its progress through the factory. Manufacturing support func- \n",
      "tions are often carried out in the firm by people organized into departments such as \n",
      "the following: \n",
      " \n",
      "➢ Manufacturing engineering. The manufacturing engineering department is re- \n",
      "sponsible for planning the manufacturing processes—deciding what processes \n",
      "should be used to make the parts and assemble the products. This department is \n",
      "also involved in designing and ordering the machine tools and other equipment \n",
      "used by the operating departments to accomplish processing and assembly. \n",
      "➢ Production planning and control. This department is responsible for solv- ing \n",
      "the logistics problem in manufacturing—ordering materials and purchased \n",
      "parts, scheduling production, and making sure that the operating departments \n",
      "have the necessary capacity to meet the production schedules. \n",
      "➢ Quality control. Producing high-quality products should be a top priority of any \n",
      "manufacturing firm in today’s competitive environment. It means designing and \n",

      "A given block of metal may contain millions of individual crystals, called grains. \n",
      "Each grain has its own unique lattice orientation; but collectively, the grains are ran- \n",
      "domly oriented within the block. Such a structure is referred to as polycrystalline. It \n",
      "is easy to understand how such a structure is the natural state of the material. When \n",
      "the block is cooled from the molten state and begins to solidify, nucleation of indi- \n",
      "vidual crystals occurs at random positions and orientations throughout the liquid. \n",
      "As \n",
      "these crystals grow they finally interfere with each other, forming at their interface a \n",
      "surface defect—a grain boundary. The grain boundary consists of a transition zone, \n",
      "perhaps only a few atoms thick, in which the atoms are not aligned with either grain. \n",
      "The size of the grains in the metal block is determined by the number of nucleation \n",
      "sites in the molten material and the cooling rate of the mass, among other factors. In \n",
      "a casting process, the nucleation sites are often created by the relatively cold walls \n",
      "of the mold, which motivates a somewhat preferred grain orientation at these walls. \n",
      "Grain size is inversely related to cooling rate: Faster cooling promotes smaller \n",
      "grain size, whereas slower cooling has the opposite effect. Grain size is important \n",
      "in metals because it affects mechanical properties. Smaller grain size is generally \n",
      "preferable from a design viewpoint because it means higher strength and hard- \n",
      "ness. It is also desirable in certain manufacturing operations (e.g., metal forming), \n",
      "because it means higher ductility during deformation and a better surface on the \n",
      "finished product. \n",
      "Another factor influencing mechanical properties is the presence of grain \n",
      "boundaries in the metal. They represent imperfections in the crystalline structure \n",
      "that interrupt the continued movement of dislocations. This helps to explain why \n",
      "smaller grain size—therefore more grains and more grain boundaries—increases the \n",
      "strength of the metal. By interfering with dislocation movement, grain boundaries \n",
      "also contribute to the characteristic property of a metal to become stronger as it is \n",
      "deformed. The property is called strain hardening, and it is examined more closely \n",
      "in Chapter 3 on mechanical properties. \n",

      "Noncrystalline (Amorphous) Structures \n",
      "Many important materials are noncrystalline—liquids and gases, for example. Water \n",
      "and air have noncrystalline structures. A metal loses its crystalline structure when \n",
      "it is melted. Mercury is a liquid metal at room temperature, with its melting point \n",
      "of -38°C (-37°F). Important classes of engineering materials have a noncrystalline \n",
      "form in their solid state; the term amorphous is often used to describe these materi- \n",
      "als. Glass, many plastics, and rubber fall into this category. Many important plastics \n",
      "are mixtures of crystalline and noncrystalline forms. Even metals can be amorphous rather \n",
      "than crystalline, given that the cooling rate during transformation from liquid to solid \n",
      "is fast enough to inhibit the atoms from arranging themselves into their pre- ferred \n",
      "regular patterns. This can happen, for instance, if the molten metal is poured \n",
      "between cold, closely spaced, rotating rolls. \n",
      "Two closely related features distinguish noncrystalline from crystalline materials: \n",
      "(1) absence of a long-range order in the molecular structure, and (2) differences in \n",
      "melting and thermal expansion characteristics. \n",
      "The difference in molecular structure can be visualized with reference to Fig- \n",

      "in density) compared with the material’s solid crystalline state. This effect is character- \n",
      "istic of most materials when melted (ice is a notable exception; liquid water is denser \n",
      "than solid ice). It is a general characteristic of liquids and solid amorphous materials \n",
      "that they are absent of long-range order as on the right in our figure. \n",
      "The melting phenomenon will now be examined in more detail, and in doing so, \n",
      "the second important difference between crystalline and noncrystalline structures is \n",
      "illustrated. As indicated above, a metal experiences an increase in volume when it \n",
      "melts from the solid to the liquid state. For a pure metal, this volumetric change occurs \n",
      "rather abruptly, at a constant temperature (i.e., the melting temperature Tm), as indi- \n",
      "cated in Figure 2.15. The change represents a discontinuity from the slopes on either \n",
      "side in the plot. The gradual slopes characterize the metal’s thermal expansion—the \n",
      "change in volume as a function of temperature, which is usually different in the solid \n",
      "and liquid states. Associated with the sudden volume increase as the metal transforms from \n",
      "solid to liquid at the melting point is the addition of a certain quantity of heat, called \n",
      "the heat of fusion, which causes the atoms to lose the dense, regular arrange- ment \n",
      "of the crystalline structure. The process is reversible; it operates in both direc- tions. \n",
      "If the molten metal is cooled through its melting temperature, the same abrupt change \n",

      "instead it passes through its melting temperature Tm without a change in its thermal \n",

      "selves into a regular and recurring structure. This crystal structure is much more \n",
      "compact than the random and loosely packed liquid from which it formed. Thus, \n",
      "the process of solidification produces the abrupt volumetric contraction observed \n",
      "in Figure 2.15 for the crystalline material. By contrast, amorphous materials do not \n",
      "achieve this repeating and closely packed structure at low temperatures. The atomic \n",
      "structure is the same random arrangement as in the liquid state; thus, there is no \n",

In addi- \\ntion to the three basic categories, there are (4) composites—nonhomogeneous mix- \\ntures of the other three basic types rather than a unique category. The classification \\nof the four groups is pictured in Figure 1.4. This section provides a survey of these \\nmaterials. Chapters 6 through 9 cover the four material types in more detail.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=26078, end_char_idx=27305, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Another consequence of U.S. \\noutsourcing to China has been a reduction in the relative contribution of the manufac- \\nturing sector to GDP.

Also shown in the figure are the atomic structures \\nfor fluorine (atomic number 9), neon (atomic number 10), and sodium (atomic \\nnumber 11). One might infer from these models that there is a maximum number \\nof electrons that can be contained in a given orbit. This turns out to be correct, and \\nthe maximum is defined by \\nMaximum number of electrons in an orbit = 2n2 \\nwhere n identifies the orbit, with n = 1 closest to the nucleus. \\nThe number of electrons in the outermost shell, relative to the maximum \\nnumber allowed, determines to a large extent the atom’s chemical affinity for \\nother atoms.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=102668, end_char_idx=103861, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This produces a very rigid three-dimensional struc- \\nture, not adequately represented in Figure 2.5(b), and accounts for the extreme high \\nhardness of this material. Other forms of carbon (e.g., graphite) do not exhibit this \\nrigid atomic structure. Solids with covalent bonding generally possess high hardness \\nand low electrical conductivity. \\nThe metallic bond is, of course, the atomic bonding mechanism in pure metals \\nand metal alloys. Atoms of the metallic elements generally possess too few elec- \\ntrons in their outermost orbits to complete the outer shells for all of the atoms in, \\nsay, a given block of metal. Accordingly, instead of sharing on an atom-to-atom \\nbasis, metallic bonding involves the sharing of outer-shell electrons by all atoms \\nto form a general electron cloud that permeates the entire block.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=107926, end_char_idx=109031, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In the \\nproduction of integrated circuit chips, large single crystals of silicon possess desirable \\nprocessing characteristics for forming the microscopic details of the circuit pattern. \\nHowever, there are various reasons why a crystal’s lattice structure may not \\nbe perfect. The imperfections often arise naturally because of the inability of the \\nsolidifying material to continue the replication of the unit cell indefinitely without \\ninterruption. Grain boundaries in metals are an example. In other cases, the imper- \\nfections are introduced purposely during the manufacturing process, for example, \\nthe addition of an alloying ingredient in a metal to increase its strength. \\nThe various imperfections in crystalline solids are also called defects. Either term, \\nimperfection or defect, refers to deviations in the regular pattern of the crystalline \\nlattice structure. They can be catalogued as (1) point defects, (2) line defects, and \\n(3) surface defects. \\nPoint defects are imperfections in the crystal structure involving either a single \\natom or a few atoms.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=112809, end_char_idx=116472, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.8419157630527817),\n",

Each atom is composed of a positively \\ncharged nucleus, surrounded by a sufficient number of negatively charged electrons so that \\nthe charges are balanced. The number of electrons identifies the atomic number and \\nthe element of the atom. There are slightly more than 100 elements (not counting a few \\nextras that have been artificially synthesized), and these elements are the chemi- cal \\nbuilding blocks of all matter. \\nJust as there are differences among the elements, there are also similarities. The \\nelements can be grouped into families and relationships established between and \\nwithin the families by means of the Periodic Table, shown in Figure 2.1. In the \\nhorizontal direction there is a certain repetition, or periodicity, in the arrange- ment \\nof elements. Metallic elements occupy the left and center portions of the chart, and \\nnonmetals are located to the right. Between them, along a diagonal, is a transition \\nzone containing elements called metalloids or semimetals. In principle, each of the \\nelements can exist as a solid, liquid, or gas, depending on temperature and pressure. \\nAt room temperature and atmospheric pressure, they each have a natural phase; \\ne.g., iron (Fe) is a solid, mercury (Hg) is a liquid, and nitrogen (N) is a gas. \\n \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 2.1  Periodic Table of Elements. The atomic number and symbol are listed for the 103 elements. \\n2. \\nSection 2.1/Atomic Structure and the Elements \\n38 \\n \\n \\nIn the table, the elements are arranged into vertical columns and horizontal rows \\nin such a way that similarities exist among elements in the same columns. For exam- \\nple, in the extreme right column are the noble gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton, \\nxenon, and radon), all of which exhibit great chemical stability and low reaction \\nrates. The halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine) in column \\nVIIA share similar properties (hydrogen is not included among the halogens). The \\nnoble metals (copper, silver, and gold) in column IB have similar properties. Gen- \\nerally, there are correlations in properties among elements within a given column, \\nwhereas differences exist among elements in different columns. \\nMany of the similarities and differences among the elements can be explained by their \\nrespective atomic structures. The simplest model of atomic structure, called the \\nplanetary model, shows the electrons of the atom orbiting around the nucleus at \\ncertain fixed distances, called shells, as shown in Figure 2.2. The hydrogen atom \\n(atomic number 1) has one electron in the orbit closest to the nucleus. Helium \\n(atomic number 2) has two.

      "The elements listed in the Periodic Table can be divided into three categories: metals, nonmetals, and metalloids (or semimetals). Examples of each category are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Metals: Iron (Fe)\n",
      "- Nonmetals: Nitrogen (N)\n",
      "- Metalloids (or Semimetals): Silicon (Si)\n",
      "Some materials that possess a noncrystalline structure include glass (e.g., window glass) and fused silica.\n",
      "The noble metals are copper, silver, and gold.\n",
      "Primary bonding involves strong atom-to-atom attractions that include the exchange or sharing of valence electrons, forming bonds such as ionic, covalent, and metallic. These bonds are generally associated with the formation of molecules and are much stronger than secondary bonds. In contrast, secondary bonding involves attraction forces between molecules (intermolecular forces) without the transfer or sharing of electrons, making these bonds weaker. Examples of secondary bonding include dipole forces, London forces, and hydrogen bonding.\n",
      "Ionic bonding works by the transfer of electrons from atoms of one element to atoms of another element. Specifically, the atoms of one element give up their outer electron(s), which are then attracted to the atoms of another element to increase their electron count in the outermost shell to eight, achieving a stable atomic configuration. This transfer of electrons results in the formation of ions, which are atoms with a net electric charge due to the loss or gain of electrons. The electrostatic attraction between the positively charged ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions) forms a strong bond, known as an ionic bond. An example of ionic bonding is the formation of sodium fluoride (NaF) from sodium (Na) and fluorine (F), where sodium donates an electron to fluorine, resulting in the formation of Na+ and F- ions. Properties of materials with ionic bonding include low electrical conductivity and poor ductility.\n",
      "Crystalline structures in materials are characterized by a highly ordered arrangement of atoms or molecules in a repeating pattern, forming a crystal lattice. This orderliness results in distinct unit cells, such as BCC (Body-Centered Cubic), FCC (Face-Centered Cubic), or HCP (Hexagonal Close-Packed) structures, which are typical in metals. Crystalline materials exhibit properties such as high strength, hardness, and, in the case of metals, ductility and high electrical and thermal conductivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noncrystalline (or amorphous) structures, on the other hand, lack this long-range order. The atoms or molecules are arranged more randomly, without a repeating pattern. This structure is common in materials like glass (a type of ceramic) and certain polymers. Noncrystalline materials tend to be less rigid and more brittle compared to their crystalline counterparts. They also exhibit different thermal and electrical properties, often being insulating and less thermally conductive.\n",
      "Some common point defects in a crystal lattice structure include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Vacancy: A missing atom within the lattice structure.\n",
      "2. Ion-pair vacancy (Schottky defect): A missing pair of ions of opposite charge in a compound that maintains an overall charge balance.\n",
      "3. Interstitialcy: A lattice distortion produced by the presence of an extra atom in the structure.\n",
      "4. Displaced ion (Frenkel defect): Occurs when an ion is removed from its regular position in the lattice structure and inserted into an interstitial position not normally occupied by such an ion.\n",
      "Elastic deformation in a crystal lattice structure involves a temporary tilting of the lattice without any permanent changes in the positions of the atoms. When the applied mechanical stress is removed, the lattice structure returns to its original shape. In contrast, plastic deformation results in a permanent shape change where the atoms in the lattice move from their previous locations to form a new equilibrium lattice. This permanent movement of atoms means that the lattice does not return to its original shape even after the stress is removed.\n",
      "Grain boundaries contribute to the strain hardening phenomenon in metals by interrupting the continued movement of dislocations. This interference with dislocation movement increases the strength of the metal as it is deformed.\n",
      "Some materials that have a crystalline structure include metals (which almost always exist as crystals in their solid state) and most ceramics. For example, silica occurs in nature as crystalline quartz.\n",
      "Manufacturing is the process of producing hardware, which ranges from nuts and bolts to digital computers and military weapons. It involves the conversion of raw materials into finished products through various processes and technologies. Manufacturing is a critical commercial activity performed by companies that sell products to customers, and it is a principal activity in secondary industries. The term is derived from the Latin words \"manus\" (hand) and \"factus\" (make), originally meaning \"made by hand,\" but today it encompasses automated and computer-controlled machinery.\n",
      "The provided context does not explicitly define the difference between thermoplastic polymers and thermosetting polymers. However, based on general knowledge, the difference can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Thermoplastic polymers can be melted and reshaped multiple times without undergoing any significant chemical change. They become soft when heated and harden upon cooling. Examples include polyethylene and polyvinylchloride.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thermosetting polymers, on the other hand, undergo a chemical change when they are first heated and molded, which makes them set into a permanent shape. Once set, they cannot be remelted or reshaped. Examples include Bakelite and epoxy resins.\n",
      "A unit operation is defined as a single step in the sequence of steps required to make the final product. The cycle time of a unit operation is the time that one work unit spends being processed or assembled, which includes the time interval between when one work unit begins the operation and the next unit begins. It typically consists of the actual processing time plus the work handling time, and in some processes, it also includes the time required to periodically change the tooling used in the operation when it wears out.\n",
      "In manufacturing processes, a processing operation uses energy to alter a work part’s shape, physical properties, or appearance to add value to the material. This involves applying mechanical, thermal, electrical, or chemical energy in a controlled way by means of machinery and tooling. On the other hand, an assembly operation involves putting together multiple components to create a final product. The context provided does not explicitly define assembly operations, but it focuses on processing operations which include shaping, property-enhancing, and surface processing operations.\n",
      "The four categories of shaping operations are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Solidification processes**: The starting material is a heated liquid or semifluid that cools and solidifies to form the part geometry.\n",
      "2. **Particulate processing**: The starting material is a powder, and the powders are formed and heated into the desired geometry.\n",
      "3. **Deformation processes**: The starting material is a ductile solid (commonly metal) that is deformed to shape the part.\n",
      "4. **Material removal processes**: The starting material is a solid (ductile or brittle), from which material is removed so that the resulting part has the desired geometry.\n",
      "Net shape processes are manufacturing methods that transform nearly all of the starting material into the final product, requiring no subsequent machining to achieve the final part geometry. In contrast, near net shape processes are those that require minimal machining to produce the final shape.\n",
      "The four types of permanent joining processes used in assembly are welding, brazing, soldering, and adhesive bonding.\n",
      "A machine tool is a type of production equipment used to make parts for consumer products and components for other production machines. It is considered the mother of all machinery in both a historic and reproductive sense.\n",
      "Special purpose production equipment is designed to produce a specific part or product in very large quantities. It is typically used for mass production, where the economics justify large investments to achieve high efficiencies and short cycle times. This equipment is often unique to the process and may not be commercially available, leading some companies to develop their own special purpose equipment. The tooling for special purpose machines is often an integral part of the machine and may not need changing except for replacement or repair.\n",
      "\n",
      "General purpose production equipment, on the other hand, is more flexible and adaptable to a variety of jobs. It is commercially available for any manufacturing company to invest in. The tooling used with general purpose equipment is designed to be exchanged for different work part types, allowing the equipment to be used for various production runs.\n",
      "Batch production is a manufacturing approach where a batch of one product is made, after which the manufacturing equipment is changed over to produce a batch of the next product, and so on. This method is often used for medium-quantity production (100–10,000 units annually) because the production rate of the equipment is greater than the demand rate for any single product type. This allows the same equipment to be shared among multiple products. However, the changeover between production runs takes time, which is a disadvantage as this setup time is lost production time. Batch production is commonly used for make-to-stock situations, where items are manufactured to replenish inventory that has been gradually depleted by demand. The equipment in batch production is usually arranged in a process layout.\n",
      "A process layout and a product layout differ primarily in how equipment and workstations are arranged and how work units move through the production facility:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Process Layout**:\n",
      "   - **Arrangement**: Equipment is arranged according to function or type. For example, lathes are in one department, milling machines in another, and so on.\n",
      "   - **Flexibility**: Noted for its flexibility, it can accommodate a variety of operation sequences for different part configurations.\n",
      "   - **Operation Sequence**: Different parts, each requiring a different operation sequence, are routed through the departments in the particular order needed for their processing, usually in batches.\n",
      "   - **Efficiency**: The machinery and methods to produce a part are not designed for high efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Product Layout**:\n",
      "   - **Arrangement**: Workstations and equipment are arranged in sequence, typically into one long line or a series of connected line segments.\n",
      "   - **Efficiency**: Designed specifically for the product to maximize efficiency.\n",
      "   - **Operation Sequence**: The work units are physically moved through the sequence to complete the product, often using mechanized conveyors.\n",
      "   - **Example**: The most familiar example is the assembly line, where each station completes a small amount of the total work on each unit of product.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, a process layout is organized by function and is flexible but less efficient, while a product layout is organized by the sequence of operations for a specific product and is highly efficient.\n",
      "Primary, secondary, and tertiary industries differ in their roles and the types of activities they perform:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Primary Industries**: These industries cultivate and exploit natural resources. Examples include agriculture, forestry, fishing, livestock, quarries, and mining.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Secondary Industries**: These industries take the outputs of the primary industries and convert them into consumer and capital goods. Manufacturing is the principal activity in this category. Examples include aerospace, food processing, apparel, glass and ceramics, automotive, heavy machinery, basic metals, paper, beverages, petroleum refining, building materials, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, plastics (shaping), computers, power utilities, construction, publishing, consumer appliances, textiles, electronics, tire and rubber, equipment, wood and furniture, and fabricated metals.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Tertiary Industries**: These industries constitute the service sector of the economy. Examples include banking, insurance, communications, legal services, education, real estate, entertainment, repair and maintenance, government, restaurants, health and medical services, retail trade, hotels, tourism, information services, transportation, and wholesale trade.\n",
      "Two departments that are typically classified as manufacturing support departments are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Quality control systems\n",
      "2. Manufacturing support systems\n",
      "Overhead costs in a manufacturing company consist of all the expenses of operating the company other than material, labor, and equipment. They can be divided into two categories:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Factory Overhead**: This includes the costs of running the factory excluding materials, direct labor, and equipment. Examples of factory overhead costs are:\n",
      "   - Plant supervision\n",
      "   - Maintenance\n",
      "   - Insurance\n",
      "   - Heat and light\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Corporate Overhead**: These are company expenses not directly related to the factory. Examples of corporate overhead costs are:\n",
      "   - Sales\n",
      "   - Marketing\n",
      "   - Accounting\n",
      "   - Legal\n",
      "   - Engineering\n",
      "   - Research and development\n",
      "   - Office space\n",
      "   - Utilities\n",
      "   - Health benefits\n",
      "\n",
      "These overhead costs are necessary for the company’s operations but are not directly tied to the manufacturing process. For pricing the product, these costs must be included to ensure the company does not lose money on each product sold.\n",
      "The two categories of overhead costs in a manufacturing company are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Factory Overhead**: This consists of the costs of running the factory excluding materials, direct labor, and equipment. It includes expenses such as plant supervision, maintenance, insurance, heat, and light.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Corporate Overhead**: This consists of company expenses not related to the factory, such as sales, marketing, accounting, legal, engineering, research and development, office space, utilities, and health benefits. These functions are required in the company but are not directly related to the cost of manufacturing.\n",
      "Fixed costs, such as the cost of production equipment, remain constant regardless of the level of production output. They are capital investments made with the expectation that they will generate a revenue stream that exceeds their cost over time. These costs are paid upfront and amortized over the equipment's lifetime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Variable costs, on the other hand, fluctuate with the level of production. They include direct labor and material costs, which are incurred as they are used. Direct labor cost is measured per time unit (e.g., $/min), and material cost is measured per piece (e.g., $/pc).\n",
      "The term \"availability\" is not explicitly defined in the provided context. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that \"availability\" refers to the available labor hours of productive capacity in a machine shop that produces a variety of parts. This implies the measure of how much productive capacity is accessible or usable within a given time period.\n",
      "Consumer goods are products purchased directly by consumers for personal use, such as cars, personal computers, TVs, tires, and tennis rackets. Capital goods, on the other hand, are purchased by companies to produce goods and/or provide services. Examples of capital goods include aircraft, computers, communication equipment, medical apparatus, trucks and buses, railroad locomotives, machine tools, and construction equipment.\n",
      "Soft product variety occurs when there are only small differences among products, such as the differences among car models made on the same production line. In an assembled product, soft variety is characterized by a high proportion of common parts among the models. Hard product variety occurs when the products differ substantially, and there are few common parts, if any. The difference between a car and a truck exemplifies hard variety.\n",
      "There is an inverse correlation between product variety and production quantity in terms of factory operations. If a factory’s product variety is high, then its production quantity is likely to be low; but if production quantity is high, then product variety will be low.\n",
      "Technological processing capability refers to the available set of manufacturing processes that a plant or company can perform. It includes not only the physical processes but also the expertise possessed by plant personnel in these processing technologies. This capability is closely related to the material types that the processes can handle, meaning that by specializing in certain processes, a plant simultaneously specializes in certain material types. Companies must focus on designing and manufacturing products that are compatible with their technological processing capability.\n",
      "The four categories of engineering materials used in manufacturing are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Metals\n",
      "2. Ceramics\n",
      "3. Polymers\n",
      "4. Composites\n",
      "Steel can be defined as an iron–carbon alloy containing 0.02% to 2.11% carbon.\n",
      "Applications of steel include construction (bridges, I-beams, and nails), transportation (trucks, rails, and rolling stock for railroads), and consumer products (automobiles and appliances).\n",
      "Density, as a material property, refers to the mass per unit volume of a material. It is an important characteristic that can influence various mechanical properties and behaviors of materials. For example, in the context of crystalline and noncrystalline materials, density can change with the state of the material (solid or liquid) and its atomic arrangement. Crystalline materials typically have a denser, more closely packed structure compared to noncrystalline materials, which have a more loosely packed and random arrangement of atoms.\n",
      "The provided context does not define or mention dielectric strength as a material property.\n",
      "The provided context does not contain information about what an electrolyte is.\n",
      "The provided context does not explicitly discuss the melting characteristics of metal alloys. It primarily focuses on the melting characteristics of pure metals and amorphous materials. Therefore, based on the given context, the difference in melting characteristics between a pure metal element and a metal alloy cannot be determined.\n",
      "The melting characteristics of a noncrystalline material such as glass differ significantly from those of a pure metal. When glass transitions from the solid to the liquid state, it does not exhibit the sudden volumetric change characteristic of crystalline materials. Instead, as glass cools from a high-temperature liquid state, it gradually transforms into a solid through a transition phase called a supercooled liquid. During this phase, the material becomes increasingly viscous as the temperature decreases. Glass passes through its melting temperature \\( T_m \\) without a change in its thermal expansion slope. Eventually, a point is reached where the supercooled liquid converts to a solid, known as the glass-transition temperature \\( T_g \\). At this point, there is a change in the thermal expansion slope, with the rate of thermal expansion being lower for the solid material than for the supercooled liquid. This behavior is due to the absence of a long-range order in the molecular structure of noncrystalline materials, which prevents the abrupt volumetric change seen in crystalline materials.\n",
      "The provided context does not explicitly define \"specific heat\" as a material property. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a definition for specific heat.\n",
      "The provided context does not explicitly define thermal conductivity as a material property. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide an answer to the query about thermal conductivity.\n",
      "The provided context does not contain a definition or explanation of thermal diffusivity.\n",
      "The important variables that affect mass diffusion are the number of nucleation sites in the molten material and the cooling rate of the mass.\n",
      "Resistivity is a material property that quantifies how strongly a material opposes the flow of electric current. It is an intrinsic property that depends on the material's composition and structure, and it is typically measured in ohm-meters (Ω·m). High resistivity indicates that the material is a poor conductor of electricity, while low resistivity indicates that the material is a good conductor.\n",
      "Metals are better conductors of electricity than ceramics and polymers because their atoms are held together by metallic bonding, which allows their valence electrons to move about with relative freedom. This free movement of electrons facilitates high electrical conductivity. In contrast, ceramics are characterized by ionic or covalent bonding, which results in strong attractive forces within the molecules and makes them electrically insulating. Polymers, held together by covalent bonding and secondary bonding (van der Waals forces), also exhibit high electrical resistivity, making them poor conductors of electricity.\n"

These bonds are generally associated with the formation of molecules and are much stronger than secondary bonds. In contrast, secondary bonding involves attraction forces between molecules (intermolecular forces) without the transfer or sharing of electrons, making these bonds weaker. Examples of secondary bonding include dipole forces, London forces, and hydrogen bonding.',\n",
       " 'Ionic bonding works by the transfer of electrons from atoms of one element to atoms of another element. Specifically, the atoms of one element give up their outer electron(s), which are then attracted to the atoms of another element to increase their electron count in the outermost shell to eight, achieving a stable atomic configuration. This transfer of electrons results in the formation of ions, which are atoms with a net electric charge due to the loss or gain of electrons. The electrostatic attraction between the positively charged ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions) forms a strong bond, known as an ionic bond. An example of ionic bonding is the formation of sodium fluoride (NaF) from sodium (Na) and fluorine (F), where sodium donates an electron to fluorine, resulting in the formation of Na+ and F- ions. Properties of materials with ionic bonding include low electrical conductivity and poor ductility.',\n",

Crystalline materials exhibit properties such as high strength, hardness, and, in the case of metals, ductility and high electrical and thermal conductivity.\\n\\nNoncrystalline (or amorphous) structures, on the other hand, lack this long-range order. The atoms or molecules are arranged more randomly, without a repeating pattern. This structure is common in materials like glass (a type of ceramic) and certain polymers.

During this phase, the material becomes increasingly viscous as the temperature decreases. Glass passes through its melting temperature \\\\( T_m \\\\) without a change in its thermal expansion slope. Eventually, a point is reached where the supercooled liquid converts to a solid, known as the glass-transition temperature \\\\( T_g \\\\). At this point, there is a change in the thermal expansion slope, with the rate of thermal expansion being lower for the solid material than for the supercooled liquid.

It is an intrinsic property that depends on the material's composition and structure, and it is typically measured in ohm-meters (Ω·m). High resistivity indicates that the material is a poor conductor of electricity, while low resistivity indicates that the material is a good conductor.\",\n",

This free movement of electrons facilitates high electrical conductivity. In contrast, ceramics are characterized by ionic or covalent bonding, which results in strong attractive forces within the molecules and makes them electrically insulating. Polymers, held together by covalent bonding and secondary bonding (van der Waals forces), also exhibit high electrical resistivity, making them poor conductors of electricity.']"

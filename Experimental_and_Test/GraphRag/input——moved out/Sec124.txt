1.6 Recent Developments in Manufacturing 
Making things has been an essential activity of human 
civilizations since before recorded history. Today, the 
term manufacturing is used for this activity. For techno- 
logical and economic reasons, manufacturing is impor- 
tant to the welfare of the United States and most other 
developed and developing nations. Technology can be 
defined as the application of science to provide society 
and its members with those things that are needed or 
desired. Technology affects our daily lives, directly and 
indirectly, in many ways. Consider the list of products in 
Table 1.1. They represent various technologies that help our 
society and its members to live better. What do all these 
products have in common? They are all manufac- tured. 
These technological wonders would not be avail- able to 
our society if they could not be manufactured. 
Manufacturing is the critical factor that makes technol- 
ogy possible. 
Economically, manufacturing is an important means 
by which a nation creates material wealth. In the Unit- 
ed States, the manufacturing industries account for 
only about 12% of gross domestic product (GDP). A 
country’s natural resources, such as agricultural lands, 
mineral deposits, and oil reserves, also create wealth. 
In the U.S., agriculture, mining, and similar industries 
account for less than 5% of GDP (agriculture alone is 
only about 1%). Construction and public utilities make 
up around 5%. The rest is service industries, which in- 
clude retail, transportation, banking, communication, 
education, and government. The service sector ac- 
counts for more than 75% of U.S. GDP. Government 
(federal, state, and local) accounts for more of GDP 
than the manufacturing sector; however, government 
services do not create wealth. In the modern global 
economy, a nation must have a strong manufacturing 
base (or it must have significant natural resources) if it 
is to provide a strong economy and a high standard of 
living for its people.

This opening chapter considers some general topics about manufacturing. What is 
manufacturing? How is it organized in industry? What are the materials, processes, 
and systems by which it is accomplished? 
 
What Is Manufacturing? 
The word manufacture is derived from two Latin words, manus (hand) and factus 
(make); the combination means made by hand. The English word manufacture is 
several centuries old, and “made by hand” accurately described the manual methods 
used when the word was first coined.1 Most modern manufacturing is accomplished 
by automated and computer-controlled machinery (Historical Note 1.1). 
 
 
 
1As a noun, the word manufacture first appeared in English around 1567 A.D. As a verb, it first appeared 
around 1683 A.D. 
. 
 
The history of manufacturing can be separated into  weapons, scrolls, pottery and glassware, and other 
two subjects: (1) the discovery and invention of mate-  products of the time, but the procedures were largely 
rials and processes to make things, and (2) the devel-  based on handicraft. 
opment of the systems of production. The materials   The systems aspects of manufacturing are examined 
and processes to make things predate the systems  here, and the materials and processes are discussed in 
by several millennia. Some of the processes—casting, Historical Note 1.2. Systems of manufacturing refer 
hammering (forging), and grinding—date back 6000 to the ways of organizing people and equipment so years 
or more. The early fabrication of implements and that production can be performed more efficiently. weapons 
was accomplished more as crafts and trades
Several historical events and discoveries stand out than 
manufacturing as it is known today. The ancient as having had a major impact on the development of Romans 
had what might be called factories to produce  modern manufacturing systems.

Certainly one significant discovery was the principle 
of division of labor—dividing the total work into tasks 
and having individual workers each become a special- 
ist at performing only one task. This principle had been 
practiced for centuries, but the economist Adam Smith 
(1723–1790) is credited with first explaining its eco- 
nomic significance in The Wealth of Nations. 
The Industrial Revolution (circa 1760–1830) had 
a major impact on production in several ways. It 
marked the change from an economy based on agri- 
culture and handicraft to one based on industry and 
manufacturing. The change began in England, where a 
series of machines were invented and steam power 
replaced water, wind, and animal power. These ad- 
vances gave British industry significant advantages 
over other nations, and England attempted to restrict 
export of the new technologies. However, the revo- 
lution eventually spread to other European countries 
and the United States. Several inventions of the Indus- 
trial Revolution greatly contributed to the development 
of manufacturing: (1) Watt’s steam engine—a new 
power-generating technology for industry; (2) machine 
tools, starting with John Wilkinson’s boring machine 
around 1775 (Historical Note 21.1); (3) the spinning 
jenny, power loom, and other machinery for the tex- 
tile industry that permitted significant increases in 
productivity; and (4) the factory system—a new way 
of organizing large numbers of production workers 
based on division of labor. 
While England was leading the industrial revolu- 
tion, an important concept was being introduced in the 
United States: interchangeable parts manufacture. 
Much credit for this concept is given to Eli Whitney 
(1765–1825), although its importance had been rec- 
ognized by others [10]. In 1797, Whitney negotiated 
a contract to produce 10,000 muskets for the U.S. 
government. The traditional way of making guns at the 
time was to custom-fabricate each part for a par- ticular 
gun and then hand-fit the parts together by fil- ing. 
Each musket was unique, and the time to make it was 
considerable. Whitney believed that the com- ponents 
could be made accurately enough to permit parts 
assembly without fitting. After several years of 
development in his Connecticut factory, he traveled to 
Washington in 1801 to demonstrate the principle. 
He laid out components for 10 muskets before gov- 
ernment officials, including Thomas Jefferson, and 
proceeded to select parts randomly to assemble the 
guns. No special filing or fitting was required, and 
all of the guns worked perfectly. The secret be- hind his 
achievement was the collection of special machines, 
fixtures, and gages that he had developed in 
his 
factory. Interchangeable parts manufacture 
required many years of development before becom- 
ing a practical reality, but it revolutionized methods of 
manufacturing. It is a prerequisite for mass produc- 
tion. Because its origins were in the United States, 
interchangeable parts production came to be known as 
the American System of manufacture. 
The mid- and late 1800s witnessed the expan- sion 
of railroads, steam-powered ships, and other machines 
that created a growing need for iron and steel. New 
steel production methods were devel- oped to meet 
this demand (Historical Note 6.1). Also during this 
period, several consumer products were developed, 
including 
the 
sewing 
machine, 
bicycle, 
and 
automobile. To meet the mass demand for these 
products, more efficient production methods were 
required. Some historians identify developments dur- 
ing this period as the Second Industrial Revolution, 
characterized in terms of its effects on manufacturing 
systems by (1) mass production, (2) scientific manage- 
ment movement, (3) assembly lines, and (4) electrifi- 
cation of factories. 
In the late 1800s, the scientific management 
movement was developing in the United States in 
response to the need to plan and control the activi- ties 
of growing numbers of production workers. The 
movement’s leaders included Frederick W. Taylor 
(1856–1915), Frank Gilbreth (1868–1924), and his wife 
Lillian (1878–1972). Scientific management included 
several features [3]: (1) motion study, aimed at find- 
ing the best method to perform a given task; (2) time 
study, to establish work standards for a job; (3) exten- 
sive use of standards in industry; (4) the piece rate 
system and similar labor incentive plans; and (5) use 
of data collection, record keeping, and cost account- 
ing in factory operations. 
Henry Ford (1863–1947) introduced the assembly 
line in 1913 at his Highland Park, Michigan plant. The 
assembly line made possible the mass production of 
complex consumer products. Use of assembly line 
methods permitted Ford to sell a Model T automobile 
for as little as $500, thus making ownership of cars 
feasible for a large segment of the U.S. population. 
In 1881, the first electric power generating station 
had been built in New York City, and soon electric mo- 
tors were being used as a power source to operate fac- 
tory machinery. This was a far more convenient power 
delivery system than steam engines, which required 
overhead belts to distribute power to the machines. By 
1920, electricity had overtaken steam as the principal 
power source in U.S. factories. The twentieth century 
was a time of more technological advances than in all 
other centuries combined. Many of these develop- 
ments resulted in the automation of manufacturing.

1.1.1 MANUFACTURING DEFINED 
 
As a field of study in the modern context, manufacturing can be defined two ways, 
one technologic, and the other economic. Technologically, manufacturing is the ap- 
plication of physical and chemical processes to alter the geometry, properties, and/ 
or appearance of a given starting material to make parts or products; manufacturing 
also includes assembly of multiple parts to make products. The processes to accom- 
plish manufacturing involve a combination of machinery, tools, power, and labor, as 
depicted in Figure 1.1(a). Manufacturing is almost always carried out as a sequence 
of operations. Each operation brings the material closer to the desired final state. 
Economically, manufacturing is the transformation of materials into items of 
greater value by means of one or more processing and/or assembly operations, as 
depicted in Figure 1.1(b). The key point is that manufacturing adds value to the 
material by changing its shape or properties, or by combining it with other materials 
that have been similarly altered. The material has been made more valuable through 
the manufacturing operations performed on it. When iron ore is converted into steel, value 
is added. When sand is transformed into glass, value is added. When petroleum is 
refined into plastic, value is added. And when plastic is molded into the complex 
geometry of a patio chair, it is made even more valuable.

a titanium billet, and the product consists of a carbon wafer assembled to the hook 
that protrudes from the right of the frame. The product is an artificial heart valve 
costing thousands of dollars, well worth it for patients who need one. (By the way, 
the surgeon who installs it charges several more thousand dollars.) The titanium 
billet costs a small fraction of the selling price. It measures about 25 mm (1 in) 
in diameter. The frame was machined (a material removal process, Section 1.3.1) 
from the starting billet. Machining time was about one hour. Note the added value 
provided by this operation. Note also the waste in the unit operation, as depicted in 
Figure 1.1(a); the finished frame has only about 5% of the mass of the starting 
workpiece (although the titanium swarf can be recycled). 
The words manufacturing and production are often used interchangeably. The 
author’s view is that production has a broader meaning than manufacturing. To illus- trate, 
one might speak of “crude oil production,” but the phrase “crude oil manufac- 
turing” seems out of place. Yet when used in the context of products such as metal 
parts or automobiles, either word seems okay. 
 
 
1.1.2 MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES AND PRODUCTS 
 
Manufacturing is an important commercial activity performed by companies that 
sell products to customers. The type of manufacturing done by a company depends 
on the kinds of products it makes. 
 
Manufacturing Industries 
Industry consists of enterprises and organizations that 
produce or supply goods and services. Industries can be classified as primary, second- ary, 
or tertiary. Primary industries cultivate and exploit natural resources, such as 
agriculture and mining. 
 
but construction and power utilities are also included. 
Tertiary industries constitute the service sector of the economy. A list of specific 
industries in these categories is presented in Table 1.2.

Secondary industries take the outputs of the primary indus- 
tries and convert them into consumer and capital goods. Manufacturing is the prin- 
Section 1.1/What Is Manufacturing?

This book is concerned with the secondary industries in Table 1.2, which include 
the companies engaged in manufacturing. However, the International Standard 
Industrial Classification (ISIC) used to compile Table 1.2 includes several industries 
whose production technologies are not covered in this text; for example, beverages, 
chemicals, and food processing. In this book, manufacturing means production of 
hardware, which ranges from nuts and bolts to digital computers and military weap- 
ons. Plastic and ceramic products are included, but apparel, paper, pharmaceuticals, 
power utilities, publishing, and wood products are excluded. 
 
Manufactured Products Final products made by the manufacturing industries 
can be divided into two major classes: consumer goods and capital goods. Consumer goods 
are products purchased directly by consumers, such as cars, personal comput- ers, TVs, 
tires, and tennis rackets. Capital goods are those purchased by companies to produce 
goods and/or provide services. Examples of capital goods include aircraft, computers, 
communication equipment, medical apparatus, trucks and buses, railroad locomotives, 
machine tools, and construction equipment. Most of these capital goods are purchased 
by the service industries. It was noted in the introduction that manu- facturing 
accounts for about 12% of gross domestic product and services about 75% of GDP in 
the United States. Yet the manufactured capital goods purchased by the service 
sector are the enablers of that sector. Without the capital goods, the service 
industries could not function. 
In addition to final products, other manufactured items include the materials, 
components, tools, and supplies used by the companies that make the final products. 
Examples of these items include sheet steel, bar stock, metal stampings, machined 
parts, plastic moldings and extrusions, cutting tools, dies, molds, and lubricants. 
Thus, the manufacturing industries consist of a complex infrastructure with vari- 
ous categories and layers of intermediate suppliers with whom the final consumer 
never deals. 
This book is generally concerned with discrete items—individual parts and 
assembled products rather than items produced by continuous processes. A metal 
stamping is a discrete item, but the sheet-metal coil from which it is made is continu- 
ous (almost). Many discrete parts start out as continuous or semicontinuous prod- 
ucts, such as extrusions and electrical wire. Long sections made in almost continuous 
lengths are cut to the desired size. An oil refinery is a better example of a continuous 
process. 
 
Production Quantity and Product Variety The quantity of products made by a 
factory has an important influence on the way its people, facilities, and procedures 
are organized. Annual production quantities can be classified into three ranges: (1) 
low production, quantities in the range 1 to 100 units per year; (2) medium produc- 
tion, from 100 to 10,000 units annually; and (3) high production, 10,000 to millions 
of units. The boundaries between the three ranges are somewhat arbitrary (author’s 
judgment). Depending on the kinds of products, these boundaries may shift by an 
order of magnitude or so. 
Production quantity refers to the number of units produced annually of a particu- 
lar product type. Some plants produce a variety of different product types, each type being 
made in low or medium quantities. Other plants specialize in high production of only 
one product type. It is instructive to identify product variety as a parameter distinct 
from production quantity. Product variety refers to different product designs or types 
that are produced in the plant. Different products have different shapes and

sizes; they perform different functions; they are intended for different markets; some have 
more components than others; and so forth. The number of different product types 
made each year can be counted. When the number of product types made in the 
factory is high, this indicates high product variety. 
There is an inverse correlation between product variety and production quantity 
in terms of factory operations. If a factory’s product variety is high, then its produc- 
tion quantity is likely to be low; but if production quantity is high, then product vari- 
ety will be low, as depicted in Figure 1.3. Manufacturing plants tend to specialize in a 
combination of production quantity and product variety that lies somewhere inside 
the diagonal band in Figure 1.3. 
Although product variety has been identified as a quantitative parameter (the 
number of different product types made by the plant or company), this parameter is 
much less exact than production quantity because details on how much the designs 
differ are not captured simply by the number of different designs. Differences 
between an automobile and an air conditioner are far greater than between an air 
conditioner and a heat pump. Within each product type, there are differences among 
specific models. 
The extent of the product differences may be small or great, as illustrated in the 
automotive industry. Each of the U.S. automotive companies produces cars with two 
or three different nameplates in the same assembly plant, although the body styles 
and other design features are virtually the same. In different plants, the company 
builds heavy trucks. The terms “soft” and “hard” might be used to describe these 
differences in product variety. Soft product variety occurs when there are only small 
differences among products, such as the differences among car models made on the 
same production line. In an assembled product, soft variety is characterized by a 
high proportion of common parts among the models. Hard product variety occurs 
when the products differ substantially, and there are few common parts, if any. The 
difference between a car and a truck exemplifies hard variety. 
 
 
1.1.3 MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY 
 
A manufacturing plant consists of a set of processes and systems (and people, of 
course) designed to transform a certain limited range of materials into products of 
increased value. These three building blocks—materials, processes, and systems— 
constitute the subject of modern manufacturing. There is a strong interdependence 
among these factors. A company engaged in manufacturing cannot do everything. 
Section 1.1/What Is Manufacturing? 
8 
 
 
It must do only certain things, and it must do those things well. Manufacturing ca- 
pability refers to the scope of technical and physical capabilities and limitations of 
a manufacturing company and each of its plants. Manufacturing capability has three 
dimensions: (1) technological processing capability, (2) physical size and weight of 
product, and (3) production capacity. 
 
Technological Processing Capability The technological processing capabil- ity 
of a plant (or company) is its available set of manufacturing processes. Certain plants 
perform machining operations, others roll steel billets into sheet stock, and others build 
automobiles. A machine shop cannot roll steel, and a rolling mill can- not build cars. 
The underlying feature that distinguishes these plants is the processes they can 
perform. Technological processing capability is closely related to material type. 
Certain manufacturing processes are suited to certain materials, whereas other 
processes are suited to other materials. By specializing in a certain process or group of 
processes, the plant is simultaneously specializing in certain material types. Tech- 
nological processing capability includes not only the physical processes, but also the 
expertise possessed by plant personnel in these processing technologies. Companies 
must concentrate on the design and manufacture of products that are compatible 
with their technological processing capability. 
 
Physical Product Limitations A second aspect of manufacturing capability is 
imposed by the physical product. A plant with a given set of processes is limited in 
terms of the size and weight of the products that can be accommodated. Large, 
heavy products are difficult to move. To move these products about, the plant must 
be equipped with cranes of the required load capacity. Smaller parts and products 
made in large quantities can be moved by conveyor or other means. The limitation 
on product size and weight extends to the physical capacity of the manufacturing 
equipment as well. Production machines come in different sizes. Larger machines 
must be used to process larger parts. The production and material handling equip- 
ment must be planned for products that lie within a certain size and weight range. 
 
Production Capacity A third limitation on a plant’s manufacturing capability 
is the production quantity that can be produced in a given time period (e.g., month 
or year). This quantity limitation is commonly called plant capacity, or production 
capacity, defined as the maximum rate of production that a plant can achieve under 
assumed operating conditions. The operating conditions refer to number of shifts 
per week, hours per shift, direct labor manning levels in the plant, and so on. These 
factors represent inputs to the manufacturing plant. Given these inputs, how much 
output can the factory produce? 
Plant capacity is usually measured in terms of output units, such as annual tons of steel 
produced by a steel mill, or number of cars produced by a final assembly plant. In 
these cases, the outputs are homogeneous. In cases in which the output units are not 
homogeneous, other factors may be more appropriate measures, such as avail- able 
labor hours of productive capacity in a machine shop that produces a variety of 
parts. 
Materials, processes, and systems are the basic building blocks of manufacturing 
and the three broad subject areas of this book. This introductory chapter provides 
an overview of these three subjects before embarking on a detailed coverage in the 
remaining chapters.

Materials in Manufacturing 
Most engineering materials can be classified into one of three basic categories: 
(1) metals, (2) ceramics, and (3) polymers. Their chemistries are different, their 
mechanical and physical properties are different, and these differences affect the 
manufacturing processes that can be used to produce products from them. In addi- 
tion to the three basic categories, there are (4) composites—nonhomogeneous mix- 
tures of the other three basic types rather than a unique category. The classification 
of the four groups is pictured in Figure 1.4. This section provides a survey of these 
materials. Chapters 6 through 9 cover the four material types in more detail. 
 
 
1.2.1 METALS 
 
Metals used in manufacturing are usually alloys, which are composed of two or 
more elements, with at least one being a metallic element. Metals and alloys can be 
divided into two basic groups: (1) ferrous, and (2) nonferrous.

Ferrous Metals Ferrous metals are based on iron; the group includes steel and cast 
iron. These metals constitute the most important group commercially, more than three-
fourths of the metal tonnage throughout the world. Pure iron has limited com- mercial 
use, but when alloyed with carbon, iron has more uses and greater commer- cial value 
than any other metal. Alloys of iron and carbon form steel and cast iron. 
Steel can be defined as an iron–carbon alloy containing 0.02% to 2.11% carbon. It 
is the most important category within the ferrous metal group. Its composition often 
includes other alloying elements as well, such as manganese, chromium, nickel, and 
molybdenum, to enhance the properties of the metal. Applications of steel include 
construction (bridges, I-beams, and nails), transportation (trucks, rails, and rolling 
stock for railroads), and consumer products (automobiles and appliances). 
Cast iron is an alloy of iron and carbon (2% to 4%) used in casting (primarily 
sand casting). Silicon is also present in the alloy (in amounts from 0.5% to 3%), and 
other elements are often added also, to obtain desirable properties in the cast part. 
Cast iron is available in several different forms, of which gray cast iron is the most 
common; its applications include blocks and heads for internal combustion engines. 
Nonferrous Metals Nonferrous metals include the other metallic elements and their 
alloys. In almost all cases, the alloys are more important commercially than the pure 
metals. The nonferrous metals include the pure metals and alloys of aluminum, copper, 
gold, magnesium, nickel, silver, tin, titanium, zinc, and other metals. 
 
1.2.2 CERAMICS 
 
A ceramic is defined as a compound containing metallic (or semimetallic) and nonme- 
tallic elements. Typical nonmetallic elements are oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon. Ceram- 
ics include a variety of traditional and modern materials. Traditional ceramics, some of 
which have been used for thousands of years, include: clay (abundantly available, con- 
sisting of fine particles of hydrous aluminum silicates and other minerals used in mak- 
ing brick, tile, and pottery); silica (the basis for nearly all glass products); and alumina 
and silicon carbide (two abrasive materials used in grinding). Modern ceramics include 
some of the preceding materials, such as alumina, whose properties are enhanced in 
various ways through modern processing methods. Newer ceramics include: carbides— 
metal carbides such as tungsten carbide and titanium carbide, which are widely used 
as cutting tool materials; and nitrides—metal and semimetal nitrides such as titanium 
nitride and boron nitride, used as cutting tools and grinding abrasives. 
For processing purposes, ceramics can be divided into crystalline ceramics and 
glasses. Different methods of manufacturing are required for the two types. 
Crystalline ceramics are formed in various ways from powders and then fired (heated 
to a temperature below the melting point to achieve bonding between the powders). 
The glass ceramics (namely, glass) can be melted and cast, and then formed in proc- 
esses such as traditional glass blowing.

A polymer is a compound formed of repeating structural units called mers, whose 
atoms share electrons to form very large molecules. Polymers usually consist of 
carbon plus one or more other elements such as hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and 
chlorine. Polymers are divided into three categories: (1) thermoplastic polymers, 
(2) thermosetting polymers, and (3) elastomers. 
Section 1.3/Manufacturing Processes 
11 
 
 
Thermoplastic polymers can be subjected to multiple heating and cooling cycles 
without substantially altering the molecular structure of the polymer. Common 
thermoplastics include polyethylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, and nylon. 
Thermosetting polymers chemically transform (cure) into a rigid structure upon 
cooling from a heated plastic condition; hence the name thermosetting. Members 
of this type include phenolics, amino resins, and epoxies. Although the name “ther- 
mosetting” is used, some of these polymers cure by mechanisms other than heating. 
Elastomers are polymers that exhibit significant elastic behavior; hence the name 
elastomer. They include natural rubber, neoprene, silicone, and polyurethane. 
 
 
1.2.4 COMPOSITES 
 
Composites do not really constitute a separate category of materials; they are mix- 
tures of the other three types. A composite is a material consisting of two or more 
phases that are processed separately and then bonded together to achieve proper- 
ties superior to those of its constituents. The term phase refers to a homogeneous 
mass of material, such as an aggregation of grains of identical unit cell structure in a 
solid metal. The usual structure of a composite consists of particles or fibers of one 
phase mixed in a second phase, called the matrix. 
Composites are found in nature (e.g., wood), and they can be produced synthetically. 
The synthesized type is of greater interest here, and it includes glass fibers in a polymer 
matrix, such as fiber-reinforced plastic; polymer fibers of one type in a matrix of a sec- 
ond polymer, such as an epoxy-Kevlar composite; and ceramic in a metal matrix, such 
as a tungsten carbide in a cobalt binder to form a cemented carbide cutting tool. 
Properties of a composite depend on its components, the physical shapes of the 
components, and the way they are combined to form the final material. Some com- 
posites combine high strength with light weight and are suited to applications such 
as aircraft components, car bodies, boat hulls, tennis rackets, and fishing rods. Other 
composites are strong, hard, and capable of maintaining these properties at elevated 
temperatures, for example, cemented carbide cutting tools. 
 
Manufacturing Processes 
A manufacturing process is a designed procedure that results in physical and/or 
chemical changes to a starting work material with the intention of increasing the 
value of that material. A manufacturing process is usually carried out as a unit oper- ation, 
which means that it is a single step in the sequence of steps required to trans- form 
the starting material into a final product. Manufacturing operations can be divided 
into two basic types: (1) processing operations and (2) assembly operations. A 
processing operation transforms a work material from one state of completion to 
a more advanced state that is closer to the final desired product. It adds value by 
changing the geometry, properties, or appearance of the starting material. In general, 
processing operations are performed on discrete work parts, but certain processing 
operations are also applicable to assembled items (e.g., painting a spot-welded car 
body). An assembly operation joins two or more components to create a new entity, 
called an assembly, subassembly, or some other term that refers to the joining proc- 
ess (e.g., a welded assembly is called a weldment). A classification of manufacturing 
processes is presented in Figure 1.5. Some of the basic processes used in modern 
manufacturing date from antiquity (Historical Note 1.2).

Manufacturing materials and processes 
 
Although most of the historical developments that form  
Gold was found by early humans in relatively pure form 
the modern practice of manufacturing have occurred  
in nature; it could be hammered into shape. Copper

several of the basic fabrication processes date as far thus requiring smelting as a processing technique.

Meteorites may have been one source of the metal,

but iron ore was also mined. Temperatures required to 
reduce iron ore to metal are significantly higher than for 
copper, which made furnace operations more difficult. 
Other processing methods were also more difficult for 
the same reason. Early blacksmiths learned that when 
certain irons (those containing small amounts of car- 
bon) were sufficiently heated and then quenched, 
they became very hard. This permitted grinding a very 
sharp cutting edge on knives and weapons, but it also 
made the metal brittle. Toughness could be increased 
by reheating at a lower temperature, a process known 
as tempering. What we have described is, of course, 
the heat treatment of steel. The superior properties of 
steel caused it to succeed bronze in many applica- 
tions (weaponry, agriculture, and mechanical devices). 
The period of its use has subsequently been named 
the Iron Age (starting around 1000 B.C.). It was not un- 
til much later, well into the nineteenth century, that the 
demand for steel grew significantly and more modern 
steelmaking techniques were developed (Historical 
Note 6.1). 
The beginnings of machine tool technology oc- 
curred during the Industrial Revolution. During the peri- 
od 1770–1850, machine tools were developed for most 
of the conventional material removal processes, 
such as boring, turning, drilling, milling, shaping, 
and planing (Historical Note 21.1). Many of the individ- 
ual processes predate the machine tools by centuries; 
for example, drilling and sawing (of wood) date from 
ancient times, and turning (of wood) from around the 
time of Christ. 
Assembly methods were used in ancient cultures to 
make ships, weapons, tools, farm implements, 
machinery, chariots and carts, furniture, and garments. 
The earliest processes included binding with twine 
and rope, riveting and nailing, and soldering. Around 
2000 years ago, forge welding and adhesive bond- 
ing had been developed. Widespread use of screws, 
bolts, and nuts as fasteners—so common in today’s 
assembly—required the development of machine tools 
that could accurately cut the required helical shapes 
(e.g., Maudsley’s screw cutting lathe, 1800). It was not 
until around 1900 that fusion welding proc- esses 
started to be developed as assembly techniques 
(Historical Note 28.1). 
Natural rubber was the first polymer to be used in 
manufacturing (if we exclude wood, which is a polymer 
composite). The vulcanization process, discovered by 
Charles Goodyear in 1839, made rubber a useful engi- 
neering material (Historical Note 8.2). Subsequent de- 
velopments included plastics such as cellulose nitrate 
in 1870, Bakelite in 1900, polyvinylchloride in 1927, pol- 
yethylene in 1932, and nylon in the late 1930s (Histori- 
cal Note 8.1). Processing requirements for plastics led 
to the development of injection molding (based on die 
casting, one of the metal casting processes) and other 
polymer shaping techniques. 
Electronics products have imposed unusual de- 
mands on manufacturing in terms of miniaturization. 
The evolution of the technology has been to package 
more and more devices into a smaller area—in some 
cases millions of transistors onto a flat piece of semi- 
conductor material that is only 12 mm (0.50 in) on a 
side. The history of electronics processing and pack- 
aging dates from around 1960 (Historical Notes 33.1, 
34.1, and 34.2). 
 
 
 
1.3.1 PROCESSING OPERATIONS 
 
A processing operation uses energy to alter a work part’s shape, physical properties, 
or appearance to add value to the material. The forms of energy include mechani- 
cal, thermal, electrical, and chemical. The energy is applied in a controlled way by 
means of machinery and tooling. Human energy may also be required, but the hu- 
man workers are generally employed to control the machines, oversee the opera- 
tions, and load and unload parts before and after each cycle of operation. A general 
model of a processing operation is illustrated in Figure 1.1(a). Material is fed into the 
process, energy is applied by the machinery and tooling to transform the material, 
and the completed work part exits the process. Most production operations produce 
waste or scrap, either as a natural aspect of the process (e.g., removing material as in 
machining) or in the form of occasional defective pieces. It is an important objective 
in manufacturing to reduce waste in either of these forms. 
More than one processing operation is usually required to transform the starting 
material into final form. The operations are performed in the particular sequence 
required to achieve the geometry and condition defined by the design specification. 
Section 1.3/Manufacturing Processes 
14 
 
 
Three categories of processing operations are distinguished: (1) shaping opera- 
tions, (2) property-enhancing operations, and (3) surface processing operations. 
Shaping operations alter the geometry of the starting work material by vari- 
ous methods. Common shaping processes include casting, forging, and machining. 
Property-enhancing operations add value to the material by improving its physical 
properties without changing its shape. Heat treatment is the most common example. 
Surface processing operations are performed to clean, treat, coat, or deposit mate- 
rial onto the exterior surface of the work. Common examples of coating are plating 
and painting. Shaping processes are covered in Parts III through VI, corresponding 
to the four main categories of shaping processes in Figure 1.5. Property-enhancing 
processes and surface processing operations are covered in Part VII. 
 
Shaping Processes Most shape processing operations apply heat, mechanical 
force or a combination of these to effect a change in geometry of the work material. 
There are various ways to classify the shaping processes. The classification used in this 
book is based on the state of the starting material, by which there are four categories: 
(1) solidification processes, in which the starting material is a heated liquid or semif- luid 
that cools and solidifies to form the part geometry; (2) particulate processing, in which 
the starting material is a powder, and the powders are formed and heated into the 
desired geometry; (3) deformation processes, in which the starting material is a 
ductile solid (commonly metal) that is deformed to shape the part; and (4) material 
removal processes, in which the starting material is a solid (ductile or brittle), from 
which material is removed so that the resulting part has the desired geometry. 
In the first category, the starting material is heated sufficiently to transform it into 
a liquid or highly plastic (semifluid) state. Nearly all materials can be processed in 
this way. Metals, ceramic glasses, and plastics can all be heated to sufficiently high 
temperatures to convert them into liquids. With the material in a liquid or semifluid 
form, it can be poured or otherwise forced to flow into a mold cavity and allowed to 
solidify, thus taking a solid shape that is the same as the cavity. Most processes that 
operate this way are called casting or molding. Casting is the name used for metals, 
and molding is the common term used for plastics. This category of shaping process 
is depicted in Figure 1.6. Figure 11.1 shows a cast iron casting, and a collection of 
plastic molded parts is displayed in Figure 13.20. 
In particulate processing, the starting materials are powders of metals or 
ceramics. Although these two materials are quite different, the processes to shape 
them in particulate processing are quite similar. The common technique in powder 
 
 
 
 
FIGURE 1.6 Casting 
and molding processes 
start with a work mate- 
rial heated to a fluid 
or semifluid state. The 
process consists of 
(1) pouring the fluid 
into a mold cavity and 
(2) allowing the fluid to 
solidify, after which the 
solid part is removed 
from the mold.

FIGURE 1.7 
Particulate processing: 
(1) the starting material 
is powder; the usual 
process consists of 
(2) pressing and 
(3) sintering. 
 
 
metallurgy involves pressing and sintering, illustrated in Figure 1.7, in which the 
powders are first squeezed into a die cavity under high pressure and then heated to 
bond the individual particles together. Examples of parts produced by powder 
metallurgy are shown in Figure 15.1. 
In the deformation processes, the starting work part is shaped by the application 
of forces that exceed the yield strength of the material. For the material to be formed 
in this way, it must be sufficiently ductile to avoid fracture during deformation. To 
increase ductility (and for other reasons), the work material is often heated before 
forming to a temperature below the melting point. Deformation processes are asso- 
ciated most closely with metalworking and include operations such as forging and 
extrusion, shown in Figure 1.8. Figure 18.19 shows a forging operation performed by 
a drop hammer. 
Also included within the deformation processes category is sheet metalworking, 
which involves bending, forming, and shearing operations performed on starting 
blanks and strips of sheet metal. Several sheet metal parts, called stampings because 
they are made on a stamping press, are illustrated in Figure 19.35. 
Material removal processes are operations that remove excess material from the 
starting workpiece so that the resulting shape is the desired geometry. The most 
important processes in this category are machining operations such as turning,

processes: (a) forging,

work part, causing it to

a billet is forced to flow 
through a die orifice, 
thus taking the cross- 
sectional shape of the 
orifice.

drilling, and milling, shown in Figure 1.9. These cutting operations are most com- 
monly applied to solid metals, performed using cutting tools that are harder and 
stronger than the work metal. 
The front cover of this book shows a turning operation. 
Grinding is another common material removal process. Other processes in this 
category are known as nontraditional processes because they use lasers, electron 
beams, chemical erosion, electric discharges, and electrochemical energy to remove 
material rather than cutting or grinding tools. 
It is desirable to minimize waste and scrap in converting a starting work part into 
its subsequent geometry. Certain shaping processes are more efficient than others in terms 
of material conservation. Material removal processes (e.g., machining) tend to be 
wasteful of material, simply by the way they work. The material removed from the starting 
shape is waste, at least in terms of the unit operation. Other processes, such as certain 
casting and molding operations, often convert close to 100% of the start- ing material 
into final product. Manufacturing processes that transform nearly all of the starting 
material into product and require no subsequent machining to achieve final part 
geometry are called net shape processes. Other processes require mini- mum 
machining to produce the final shape and are called near net shape processes. 
 
Property-Enhancing Processes The second major type of part processing is 
performed to improve mechanical or physical properties of the work material. 
These processes do not alter the shape of the part, except unintentionally in some 
cases. The most important property-enhancing processes involve heat treatments, 
which include various annealing and strengthening processes for metals and glasses. 
Sintering of powdered metals is also a heat treatment that strengthens a pressed 
powder metal work part. Its counterpart in ceramics is called firing. 
 
Surface Processing Surface processing operations include (1) cleaning, (2) sur- 
face treatments, and (3) coating and thin film deposition processes. Cleaning includes 
both chemical and mechanical processes to remove dirt, oil, and other contaminants 
from the surface. Surface treatments include mechanical working such as shot peen- 
ing and sand blasting, and physical processes such as diffusion and ion implanta- tion. 
Coating and thin film deposition processes apply a coating of material to the exterior 
surface of the work part. Common coating processes include electroplating, 
cutter

anodizing of aluminum, organic coating (call it painting), and porcelain enameling. 
Thin film deposition processes include physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor 
deposition to form extremely thin coatings of various substances. 
Several surface-processing operations have been adapted to fabricate semi- 
conductor materials into integrated circuits for microelectronics. These processes 
include chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, and oxidation. They 
are applied to very localized areas on the surface of a thin wafer of silicon (or other 
semiconductor material) to create the microscopic circuit. 
 
 
1.3.2 ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS 
 
The second basic type of manufacturing operation is assembly, in which two or more 
separate parts are joined to form a new entity. Components of the new entity are 
connected either permanently or semipermanently. Permanent joining processes 
include welding, brazing, soldering, and adhesive bonding. They form a joint be- 
tween components that cannot be easily disconnected. Certain mechanical assem- 
bly methods are available to fasten two (or more) parts together in a joint that can 
be conveniently disassembled. The use of screws, bolts, and other threaded fasten- 
ers are important traditional methods in this category. Other mechanical assembly 
techniques form a more permanent connection; these include rivets, press fitting, 
and expansion fits. Special joining and fastening methods are used in the assembly 
of electronic products. Some of the methods are identical to or are adaptations of 
the preceding processes, for example, soldering. Electronics assembly is concerned 
primarily with the assembly of components such as integrated circuit packages to 
printed circuit boards to produce the complex circuits used in so many of today’s 
products. Joining and assembly processes are discussed in Part VIII, and the special- 
ized assembly techniques for electronics are described in Chapter 34. 
 
 
1.3.3 PRODUCTION MACHINES AND TOOLING 
 
Manufacturing operations are accomplished using machinery and tooling (and peo- 
ple). The extensive use of machinery in manufacturing began with the Industrial 
Revolution. It was at that time that metal cutting machines started to be developed 
and widely used. These were called machine tools—power-driven machines used 
to operate cutting tools previously operated by hand. Modern machine tools are 
described by the same basic definition, except that the power is electrical rather than water 
or steam, and the level of precision and automation is much greater today. Machine 
tools are among the most versatile of all production machines. They are used to 
make not only parts for consumer products, but also components for other 
production machines. Both in a historic and a reproductive sense, the machine tool 
is the mother of all machinery. 
Other production machines include presses for stamping operations, forge ham- 
mers for forging, rolling mills for rolling sheet metal, welding machines for weld- 
ing, and insertion machines for inserting electronic components into printed circuit 
boards. The name of the equipment usually follows from the name of the process. 
Production equipment can be general purpose or special purpose. General purpose 
equipment is more flexible and adaptable to a variety of jobs. It is commercially availa- ble 
for any manufacturing company to invest in. Special purpose equipment is usually 
designed to produce a specific part or product in very large quantities. The economics

of mass production justify large investments in special purpose machinery to achieve high 
efficiencies and short cycle times. This is not the only reason for special purpose 
equipment, but it is the dominant one. Another reason may be because the process 
is unique and commercial equipment is not available. Some companies with unique 
processing requirements develop their own special purpose equipment. 
Production machinery usually requires tooling that customizes the equipment for 
the particular part or product. In many cases, the tooling must be designed specifically 
for the part or product configuration. When used with general purpose equipment, it is 
designed to be exchanged. For each work part type, the tooling is fastened to the 
machine and the production run is made. When the run is completed, the tooling is 
changed for the next work part type. When used with special purpose machines, the 
tooling is often designed as an integral part of the machine. Because the special purpose 
machine is likely being used for mass production, the tooling may never need changing 
except for replacement of worn components or for repair of worn surfaces. 
The type of tooling depends on the type of manufacturing process. In Table 1.3, 
we list examples of special tooling used in various operations. Details are provided 
in the chapters that discuss these processes. 
 
Production Systems 
To operate effectively, a manufacturing firm must have systems that allow it to ef- 
ficiently accomplish its type of production. Production systems consist of people, 
equipment, and procedures designed for the combination of materials and processes that 
constitute a firm’s manufacturing operations. Production systems can be divided into 
two categories: (1) production facilities and (2) manufacturing support systems, as 
shown in Figure 1.10.2 Production facilities refer to the physical equipment and the 
arrangement of equipment in the factory. Manufacturing support systems are

the procedures used by the company to manage production and solve the techni- 
cal and logistics problems encountered in ordering materials, moving work through 
the factory, and ensuring that products meet quality standards. Both categories in- 
clude people. People make these systems work. In general, direct labor workers are 
responsible for operating the manufacturing equipment; and professional staff 
workers are responsible for manufacturing support. 
 
 
1.4.1 PRODUCTION FACILITIES 
 
Production facilities consist of the factory and the production, material handling, 
and other equipment in the factory. The equipment comes in direct physical contact 
with the parts and/or assemblies as they are being made. The facilities “touch” the 
product. Facilities also include the way the equipment is arranged in the factory— 
the plant layout. The equipment is usually organized into logical groupings. In this 
book they are called manufacturing systems, such as an automated production line, 
or a machine cell consisting of an industrial robot and two machine tools. 
A manufacturing company attempts to design its manufacturing systems and 
organize its factories to serve the particular mission of each plant in the most effi- 
cient way. Over the years, certain types of production facilities have come to be 
recognized as the most appropriate way to organize for a given combination of prod- 
uct variety and production quantity, as discussed in Section 1.1.2. Different types of 
facilities are required for each of the three ranges of annual production quantities. 
 
Low-Quantity Production  In the low-quantity range (1–100 units/year), the term job 
shop is often used to describe the type of production facility. A job shop makes low 
quantities of specialized and customized products. The products are typically 
complex, such as space capsules, prototype aircraft, and special machinery. The 
equipment in a job shop is general purpose, and the labor force is highly skilled. 
A job shop must be designed for maximum flexibility to deal with the wide prod- 
uct variations encountered (hard product variety). If the product is large and heavy, 
and therefore difficult to move, it typically remains in a single location during its fab- 
rication or assembly. Workers and processing equipment are brought to the product, 
rather than moving the product to the equipment. This type of layout is referred to 
as a fixed-position layout, shown in Figure 1.11(a). In a pure situation, the product

remains in a single location during its entire production. Examples of such products 
include ships, aircraft, locomotives, and heavy machinery. In actual practice, these 
items are usually built in large modules at single locations, and then the completed 
modules are brought together for final assembly using large-capacity cranes. 
The individual components of these large products are often made in factories in 
which the equipment is arranged according to function or type. This arrangement 
is called a process layout. The lathes are in one department, the milling machines 
are in another department, and so on, as in Figure 1.11(b). Different parts, each 
requiring a different operation sequence, are routed through the departments in the 
particular order needed for their processing, usually in batches. The process layout 
is noted for its flexibility; it can accommodate a great variety of operation sequences 
for different part configurations. Its disadvantage is that the machinery and methods to 
produce a part are not designed for high efficiency. 
 
Medium Quantity Production 
In the medium-quantity range (100–10,000 units 
annually), two different types of facility are distinguished, depending on product 
variety. When product variety is hard, the usual approach is batch production, in 
which a batch of one product is made, after which the manufacturing equipment is 
changed over to produce a batch of the next product, and so on. The production rate 
of the equipment is greater than the demand rate for any single product type, and so 
the same equipment can be shared among multiple products. The changeover between 
production runs takes time—time to change tooling and set up the machin- ery. This 
setup time is lost production time, and this is a disadvantage of batch manu- facturing. 
Batch production is commonly used for make-to-stock situations, in which

items are manufactured to replenish inventory that has been gradually depleted by 
demand. The equipment is usually arranged in a process layout, as in Figure 1.11(b). 
An alternative approach to medium-range production is possible if product vari- 
ety is soft. In this case, extensive changeovers between one product style and the 
next may not be necessary. It is often possible to configure the manufacturing sys- 
tem so that groups of similar products can be made on the same equipment without 
significant lost time because of setup. The processing or assembly of different parts 
or products is accomplished in cells consisting of several workstations or machines. 
The term cellular manufacturing is often associated with this type of production. 
Each cell is designed to produce a limited variety of part configurations; that is, the 
cell specializes in the production of a given set of similar parts, according to the 
principles of group technology (Section 39.5). The layout is called a cellular layout, 
depicted in Figure 1.11(c). 
High Production The high-quantity range (10,000 to millions of units per year) is 
referred to as mass production. The situation is characterized by a high demand rate 
for the product, and the manufacturing system is dedicated to the production of that 
single item. Two categories of mass production can be distinguished: quantity produc- tion 
and flow line production. Quantity production involves the mass production of 
single parts on single pieces of equipment. It typically involves standard machines 
(e.g., stamping presses) equipped with special tooling (e.g., dies and material handling 
devices), in effect dedicating the equipment to the production of one part type. Typi- 
cal layouts used in quantity production are the process layout and cellular layout. 
Flow line production involves multiple pieces of equipment or workstations 
arranged in sequence, and the work units are physically moved through the sequence to 
complete the product. The workstations and equipment are designed specifically for 
the product to maximize efficiency. The layout is called a product layout, and the 
workstations are arranged into one long line, as in Figure 1.11(d), or into a series of 
connected line segments. The work is usually moved between stations by mecha- 
nized conveyor. At each station, a small amount of the total work is completed on 
each unit of product. 
The most familiar example of flow line production is the assembly line, associ- 
ated with products such as cars and household appliances. The pure case of flow line 
production occurs when there is no variation in the products made on the line. Every 
product is identical, and the line is referred to as a single model production line. To 
successfully market a given product, it is often beneficial to introduce feature and 
model variations so that individual customers can choose the exact merchandise that 
appeals to them. From a production viewpoint, the feature differences represent a 
case of soft product variety. The term mixed-model production line applies to these 
situations in which there is soft variety in the products made on the line. Modern 
automobile assembly is an example. Cars coming off the assembly line have varia- 
tions in options and trim representing different models and in many cases different 
nameplates of the same basic car design. 
 
1.4.2 MANUFACTURING SUPPORT SYSTEMS 
 
To operate its facilities efficiently, a company must organize itself to design the proc- esses 
and equipment, plan and control the production orders, and satisfy product quality 
requirements. These functions are accomplished by manufacturing sup- port 
systems—people and procedures by which a company manages its production 
Section 1.4/Production Systems 
22 
 
 
operations. Most of these support systems do not directly contact the product, but 
they plan and control its progress through the factory. Manufacturing support func- 
tions are often carried out in the firm by people organized into departments such as 
the following: 
 
➢ Manufacturing engineering. The manufacturing engineering department is re- 
sponsible for planning the manufacturing processes—deciding what processes 
should be used to make the parts and assemble the products. This department is 
also involved in designing and ordering the machine tools and other equipment 
used by the operating departments to accomplish processing and assembly. 
➢ Production planning and control. This department is responsible for solv- ing 
the logistics problem in manufacturing—ordering materials and purchased 
parts, scheduling production, and making sure that the operating departments 
have the necessary capacity to meet the production schedules. 
➢ Quality control. Producing high-quality products should be a top priority of any 
manufacturing firm in today’s competitive environment. It means designing and 
building products that conform to specifications and satisfy or exceed customer 
expectations. Much of this effort is the responsibility of the QC department. 
 
Manufacturing Economics 
In Section 1.1.1, manufacturing was defined as a transformation process that adds 
value to a starting work material. In Section 1.1.2, we noted that manufacturing is 
a commercial activity performed by companies that sell products to customers. It is 
appropriate to consider some of the economic aspects of manufacturing, and that is 
the purpose of this section. Our coverage consists of (1) production cycle time analy- 
sis and (2) manufacturing cost models. 
 
 
1.5.1 
PRODUCTION CYCLE TIME ANALYSIS 
 
“Time is money”, as the saying goes. The total time to make a product is one of the 
components that determine its total cost and the price that can be charged for it. The 
total time is the sum of all of the individual cycle times of the unit operations needed 
to manufacture the product. As defined in Section 1.3, a unit operation is a single step 
in the sequence of steps required to make the final product. The cycle time of a unit 
operation is defined as the time that one work unit spends being processed or assem- 
bled. It is the time interval between when one work unit begins the operation and 
the next unit begins. A typical production cycle time consists of the actual processing time 
plus the work handling time, for example, loading and unloading the part in the 
machine. In some processes, such as machining, time is also required to periodically 
change the tooling used in the operation when it wears out. In equation form, 
Tc = To 1 Th 1 Tt 
(1.1) 
where Tc = cycle time of the unit operation, min/pc; To = actual processing time in 
the operation, min/pc; Th = work handling time, min/pc; and Tt = tool handling time 
if that applies in the operation, min/pc. As indicated, the tool handling time usually 
occurs periodically, not every cycle, so the time per workpiece must be determined 
by dividing the actual time associated with changing the tool by the number of pieces 
.5 
Section 1.5/Manufacturing Economics 
23 
 
 
between tool changes. It should be mentioned that many production operations do 
not include a tool change, so that term is omitted from Equation (1.1) in those cases. 
Batch and job shop production are common types of manufacturing. The time 
to produce a batch of parts in a unit operation consists of the time to set up for the 
batch plus the actual run time. This can be summarized as follows: 
 
Tb = Tsu + QTc 
(1.2) 
 
where Tb = total time to complete the batch, min/batch; Tsu = setup time, min/batch; 
Q = batch quantity, number of pieces (pc); and Tc = cycle time as defined in Equa- 
tion (1.1), min/pc. To obtain a realistic value of the average production time per 
piece, the setup time is spread over the batch quantity, as follows: 
T = Tsu + T = Tsu + QTc = Tb  
(1.3) 
 
 
p 
Q 
c 
Q 
Q 
where Tp = average production time per piece, min/pc; and the other terms are de- 
fined above. 
If the batch size is one part, then Equations (1.2) and (1.3) are still applicable, and 
Q = 1. In high production (mass production), these equations can also be used, but 
the value of Q is so large that the setup time loses significance: As Q → oo, Tsu/Q → 0. 
The average production time per piece in Equation (1.3) can be used to deter- 
mine the actual average production rate in the operation: 
R = 60 
p 
Tp
 
 
(1.4) 
where Rp = average hourly production rate, pc/hr. This production rate includes the 
effect of setup time. During the production run (after the machine is set up), the 
production rate is the reciprocal of the cycle time: 
R = 60 
c 
Tc
 
 
(1.5) 
where Rc = hourly cycle rate, cycles/hr or pc/hr. These equations indicate that the 
cycle rate will always be larger than the actual production rate unless the setup time 
is zero (Rc > Rp). 
 
 
1.5.2 MANUFACTURING COST MODELS 
 
In this section, the cycle time analysis is used to estimate the costs of production, 
which include not only the cost of time but also material and overhead. The cost of 
time consists of labor and equipment costs, which are applied to the average produc- 
tion time per piece as cost rates (e.g., $/hr). Thus, our cost model for production cost 
per piece can be stated as follows: 
Cpc = Cm + (CL + Ceq)Tp + Ct 
(1.6) 
where Cpc = cost per piece, $/pc; Cm = starting material cost, $/pc; CL = labor cost 
rate, $/min; Ceq = equipment cost rate, $/min; Ct = cost of tooling that is used in the 
unit operation, $/pc; and Tp = average production time per piece, min/pc. If appli- 
cable, the cost of tooling Ct must be determined by dividing the actual cost of the 
tooling by the number of pieces between tool changes. 
Section 1.5/Manufacturing Economics 
24 
 
 
Overhead Costs The two cost rates, CL and Ceq, include overhead costs, which 
consist of all of the expenses of operating the company other than material, labor, 
and equipment. Overhead costs can be divided into two categories: (1) factory over- 
head and (2) corporate overhead. Factory overhead consists of the costs of running 
the factory excluding materials, direct labor, and equipment. This overhead category 
includes plant supervision, maintenance, insurance, heat and light, and so forth. A 
worker who operates a piece of equipment may earn an hourly wage of $15/hr, but 
when fringe benefits and other overhead costs are figured in, the worker may cost 
the company $30/hr. Corporate overhead consists of company expenses not related 
to the factory, such as sales, marketing, accounting, legal, engineering, research and 
development, office space, utilities, and health benefits.3 These functions are required in 
the company, but they are not directly related to the cost of manufacturing. On the other 
hand, for pricing the product, they must be added in, or else the company will lose 
money on every product it sells. 
J Black [1] offers some estimates of the typical costs associated with manufac- 
turing a product, presented in Figure 1.12. Several observations are worth making 
here. First, total manufacturing costs constitute only 40% of the product’s selling 
price. Corporate overhead expenses (Engineering, Research and development, 
Administration, sales, marketing, etc.) add up to almost as much as manufacturing 
cost. Second, parts and materials are 50% of total manufacturing cost, so that is 
about 20% of selling price. Third, direct labor is only about 12% of manufacturing 
cost, so that is less than 5% of selling price. Factory overhead, which includes the 
categories Plant and machinery, depreciation, energy at 26% and Indirect labor at 
12%, adds up to more than three times Direct labor cost. 
The issue of overhead costs can become quite complicated. A more complete 
treatment can be found in [7] and most introductory accounting textbooks. Our 
approach in this book is simply to include an appropriate overhead expense in our 
labor and equipment cost rates. For example, the labor cost rate is 
RH 
C = 
(1 + R  
) 
(1.7)

LOH 
where CL = labor cost rate, $/min; RH = worker’s hourly wage rate, $/hr; and RLOH = 
labor overhead rate, %.

Equipment Cost Rate The cost of production equipment used in the factory is a 
fixed cost, meaning that it remains constant for any level of production output. It is 
a capital investment that is made in the hope that it will pay for itself by producing 
a revenue stream that ultimately exceeds its cost. The company puts up the money 
to purchase the equipment as an initial cost, and then the equipment pays back over 
a certain number of years until it is replaced or disposed of. This is different from 
direct labor and material costs, which are variable costs, meaning they are paid for 
as they are used. Direct labor cost is a cost per time ($/min), and Material cost is a 
cost per piece ($/pc). 
In order to determine an equipment cost rate, the initial cost plus installation cost 
of the equipment must be amortized over the number of minutes it is used during its 
lifetime. The equipment cost rate is defined by the following: 
Ceq =  IC  (1 + ROH) 
(1.8) 
60NH 
where Ceq = equipment cost rate, $/min; IC = initial cost of the equipment, $; N = 
anticipated number of years of service; H = annual number of hours of operation, 
hr/yr; and ROH = applicable overhead rate for the equipment, %. 
 
 
Example 1.1 
Equipment 
cost rate 
A production machine is purchased for an initial cost plus installation of 
$500,000. Its anticipated life = 7 years. The machine is planned for a two-shift 
operation, eight hours per shift, and five days per week. Assume 50 weeks per 
year. The applicable overhead rate on this type of equipment = 35%. Deter- 
mine the equipment cost rate. 
Solution: The number of hours of operation per year H = 50(2)(5)(8) = 
4000 hr/yr. Using Equation (1.8), we have 
Ceq =   500,000  (1 + 0.35) = $0.402/min == $24.11/hr 
60(7)(4000) 
 
 
 
 
Example 1.2 
Cycle time and 
cost per piece 
The production machine in Example 1.1 is used to produce a batch of parts 
that each has a starting material cost = $2.35. Batch quantity = 100. The actual 
processing time in the operation = 3.72 min. Time to load and unload each 
workpiece = 1.60 min. Tool cost = $4.40, and each tool can be used for 20 
pieces before it is changed, which takes 2.0 min. Before production can begin, 
the machine must be set up, which takes 2.5 hr. Hourly wage rate of the opera- 
tor = $16.50/hr, and the applicable labor overhead rate = 40%. Determine (a) 
the cycle time for the piece, (b) average production rate when setup time is 
figured in, and (c) cost per piece. 
Solution: (a) For Equation (1.1), processing time To = 3.72 min, part handling 
time Th = 1.50 min, and tool handling time Tt = 2.00 min/20 = 0.10 min. 
Tc = 3.72 + 1.60 + 0.10 = 5.42 min/pc

Equipment reliability and scrap rate of parts are sometimes issues in produc- 
tion. Equipment reliability is represented by the term availability (denoted by the 
symbol A), which is simply the proportion uptime of the equipment. For example, if 
A = 97%, then for every 100 hours of machine operation, we would expect on aver- 
age that the machine would be running for 97 hours and be down for maintenance 
and repairs for 3 hours. Scrap rate refers to the proportion of parts produced that 
are defective. Let q denote the scrap rate. In batch production, more than the speci- 
fied batch quantity are often produced to compensate for the losses due to scrap. 
Let Q = the required quantity of parts to be delivered and Qo = the starting quan- 
tity. The following equation can be used to determine how many starting parts are 
needed on average to satisfy an order for Q finished parts: 
Q 
Qo = 1 - 
q 
 
(1.9) 
 
Example 1.3 
Scrap rate 
A customer has ordered a batch of 1,000 parts to be produced by a machine 
shop. Historical data indicates that the scrap rate on this type of part = 4%. 
How many parts should the machine shop plan to make in order to account 
for this scrap rate? 
Solution: Given Q = 1,000 parts and q = 4% = 0.04, then the starting quan- 
tity is determined as follows: 
Q =  1000  
= 1000 = 1041.7 rounded to 1042 starting parts

Of course, in modern manufacturing practice, every effort is made to minimize scrap 
rate, with the goal being zero defects. Availability and scrap rate also figure into cal- 
culations of production rate and part cost, as demonstrated in Example 1.4.

Example 1.4 
Cycle time and 
cost per piece 
A high-production operation manufactures a part for the automotive indus- 
try. Starting material cost = $1.75, and cycle time = 2.20 min. Equipment cost 
rate = $42.00/hr, and labor cost rate = $24.00/hr, including overhead costs in 
both cases. Availability of the production machine in this job = 97%, and the 
scrap rate of parts produced = 5%. Because this is a long-running job, setup 
time is ignored, and there is no tooling cost to be considered. (a) Determine 
the production rate and finished part cost in this operation. (b) If availability 
could be increased to 100% and scrap rate could be reduced to 0, what would 
be the production rate and finished part cost? 
Solution: (a) Production rate, including effect of availability 
R =  60  (0.97) = 26.45 pc/hr 
p 
2.20 
However, because of the 5% scrap rate, the production rate of acceptable 
parts is 
Rp = 26.45(1 - 
0.05) = 25.13 pc/hr 
Because of availability and scrap rate, the part cost is 
Cpc =  
1.75 
 + 
( 
2.20 
) 
= $4.47/pc 
(24 + 42) 
(1 - 
0.05) 
(0.97) 
60(1 - 
0.05) 
(b) If A = 100% and q = 0,  Rp =  60  = 27.27 pc/hr. 
2.20 
Part cost Cpc = 1.75 + (42 + 24)(2.20/60) = $4.17/pc. 
This is an 8.5% increase in production rate and a 6.7% reduction in cost. 
 
 
Recent Developments in Manufacturing 
Manufacturing materials, processes, and systems have been the object of devel- 
opment for thousands of years (Historical Notes 1.1 and 1.2). In this section, we 
want to focus on developments that are of more recent vintage, say within the last 
25 to 50 years. The discussion is organized around the following topic areas: 
(1) microelectronics, (2) computerization of manufacturing, (3) flexible manufactur- 
ing, (4) microfabrication and nanotechnology, (5) lean production and Six Sigma, 
(6) globalization, and (7) environmentally conscious manufacturing. 
 
Microelectronics Microelectronics involves electronic devices that are fabri- 
cated on a microscopic scale. Examples include integrated circuits, which consist of 
components such as transistors, diodes, and resistors that have been fabricated and 
electrically connected on a small flat chip, usually made of silicon. The remarkable 
feature about today’s microelectronics devices is the huge number of components 
that can be contained onto the chip. The capability to fabricate integrated circuits 
dates from the early 1960s and has advanced to the point where the current technol- 
ogy is called giga-scale integration, meaning that chips are being produced consist- 
ing of billions of components. Microelectronics has become so pervasive that a large 
.6 
Section 1.6/Recent Developments in Manufacturing 
28 
 
 
proportion of the common items used today are based on this technology. Two thirds 
of the products listed in Table 1.1 are either called electronics products or their func- 
tion and operation depend on electronics. In this book, the fabrication of integrated 
circuits is covered in Chapter 33 and electronics assembly in Chapter 34. 
 
Computerization of Manufacturing The first digital computers date from the 
mid-1940s, but their applications in manufacturing came quite a few years later. In the 
mid-1960s direct numerical control was developed, in which mainframe com- puters 
were employed to remotely control machine tools in factories. As computer technology 
developed, enabled by advances in microelectronics, the cost of comput- ers and data 
processing was reduced, leading to the widespread use of personal com- puters, not 
only in the office but also in the factory for tasks ranging from control of individual 
equipment on the shop floor to control of the information required to manage the entire 
enterprise. The Internet has allowed manufacturing companies to communicate among 
their own geographically distributed plants and offices, and it has also provided access 
to customers and suppliers around the world. In this book, several aspects of 
computerization of manufacturing are included in Parts X and XI on manufacturing 
systems (Chapters 37 and 38) and manufacturing support systems (Chapters 39 and 
40). 
 
Flexible Manufacturing During most of the twentieth century, the emphasis in 
the manufacturing industries in the United States was on mass production to sat- 
isfy the consumer demands of a rapidly growing population. Mass production is still 
widely used in the United States and throughout the world, but computerization has 
enabled manufacturing companies to develop systems that are able to cope with 
product variations. The reader encountered several instances of this manufacturing 
flexibility in Section 1.4.1 in the discussion of production facilities. Cellular manu- 
facturing and mixed-model assembly lines are two examples of manually operated 
manufacturing systems that are capable of producing a variety of parts or products 
without the time-consuming downtime for changeover. The automobile industry, in 
particular, is designing its final assembly lines so that ever-greater model variations 
can be accommodated on a single line to meet changing and unpredictable demand 
patterns. Computerization has also allowed flexibility to be designed into automated 
systems, examples of which are the flexible manufacturing systems discussed in Sec- tion 
38.6. 
Closely related to flexible manufacturing is mass customization, which involves 
a production system that is capable of producing individualized products for each 
customer. The customer specifies the model and options, and the product is made to 
those specifications. Mass customization is discussed in Section 38.6.3. 
 
Microfabrication and Nanotechnology Another recent development in manu- 
facturing, closely related to microelectronics, is the introduction of materials and 
products whose dimensions are sometimes so small that they cannot be seen by the 
naked eye. In extreme cases, the items cannot even be seen under an optical micro- 
scope. Products that are so miniaturized require special fabrication technologies. 
Microfabrication refers to the processes needed to make parts and products whose 
features sizes are in the micrometer range (1 mm = 10-3 mm = 10-6m). Examples 
include ink-jet printing heads, compact discs (CDs and DVDs), and microsensors used 
in automotive applications (e.g., air-bag deployment sensors). Nanotechnol- ogy 
refers to materials and products whose feature sizes are in the nanometer scale 
Section 1.6/Recent Developments in Manufacturing 
29 
 
 
(1 nm = 10-3 mm = 10-6 mm = 10-9m), a scale that approaches the size of atoms and 
molecules. Ultra-thin coatings for catalytic converters, flat screen TV monitors, and 
cancer drugs are examples of products based on nanotechnology. The technological 
and economic importance of microscopic and nanoscopic materials and products is 
expected to increase in the future, and processes are needed to produce them com- 
mercially. Chapters 35 and 36 are devoted to these technologies. 
 
Lean Production and Six Sigma These are two programs aimed at improving 
efficiency and quality in manufacturing. They address demands by customers for 
products they buy to be both low in cost and high in quality. Lean production and Six 
Sigma are being widely adopted by companies, especially in the United States. 
Lean production is based on the Toyota Production System developed by Toyota 
Motors in Japan. Its origins date from the 1950s and 1960s when Toyota began using 
unconventional approaches to improve quality, reduce inventories, and increase 
flexibility in its operations. Lean production can be defined simply as “doing more 
work with fewer resources.”4 It means that fewer workers and less equipment are 
used to accomplish more production in less time, and yet achieve higher quality in 
the final product. The underlying objective of lean production is the elimination of 
various forms of waste, such as producing defective parts, excessive inventories, and 
workers waiting. Lean production is described in Sections 39.4 and 39.5 in our chap- 
ter on process planning and production control. 
Six Sigma was started in the 1980s at Motorola Corporation in the United States. 
The objective was to reduce variability in the company’s processes and products to 
increase customer satisfaction. Today, Six Sigma can be defined as “a quality-focused 
program that utilizes worker teams to accomplish projects aimed at improving an 
organization’s operational performance.”5 Six Sigma is discussed in more detail in 
Section 40.4.2. 
 
Globalization and Outsourcing The world is becoming more and more inte- 
grated, creating an international economy in which barriers once established by 
national boundaries have been reduced or eliminated. This has enabled a freer flow 
of goods and services, capital, technology, and people among regions and countries. 
Globalization is the term that describes this trend, which was recognized in the late 
1980s and is now a dominant economic reality. Of interest here is that once under- 
developed nations such as China, India, and Mexico have developed their manufac- 
turing infrastructures and technologies to a level such that they are now important 
producers in the global economy. These countries have large populations, and there- 
fore large workforces, and low labor costs. Hourly wages are significantly higher 
in the United States than in these countries, making it difficult for domestic U.S. 
companies to compete in many products that require high labor content. Examples 
include garments, furniture, toys, and electronic consumer products. The result has 
been a loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States and a gain of related work to 
these countries. 
Outsourcing is closely related to globalization. In manufacturing, outsourc- ing 
refers to the use of outside contractors to perform work that was traditionally 
 
4 M. P. Groover, Work Systems and the Methods, Measurement, and Management of Work [8], p. 514. The 
term lean production was coined by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studied 
the production operations at Toyota and other automobile companies in the 1980s. 
5 Ibid, p. 541. 
Section 1.6/Recent Developments in Manufacturing

accomplished in-house. Outsourcing can be done in several ways, including the use 
of local suppliers. In this case the jobs remain in the United States. Alternatively, 
U.S. companies can outsource to foreign countries, so that parts and products once 
made in the United States are now made outside the country. In this case U.S. jobs 
are displaced. Two possibilities can be distinguished: (1) offshore outsourcing, which 
refers to production in China or other overseas locations and transporting the items 
by cargo ship to the United States, and (2) near-shore outsourcing, which means the items 
are made in Canada, Mexico, or Central America and shipped by rail or truck into 
the United States. 
Outsourcing has resulted in the growth of contract manufacturers, companies 
that specialize in producing parts, subassemblies, and/or products for other com- 
panies. Contract manufacturers have developed expertise and efficiencies in cer- 
tain manufacturing operations, which means they can likely produce the contracted 
items at prices that are lower than the production costs of the customer company if 
it were the producer. Contract manufacturers include both domestic (U.S.) and 
foreign companies.6 Reasons why a company might prefer to use the services of a 
contract manufacturer include: (1) the company benefits from cost savings because 
it does not have to pay the factory expenses associated with production, (2) the 
company can focus its resources on design and marketing of products rather than 
manufacturing, and (3) the company may benefit from skills possessed by the con- 
tract manufacturer but not by itself. On the other hand, there are risks associated 
with contract manufacturing by the customer company. In turning over its prod- 
uct designs it loses control over its intellectual property, which might result in the 
contract manufacturer becoming a competitor. The distinction between a contract 
manufacturer and a supplier is perhaps subtle. A supplier is usually thought of as a 
company that provides materials and components for a customer who is engaged in 
production of a product, whereas a contract manufacturer accomplishes the whole 
production of the product. It may use suppliers itself. 
China is of particular interest in this discussion of globalization and outsourcing 
because of (1) its fast-growing economy (it now boasts the second largest gross domes- tic 
product in the world), (2) the importance of manufacturing in that economy, and 
(3) the extent to which U.S. companies have outsourced work to China. To take advan- tage 
of the low labor rates, many U.S. companies have moved much of their production to 
China (and other east Asian countries). Despite the logistics problems and costs of 
shipping the goods back into the United States, the result has been lower costs and 
higher profits for the outsourcing companies, as well as lower prices and a wider 
variety of available products for American consumers. The downside has been the loss 
of well-paying manufacturing jobs in the United States. Another consequence of U.S. 
outsourcing to China has been a reduction in the relative contribution of the manufac- 
turing sector to GDP. In the 1990s, the manufacturing industries accounted for about 
20% of GDP in the United States. Today, that contribution is only about 12%. At the 
same time, the manufacturing sector in China has grown (along with the rest of its 
economy), now accounting for about 35% of Chinese GDP. 
Recently, there have been signs that outsourcing of production to China by 
American companies may be declining, and that manufacturing jobs are being 
brought back to the U.S. There are several reasons for this trend, which is called

reshoring. First, wage rates in China are increasing as the 
government attempts to evolve from an export-driven economy 
to a consumer-oriented economy, similar to the United States. 
Higher Chinese wage rates mean less advantage for U.S. 
compa- nies to offshore jobs to China. Second, logistics costs 
and delays involved in trans- porting products from China to North 
America are significant, especially as oil prices increase. 
Accordingly, some companies, in their analyses of costs and 
benefits, have decided to produce in the United States, re-
opening old factories or building new ones. On the other hand, 
U.S. companies producing goods for the Chinese market still have 
good reasons to keep their operations going in that country, just as 
Japanese and German automobile makers have established 
plants in the United States. 
 
Environmentally Conscious Manufacturing 
An inherent 
feature of virtually all manufacturing processes is waste (Section 
1.3.1). The most obvious examples are material removal 
processes, in which chips are removed from a starting 
workpiece to create the desired part geometry. Waste in one 
form or another is a by-product of nearly all production 
operations. Another unavoidable aspect of manufacturing is 
that power is required to accomplish any given process. 
Generating that power requires fossil fuels (at least in the 
United States and China), the burning of which results in 
pollution of the environment. At the end of the manufacturing 
sequence, a product is created that is sold to a customer. 
Ultimately, the product wears out and is disposed of, perhaps in 
some landfill, with the associated environmental degrada- tion. 
More and more attention is being paid by society to the 
environmental impact of human activities throughout the world 
and how modern civilization is using our natural resources at an 
unsustainable rate. Global warming is presently a major con- 
cern. The manufacturing industries contribute to these 
problems. 
Environmentally conscious manufacturing refers to programs 
that seek to deter- mine the most efficient use of materials and 
natural resources in production and minimize the negative 
consequences on the environment. Other terms for these pro- grams 
include green manufacturing and sustainable manufacturing. 
They all boil down to two basic approaches: (1) design products 
that minimize their environmen- tal impact and (2) design 
processes that are environmentally friendly. 
Product 
design 
is 
the 
logical 
starting 
point 
in 
environmentally conscious manu- facturing. The term design 
for environment (DFE) is used for the techniques that attempt 
to consider environmental impact during product design prior 
to produc- tion. Considerations in DFE include (1) selecting 
materials that require minimum energy to produce, (2) 
selecting processes that minimize waste of materials and 
energy, (3) designing parts that can be recycled or reused, (4) 
designing products that can be readily disassembled to recover 
the parts, (5) designing products that minimize the use of 
hazardous and toxic materials, and (6) giving attention to how

the product will be disposed of at the end of its useful life. 
To a great degree, decisions made during design dictate the 
materials and processes that are used to make the product. These 
decisions limit the options available to the manufacturing 
departments to achieve sustainability. However, various 
approaches can be applied to make plant operations more 
environmentally friendly. They include 
(1) adopting good housekeeping practices—keeping the factory 
clean, (2) preventing pollutants from escaping into the environment 
(rivers and atmosphere), (3) minimiz- ing waste of materials in 
unit operations, (4) recycling rather than discarding waste 
materials, (5) using net shape processes, (6) using renewable 
energy sources when feasible, (7) maintaining production 
equipment so that it operates at maximum effi- ciency, and (8) 
investing in equipment that minimizes power requirements.

The Nature of 
Materials 
 
 
 
 
An understanding of materials is fundamental in the 
study of manufacturing processes. In Chapter 1, manu- 
facturing was defined as a transformation process. It is 
the material that is transformed; and it is the behavior 
of the material when subjected to the particular forces, 
temperatures, and other physical parameters of the 
process that determines the success of the operation. 
Certain materials respond well to certain types of manu- 
facturing processes and poorly or not at all to others. 
What are the characteristics and properties of materials 
that determine their capacity to be transformed by the 
different processes? 
Part I of this book consists of four chapters that 
address this question. The current chapter considers the 
atomic structure of matter and the bonding bet- ween 
atoms and molecules. It also shows how atoms and 
molecules in engineering materials organize themselves 
into two structural forms: crystalline and noncrystalline. 
It turns out that the basic engineering materials—metals, 
ceramics, and polymers—can exist in either form, 
although a preference for a particular form is usually 
exhibited by a given material. For exam- ple, metals 
almost always exist as crystals in their solid state. Glass 
(e.g., window glass), a ceramic, assumes a noncrystalline 
form. Some polymers are mixtures of crystalline and 
amorphous structures. 
Chapters 3 and 4 discuss the mechanical and physical 
properties that are relevant in manufacturing. Of course, 
these properties are also important in product design. 
Chapter 5 is concerned with several part and product

attributes that are specified during product design and must be achieved in manufac- turing: 
dimensions, tolerances, and surface finish. Chapter 5 also describes how these attributes 
are measured. 
 
Atomic Structure and the Elements 
The basic structural unit of matter is the atom. Each atom is composed of a positively 
charged nucleus, surrounded by a sufficient number of negatively charged electrons so that 
the charges are balanced. The number of electrons identifies the atomic number and 
the element of the atom. There are slightly more than 100 elements (not counting a few 
extras that have been artificially synthesized), and these elements are the chemi- cal 
building blocks of all matter. 
Just as there are differences among the elements, there are also similarities. The 
elements can be grouped into families and relationships established between and 
within the families by means of the Periodic Table, shown in Figure 2.1. In the 
horizontal direction there is a certain repetition, or periodicity, in the arrange- ment 
of elements. Metallic elements occupy the left and center portions of the chart, and 
nonmetals are located to the right. Between them, along a diagonal, is a transition 
zone containing elements called metalloids or semimetals. In principle, each of the 
elements can exist as a solid, liquid, or gas, depending on temperature and pressure. 
At room temperature and atmospheric pressure, they each have a natural phase; 
e.g., iron (Fe) is a solid, mercury (Hg) is a liquid, and nitrogen (N) is a gas. 
 
 
 
FIGURE 2.1  Periodic Table of Elements. The atomic number and symbol are listed for the 103 elements.

Section 2.1/Atomic Structure and the Elements 
38 
 
 
In the table, the elements are arranged into vertical columns and horizontal rows 
in such a way that similarities exist among elements in the same columns. For exam- 
ple, in the extreme right column are the noble gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton, 
xenon, and radon), all of which exhibit great chemical stability and low reaction 
rates. The halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine) in column 
VIIA share similar properties (hydrogen is not included among the halogens). The 
noble metals (copper, silver, and gold) in column IB have similar properties. Gen- 
erally, there are correlations in properties among elements within a given column, 
whereas differences exist among elements in different columns. 
Many of the similarities and differences among the elements can be explained by their 
respective atomic structures. The simplest model of atomic structure, called the 
planetary model, shows the electrons of the atom orbiting around the nucleus at 
certain fixed distances, called shells, as shown in Figure 2.2. The hydrogen atom 
(atomic number 1) has one electron in the orbit closest to the nucleus. Helium 
(atomic number 2) has two. Also shown in the figure are the atomic structures 
for fluorine (atomic number 9), neon (atomic number 10), and sodium (atomic 
number 11). One might infer from these models that there is a maximum number 
of electrons that can be contained in a given orbit. This turns out to be correct, and 
the maximum is defined by 
Maximum number of electrons in an orbit = 2n2 
where n identifies the orbit, with n = 1 closest to the nucleus. 
The number of electrons in the outermost shell, relative to the maximum 
number allowed, determines to a large extent the atom’s chemical affinity for 
other atoms. These outer-shell electrons are called valence electrons. For exam- 
ple, because a hydrogen atom has only one electron in its single orbit, it readily 
combines with another hydrogen atom to form a hydrogen molecule H2. For the 
same reason, hydrogen also reacts readily with various other elements (e.g., to 
form H2O). In the helium atom, the two electrons in its only orbit are the maxi- 
mum allowed (2n2 = 2(1)2 = 2), and so helium is very stable. Neon is stable for 
the same reason: Its outermost orbit (n = 2) has eight electrons (the maximum 
allowed), so neon is an inert gas. 
In contrast to neon, fluorine has one fewer electron in its outer shell (n = 2) than 
the maximum allowed and is readily attracted to other elements that might share an

electron to make a more stable set. The sodium atom seems divinely made for the 
situation, with one electron in its outermost orbit. It reacts strongly with fluorine to 
form the compound sodium fluoride, as pictured in Figure 2.3. 
At the low atomic numbers considered here, the prediction of the number of 
electrons in the outer orbit is straightforward. As the atomic number increases to 
higher levels, the allocation of electrons to the different orbits becomes somewhat 
more complicated. There are rules and guidelines, based on quantum mechanics, 
that can be used to predict the positions of the electrons among the various orbits 
and explain their characteristics. A discussion of these rules is somewhat beyond the scope 
of this coverage of manufacturing materials. 
 
Bonding between Atoms and Molecules 
Atoms are held together in molecules by various types of bonds that depend on the 
valence electrons. By comparison, molecules are attracted to each other by weaker 
bonds, which generally result from the electron configuration in the indi- vidual 
molecules. Thus, we have two types of bonding: (1) primary bonds, gener- ally 
associated with the formation of molecules; and (2) secondary bonds, generally associated 
with attraction between molecules. Primary bonds are much stronger than 
secondary bonds. 
 
Primary Bonds Primary bonds are characterized by strong atom-to-atom attrac- 
tions that involve the exchange of valence electrons. Primary bonds include the fol- 
lowing forms: (a) ionic, (b) covalent, and (c) metallic, as illustrated in Figure 2.4. 
Ionic and covalent bonds are called intramolecular bonds because they involve at- 
tractive forces between atoms within the molecule. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FIGURE 2.4 Three 
forms of primary bonding: 
(a) ionic, (b) covalent, 
and (c) metallic. 
2.2 
Section 2.2/Bonding between Atoms and Molecules 
40 
 
 
In the ionic bond, the atoms of one element give up their outer electron(s), which 
are in turn attracted to the atoms of some other element to increase their electron count 
in the outermost shell to eight. In general, eight electrons in the outer shell is the most 
stable atomic configuration (except for the very light atoms), and nature pro- vides a 
very strong bond between atoms that achieves this configuration. The previous example 
of the reaction of sodium and fluorine to form sodium fluoride (Figure 2.3) illustrates 
this form of atomic bond. Sodium chloride (table salt) is a more common example. 
Because of the transfer of electrons between the atoms, sodium and fluorine (or sodium 
and chlorine) ions are formed, from which this bonding derives its name. Properties of 
solid materials with ionic bonding include low electrical conductivity and poor 
ductility. 
The covalent bond is one in which electrons are shared (as opposed to trans- 
ferred) between atoms in their outermost shells to achieve a stable set of eight. 
Fluorine and diamond are two examples of covalent bonds. In fluorine, one electron 
from each of two atoms is shared to form F2 gas, as shown in Figure 2.5(a). In the 
case of diamond, which is carbon (atomic number 6), each atom has four neighbors 
with which it shares electrons. This produces a very rigid three-dimensional struc- 
ture, not adequately represented in Figure 2.5(b), and accounts for the extreme high 
hardness of this material. Other forms of carbon (e.g., graphite) do not exhibit this 
rigid atomic structure. Solids with covalent bonding generally possess high hardness 
and low electrical conductivity. 
The metallic bond is, of course, the atomic bonding mechanism in pure metals 
and metal alloys. Atoms of the metallic elements generally possess too few elec- 
trons in their outermost orbits to complete the outer shells for all of the atoms in, 
say, a given block of metal. Accordingly, instead of sharing on an atom-to-atom 
basis, metallic bonding involves the sharing of outer-shell electrons by all atoms 
to form a general electron cloud that permeates the entire block. This cloud pro- 
vides the attractive forces to hold the atoms together and form a strong, rigid 
structure in most cases. Because of the general sharing of electrons, and their 
freedom to move within the metal, metallic bonding provides for good electri- cal 
conductivity. Other typical properties of materials characterized by metallic 
bonding include good conduction of heat and good ductility. (Although some of 
these terms are yet to be defined, the reader’s general understanding of material 
properties is assumed.) 
 
Secondary Bonds Whereas primary bonds involve atom-to-atom attractive forces, 
secondary bonds involve attraction forces between molecules, or intermolecular forces. 
There is no transfer or sharing of electrons in secondary bonding, and these bonds are

FIGURE 2.6  Three types of secondary bonding: (a) dipole forces, (b) London forces, and (c) hydrogen bonding. 
 
 
therefore weaker than primary bonds. There are three forms of secondary bonding: 
(a) dipole forces, (b) London forces, and (c) hydrogen bonding, illustrated in Figure 2.6. 
Types (a) and (b) are often referred to as van der Waals forces, after the scientist who 
first studied and quantified them. 
Dipole forces arise in a molecule comprised of two atoms that have equal and 
opposite electrical charges. Each molecule therefore forms a dipole, as shown in 
Figure 2.6(a) for hydrogen chloride. Although the material is electrically neu- tral 
in its aggregate form, on a molecular scale the individual dipoles attract each 
other, given the proper orientation of positive and negative ends of the molecules. 
These dipole forces provide a net intermolecular bonding within the material. 
London forces involve attractive forces between nonpolar molecules; that is, the 
atoms in the molecule do not form dipoles in the sense of the preceding paragraph. 
However, owing to the rapid motion of the electrons in orbit around the molecule, 
temporary dipoles form when more electrons happen to be on one side of the mole- 
cule than the other, as suggested by Figure 2.6(b). These instantaneous dipoles pro- 
vide a force of attraction between molecules in the material. 
Finally, hydrogen bonding occurs in molecules containing hydrogen atoms that are 
covalently bonded to another atom (e.g., oxygen in H2O). Because the elec- trons 
needed to complete the shell of the hydrogen atom are aligned on one side of 
its nucleus, the opposite side has a net positive charge that attracts the electrons of 
atoms in neighboring molecules. Hydrogen bonding is illustrated in Figure 
2.6(c) for water, and is generally a stronger intermolecular bonding mechanism 
than the other two forms of secondary bonding. It is important in the formation of 
many polymers. 
 
Crystalline Structures 
Atoms and molecules are used as building blocks for the more macroscopic struc- ture 
of matter that is considered here and in the following section. When materials solidify 
from the molten state, they tend to close ranks and pack tightly, in many cases 
arranging themselves into a very orderly structure, and in other cases, not quite so 
orderly. Two fundamentally different material structures can be distin- guished: (1) 
crystalline and (2) noncrystalline. Crystalline structures are examined in this section, 
and noncrystalline in the next. 
Many materials form into crystals on solidification from the molten or liquid state. 
It is characteristic of virtually all metals, as well as many ceramics and polymers. A 
crystalline structure is one in which the atoms are located at regular and recurring 
positions in three dimensions. 
The pattern may be replicated millions of times within

a given crystal. The structure can be viewed in the form of a unit cell, which is the 
basic geometric grouping of atoms that is repeated. To illustrate, consider the unit 
cell for the body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure shown in Figure 2.7, one of 
the common structures found in metals. The simplest model of the BCC unit cell is 
illustrated in Figure 2.7(a). Although this model clearly depicts the locations of the 
atoms within the cell, it does not indicate the close packing of the atoms that occurs 
in the real crystal, as in Figure 2.7(b). Figure 2.7(c) shows the repeating nature of the unit 
cell within the crystal. 
 
 
2.3.1 TYPES OF CRYSTAL STRUCTURES 
 
In metals, three lattice structures are common: (1) body-centered cubic (BCC), 
(2) face-centered cubic (FCC), and (3) hexagonal close-packed (HCP), illustrated 
in Figure 2.8. Crystal structures for the common metals are presented in Table 2.1. 
It should be noted that some metals undergo a change of structure at different 
temperatures. Iron, for example, is BCC at room temperature; it changes to FCC 
above 912°C (1674°F) and back to BCC at temperatures above 1400°C (2550°F). 
When a metal (or other material) changes structure like this, it is referred to as 
being allotropic.

2.3.2 IMPERFECTIONS IN CRYSTALS 
 
Thus far, crystal structures have been discussed as if they were perfect—the unit cell 
repeated in the material over and over in all directions. A perfect crystal is sometimes 
desirable to satisfy aesthetic or engineering purposes. For instance, a perfect dia- mond 
(contains no flaws) is more valuable than one containing imperfections. In the 
production of integrated circuit chips, large single crystals of silicon possess desirable 
processing characteristics for forming the microscopic details of the circuit pattern. 
However, there are various reasons why a crystal’s lattice structure may not 
be perfect. The imperfections often arise naturally because of the inability of the 
solidifying material to continue the replication of the unit cell indefinitely without 
interruption. Grain boundaries in metals are an example. In other cases, the imper- 
fections are introduced purposely during the manufacturing process, for example, 
the addition of an alloying ingredient in a metal to increase its strength. 
The various imperfections in crystalline solids are also called defects. Either term, 
imperfection or defect, refers to deviations in the regular pattern of the crystalline 
lattice structure. They can be catalogued as (1) point defects, (2) line defects, and 
(3) surface defects. 
Point defects are imperfections in the crystal structure involving either a single 
atom or a few atoms. The defects can take various forms including, as shown in 
Figure 2.9: (a) vacancy, the simplest defect, involving a missing atom within the 
lattice structure; (b) ion-pair vacancy, also called a Schottky defect, which involves

a missing pair of ions of opposite charge in a compound that has an overall charge 
balance; (c) interstitialcy, a lattice distortion produced by the presence of an extra 
atom in the structure; and (d) displaced ion, known as a Frenkel defect, which oc- 
curs when an ion becomes removed from a regular position in the lattice structure 
and inserted into an interstitial position not normally occupied by such an ion. 
A line defect is a connected group of point defects that forms a line in the lat- 
tice structure. The most important line defect is the dislocation, which can take two 
forms: (a) edge dislocation and (b) screw dislocation. An edge dislocation is the edge 
of an extra plane of atoms that exists in the lattice, as illustrated in Figure 2.10(a). 
A screw dislocation, Figure 2.10(b), is a spiral within the lattice structure wrapped 
around an imperfection line, like a screw is wrapped around its axis. Both types of 
dislocations can arise in the crystal structure during solidification (e.g., casting), or 
they can be initiated during a deformation process (e.g., metal forming) performed 
on the solid material. Dislocations are useful in explaining certain aspects of me- 
chanical behavior in metals. 
Surface defects are imperfections that extend in two directions to form a boundary. The 
most obvious example is the external surface of a crystalline object that defines its 
shape. The surface is an interruption in the lattice structure. Surface boundaries can 
also lie inside the material. Grain boundaries are the best example of these in- ternal 
surface interruptions. Metallic grains are discussed in a moment, but first let 
consider how deformation occurs in a crystal lattice, and how the process is aided by 
the presence of dislocations. 
 
 
2.3.3 DEFORMATION IN METALLIC CRYSTALS 
 
When a crystal is subjected to a gradually increasing mechanical stress, its initial 
response is to deform elastically. This can be likened to a tilting of the lattice struc- 
ture without any changes of position among the atoms in the lattice, in the manner 
depicted in Figure 2.11(a) and (b). If the force is removed, the lattice structure (and 
therefore the crystal) returns to its original shape. If the stress reaches a high value 
relative to the electrostatic forces holding the atoms in their lattice positions, a per- 
manent shape change occurs, called plastic deformation. What has happened is that 
the atoms in the lattice have permanently moved from their previous locations, and 
a new equilibrium lattice has been formed, as suggested by Figure 2.11(c). 
Section 2.3/Crystalline Structures 
45 
 
 
 
 
FIGURE 2.11 Deformation of a crystal structure: (a) original lattice; (b) elastic deformation, 
with no permanent change in positions of atoms; and (c) plastic deformation, in which atoms 
in the lattice are forced to move to new “homes.” 
 
The lattice deformation shown in (c) of the figure is one possible mechanism, called 
slip, by which plastic deformation can occur in a crystalline structure. The other is 
called twinning, discussed later. 
Slip involves the relative movement of atoms on opposite sides of a plane in the 
lattice, called the slip plane. The slip plane must be somehow aligned with the lattice 
structure (as indicated in the sketch), and so there are certain preferred directions 
along which slip is more likely to occur. The number of these slip directions de- 
pends on the lattice type. The three common metal crystal structures are somewhat 
more complicated, especially in three dimensions, than the square lattice depicted in Figure 
2.11. It turns out that HCP has the fewest slip directions, BCC the most, and FCC 
falls in between. HCP metals show poor ductility and are generally difficult to 
deform at room temperature. Metals with BCC structure would figure to have the 
highest ductility, if the number of slip directions were the only criterion. However, 
nature is not so simple. These metals are generally stronger than the others, which 
complicates the issue, and the BCC metals usually require higher stresses to cause 
slip. In fact, some of the BCC metals exhibit poor ductility. Low carbon steel is a 
notable exception; although relatively strong, it is widely used with great commer- 
cial success in sheet-metal-forming operations, where it exhibits good ductility. The 
FCC metals are generally the most ductile of the three crystal structures, combining 
a good number of slip directions with (usually) relatively low to moderate strength. 
All three of these metal structures become more ductile at elevated temperatures, 
and this fact is often exploited in shaping them. 
Dislocations play an important role in facilitating slip in metals. When a lattice 
structure containing an edge dislocation is subjected to a shear stress, the material 
deforms much more readily than in a perfect structure. This is explained by the fact 
that the dislocation is put into motion within the crystal lattice in the presence of the 
stress, as shown in the series of sketches in Figure 2.12. Why is it easier to move a dis- 
location through the lattice than it is to deform the lattice itself? The answer is that 
the atoms at the edge dislocation require a smaller displacement within the distorted lattice 
structure to reach a new equilibrium position. Thus, a lower energy level is needed 
to realign the atoms into the new positions than if the lattice were missing the 
dislocation. A lower stress level is therefore required to effect the deformation. 
Because the new position manifests a similar distorted lattice, movement of atoms 
at the dislocation continues at the lower stress level. 
The slip phenomenon and the influence of dislocations have been explained here 
on a very microscopic basis. On a larger scale, slip occurs many times over 
Section 2.3/Crystalline Structures

FIGURE 2.12  Effect of dislocations in the lattice structure under stress. In the series of diagrams, the 
movement of the dislocation allows deformation to occur under a lower stress than in a perfect lattice. 
 
 
throughout the metal when subjected to a deforming load, thus causing it to ex- 
hibit the familiar macroscopic behavior of stretching, compressing, or bending. 
Dislocations represent a good-news–bad-news situation. Because of dislocations, 
the metal is more ductile and yields more readily to plastic deformation (forming) 
during manufacturing. However, from a product design viewpoint, the metal is not 
nearly as strong as it would be in the absence of dislocations. 
Twinning is a second way in which metal crystals plastically deform. Twinning 
can be defined as a mechanism of plastic deformation in which atoms on one side of 
a plane (called the twinning plane) are shifted to form a mirror image of the other 
side of the plane. It is illustrated in Figure 2.13. The mechanism is important in HCP metals 
(e.g., magnesium, zinc) because they do not slip readily. Besides structure, another 
factor in twinning is the rate of deformation. The slip mechanism requires more 
time than twinning, which can occur almost instantaneously. Thus, when the 
deformation rate is very high, metals twin that would otherwise slip. Low carbon 
steel is an example that illustrates this rate sensitivity; when subjected to high strain 
rates it twins, whereas at moderate rates it deforms by slip.

Each grain has its own unique lattice orientation; but collectively, the grains are ran- 
domly oriented within the block. Such a structure is referred to as polycrystalline. It 
is easy to understand how such a structure is the natural state of the material. When 
the block is cooled from the molten state and begins to solidify, nucleation of indi- 
vidual crystals occurs at random positions and orientations throughout the liquid. 
As 
these crystals grow they finally interfere with each other, forming at their interface a 
surface defect—a grain boundary. The grain boundary consists of a transition zone, 
perhaps only a few atoms thick, in which the atoms are not aligned with either grain. 
The size of the grains in the metal block is determined by the number of nucleation 
sites in the molten material and the cooling rate of the mass, among other factors. In 
a casting process, the nucleation sites are often created by the relatively cold walls 
of the mold, which motivates a somewhat preferred grain orientation at these walls. 
Grain size is inversely related to cooling rate: Faster cooling promotes smaller 
grain size, whereas slower cooling has the opposite effect. Grain size is important 
in metals because it affects mechanical properties. Smaller grain size is generally 
preferable from a design viewpoint because it means higher strength and hard- 
ness. It is also desirable in certain manufacturing operations (e.g., metal forming), 
because it means higher ductility during deformation and a better surface on the 
finished product. 
Another factor influencing mechanical properties is the presence of grain 
boundaries in the metal. They represent imperfections in the crystalline structure 
that interrupt the continued movement of dislocations. This helps to explain why 
smaller grain size—therefore more grains and more grain boundaries—increases the 
strength of the metal. By interfering with dislocation movement, grain boundaries 
also contribute to the characteristic property of a metal to become stronger as it is 
deformed. The property is called strain hardening, and it is examined more closely 
in Chapter 3 on mechanical properties. 
 
Noncrystalline (Amorphous) Structures 
Many important materials are noncrystalline—liquids and gases, for example. Water 
and air have noncrystalline structures. A metal loses its crystalline structure when 
it is melted. Mercury is a liquid metal at room temperature, with its melting point 
of -38°C (-37°F). Important classes of engineering materials have a noncrystalline 
form in their solid state; the term amorphous is often used to describe these materi- 
als. Glass, many plastics, and rubber fall into this category. Many important plastics 
are mixtures of crystalline and noncrystalline forms. Even metals can be amorphous rather 
than crystalline, given that the cooling rate during transformation from liquid to solid 
is fast enough to inhibit the atoms from arranging themselves into their pre- ferred 
regular patterns. This can happen, for instance, if the molten metal is poured 
between cold, closely spaced, rotating rolls. 
Two closely related features distinguish noncrystalline from crystalline materials: 
(1) absence of a long-range order in the molecular structure, and (2) differences in 
melting and thermal expansion characteristics. 
The difference in molecular structure can be visualized with reference to Fig- 
ure 2.14. The closely packed and repeating pattern of the crystal structure is shown 
on the left; and the less dense and random arrangement of atoms in the noncrystalline

material on the right. The difference is demonstrated by a metal when it melts. The 
more loosely packed atoms in the molten metal show an increase in volume (reduction 
in density) compared with the material’s solid crystalline state. This effect is character- 
istic of most materials when melted (ice is a notable exception; liquid water is denser 
than solid ice). It is a general characteristic of liquids and solid amorphous materials 
that they are absent of long-range order as on the right in our figure. 
The melting phenomenon will now be examined in more detail, and in doing so, 
the second important difference between crystalline and noncrystalline structures is 
illustrated. As indicated above, a metal experiences an increase in volume when it 
melts from the solid to the liquid state. For a pure metal, this volumetric change occurs 
rather abruptly, at a constant temperature (i.e., the melting temperature Tm), as indi- 
cated in Figure 2.15. The change represents a discontinuity from the slopes on either 
side in the plot. The gradual slopes characterize the metal’s thermal expansion—the 
change in volume as a function of temperature, which is usually different in the solid 
and liquid states. Associated with the sudden volume increase as the metal transforms from 
solid to liquid at the melting point is the addition of a certain quantity of heat, called 
the heat of fusion, which causes the atoms to lose the dense, regular arrange- ment 
of the crystalline structure. The process is reversible; it operates in both direc- tions. 
If the molten metal is cooled through its melting temperature, the same abrupt change 
in volume occurs (except that it is a decrease), and the same quantity of heat is given 
off by the metal. 
An amorphous material exhibits quite different behavior than that of a pure 
metal when it changes from solid to liquid, as shown in Figure 2.15. The process 
is again reversible, but observe the behavior of the amorphous material during

cooling from the liquid state, rather than during melting from the solid, as before. 
Glass (silica, SiO2) is used to illustrate. At high temperatures, glass is a true liquid, 
and the molecules are free to move about as in the usual definition of a liquid. As 
the glass cools, it gradually transforms into the solid state, going through a transi- 
tion phase, called a supercooled liquid, before finally becoming rigid. It does not 
show the sudden volumetric change that is characteristic of crystalline materials; 
instead it passes through its melting temperature Tm without a change in its thermal 
expansion slope. In this supercooled liquid region, the material becomes increas- 
ingly viscous as the temperature continues to decrease. As it cools further, a point 
is finally reached at which the supercooled liquid converts to a solid. This is called 
the glass-transition temperature Tg. At this point, there is a change in the thermal 
expansion slope. (It might be more precise to refer to it as the thermal contraction 
slope; however, the slope is the same for expansion and contraction). The rate of 
thermal expansion is lower for the solid material than for the supercooled liquid. 
The difference in behavior between crystalline and noncrystalline materials can 
be traced to the response of their respective atomic structures to changes in temper- 
ature. When a pure metal solidifies from the molten state, the atoms arrange them- 
selves into a regular and recurring structure. This crystal structure is much more 
compact than the random and loosely packed liquid from which it formed. Thus, 
the process of solidification produces the abrupt volumetric contraction observed 
in Figure 2.15 for the crystalline material. By contrast, amorphous materials do not 
achieve this repeating and closely packed structure at low temperatures. The atomic 
structure is the same random arrangement as in the liquid state; thus, there is no 
abrupt volumetric change as these materials transition from liquid to solid. 
 
Engineering Materials 
This section summarizes how atomic structure, bonding, and crystal structure (or 
absence thereof) are related to the type of engineering material: metals, ceramics, 
and polymers. 
 
Metals Metals have crystalline structures in the solid state, almost without excep- 
tion. The unit cells of these crystal structures are almost always BCC, FCC, or HCP. 
The atoms of the metals are held together by metallic bonding, which means that 
their valence electrons can move about with relative freedom (compared with the 
other types of atomic and molecular bonding). These structures and bonding gener- 
ally make the metals strong and hard. Many of the metals are quite ductile (capable of being 
deformed, which is useful in manufacturing), especially the FCC metals. Other general 
properties of metals related to structure and bonding include high electri- cal and 
thermal conductivity, opaqueness (impervious to light rays), and reflectivity 
(capacity to reflect light rays). 
 
Ceramics Ceramic molecules are characterized by ionic or covalent bonding, or 
both. The metallic atoms release or share their outermost electrons to the nonme- 
tallic atoms, and a strong attractive force exists within the molecules. The general 
properties that result from these bonding mechanisms include high hardness and 
stiffness (even at elevated temperatures) and brittleness (no ductility). The bond- 
ing also means that ceramics are electrically insulating (nonconducting), refractory 
(thermally resistant), and chemically inert.

Ceramics possess either a crystalline or noncrystalline 
structure. Most ceramics have a crystal structure, whereas glasses 
based on silica (SiO2) are amorphous. In certain cases, either 
structure can exist in the same ceramic material. For example, 
silica occurs in nature as crystalline quartz. When this mineral is 
melted and then cooled, it solidifies to form fused silica, which 
has a noncrystalline structure. 
 
Polymers A polymer molecule consists of many repeating 
mers to form very large molecules held together by covalent 
bonding. Elements in polymers are usu- ally carbon plus one or 
more other elements such as hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and 
chlorine. Secondary bonding (van der Waals) holds the 
molecules 
together 
within 
the 
aggregate 
material 
(intermolecular bonding). Polymers have either a glassy 
structure or mixture of glassy and crystalline. There are 
differences among the three polymer types. In thermoplastic 
polymers, the molecules consist of long chains of mers in a 
linear structure. These materials can be heated and cooled 
without substantially altering their linear structure. In 
thermosetting polymers, the molecules transform into a rigid, 
three-dimensional structure on cooling from a heated plastic 
condition. If thermosetting polymers are reheated, they 
degrade chemically rather than soften. Elastomers have large 
molecules with coiled struc- tures. The uncoiling and recoiling 
of the molecules when subjected to stress cycles motivate the 
aggregate material to exhibit its characteristic elastic behavior. 
The molecular structure and bonding of polymers provide them 
with the fol- lowing typical properties: low density, high 
electrical resistivity (some polymers are used as insulating 
materials), and low thermal conductivity. Strength and stiff- ness 
of polymers vary widely. Some are strong and rigid (although 
not matching the strength and stiffness of metals or ceramics), 
whereas others exhibit highly elastic behavior.

### First Formula in Section 4.4 Electrical Properties

The first formula in Section 4.4 on Electrical Properties is related to the resistivity of materials. The section discusses how resistivity and conductivity are fundamental electrical properties that influence the behavior of materials in various applications, particularly in microelectronics and manufacturing processes [Data: Sources (0)].

The formula for resistivity (œÅ) is typically given by:

\[ \rho = R \cdot \frac{A}{L} \]

where:
- \( \rho \) is the resistivity of the material,
- \( R \) is the resistance,
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area,
- \( L \) is the length of the material.

This formula helps in understanding how different materials respond to electrical forces, which is crucial for designing efficient and reliable electronic components [Data: Sources (0)].

Physical properties, as the term is used here, defines 
the behavior of materials in response to physical forces 
other than mechanical. They include volumetric, ther- 
mal, electrical, and electrochemical properties. Compo- 
nents in a product must do more than simply withstand 
mechanical stresses. They must conduct electricity (or 
prevent its conduction), allow heat to be transferred (or 
allow it to escape), transmit light (or block its transmis- 
sion), and satisfy myriad other functions. 
Physical properties are important in manufacturing 
because they often influence the performance of the 
process. For example, thermal properties of the work 
material in machining determine the cutting tempera- 
ture, which affects how long the tool can be used be- 
fore it fails. In microelectronics, electrical properties 
of silicon and the way in which these properties can be 
altered by various chemical and physical processes com- 
prise the basis of semiconductor manufacturing. 
This chapter covers the physical properties that are 
most important in manufacturing—properties that are 
encountered in subsequent chapters of the book. They 
are divided into major categories such as volumetric, 
thermal, electrical, and so on. Also, as in the previous 
chapter on mechanical properties, the importance of 
these properties in manufacturing is discussed. 
 
4.1 Volumetric and 
Melting Properties 
These properties are related to the volume of solids and 
how they are affected by temperature. The prop- erties 
include density, thermal expansion, and melting point. 
They are explained in the following, and typical values 
for selected engineering materials are presented in

4.1.1 DENSITY 
 
In engineering, the density of a material is its weight per unit volume. Its symbol is 
r, and typical units are g/cm3 (lb/in3). The density of an element is determined by 
its atomic number and other factors such as atomic radius and atomic packing. The 
term specific gravity expresses the density of a material relative to the density of 
water and is therefore a ratio with no units. 
Density is an important consideration in the selection of a material for a given 
application, but it is generally not the only property of interest. Strength is also 
important, and the two properties are often related in a strength-to-weight ratio, 
which is the tensile strength of the material divided by its density. The ratio is useful 
in comparing materials for structural applications in aircraft, automobiles, and other 
products in which weight and energy are of concern. 
 
4.1.2 THERMAL EXPANSION 
 
The density of a material is a function of temperature. The general relationship is 
that density decreases with increasing temperature. Put another way, the volume per 
Section 4.1/Volumetric and Melting Properties 
85 
 
 
unit weight increases with temperature. Thermal expansion is the name given to this effect 
that temperature has on density. It is usually expressed as the coefficient of thermal 
expansion, which measures the change in length per degree of temperature, as 
mm/mm/°C (in/in/°F). It is a length ratio rather than a volume ratio because this is easier 
to measure and apply. It is consistent with the usual design situation in which 
dimensional changes are of greater interest than volumetric changes. The change in 
length corresponding to a given temperature change is given by: 
 
L2 - 
L1 = aL1 (T2 - 
T1) 
(4.1) 
 
where a = coefficient of thermal expansion, °C-1(°F-1); and L1 and L2 are lengths, 
mm (in), corresponding, respectively, to temperatures T1 and T2, °C (°F). 
Values of coefficient of thermal expansion given in Table 4.1 suggest that it has 
a linear relationship with temperature. This is only an approximation. Not only is 
length affected by temperature, but the thermal expansion coefficient itself is also 
affected. For some materials it increases with temperature; for other materials it 
decreases. These changes are usually not significant enough to be of much concern, 
and values like those in the table are quite useful in design calculations for the range 
of temperatures contemplated in service. Changes in the coefficient are more sub- 
stantial when the metal undergoes a phase transformation, such as from solid to 
liquid, or from one crystal structure to another. 
In manufacturing operations, thermal expansion is put to good use in shrink fit 
and expansion fit assemblies (Section 31.3), in which a part is heated to increase its 
size or cooled to decrease its size to permit insertion into some other part. When the 
part returns to ambient temperature, a tightly fitted assembly is obtained. Thermal 
expansion can be a problem in heat treatment (Chapter 26) and welding (Section 
29.6) because of thermal stresses that develop in the material during these processes. 
 
 
4.1.3 MELTING CHARACTERISTICS 
 
For a pure element, the melting point Tm is the temperature at which the mate- rial 
transforms from solid to liquid state. The reverse transformation, from liquid to solid, 
occurs at the same temperature and is called the freezing point. For crystalline elements, 
such as metals, the melting and freezing temperatures are the same. A cer- tain 
amount of heat energy, called the heat of fusion, is required at this temperature to 
accomplish the transformation from solid to liquid. 
Melting of a metal element at a specific temperature assumes equilibrium condi- 
tions. Exceptions occur in nature; for example, when a molten metal is cooled, it may 
remain in the liquid state below its freezing point if nucleation of crystals does not 
initiate immediately. When this happens, the liquid is said to be supercooled. 
There are other variations in the melting process—differences in the way melt- 
ing occurs in different materials. For example, unlike pure metals, most metal alloys 
do not have a single melting point. Instead, melting begins at a certain temperature, 
the temperature increases until finally convert- 
ing completely to the liquid state at a temperature called the liquidus. Between the 
two temperatures, the alloy is a mixture of solid and molten metals, the amounts of 
each being inversely proportional to their relative distances from the liquidus and 
solidus. Although most alloys behave in this way, exceptions are eutectic alloys that 
 
 
called the solidus, and continues as

melt (and freeze) at a single temperature. These issues are examined in the discus- 
sion of phase diagrams in Chapter 6. 
Another difference in melting occurs with noncrystalline materials (glasses). In 
these materials, there is a gradual transition from solid to liquid states. The solid 
material gradually softens as temperature increases, finally becoming liquid at the 
melting point. During softening, the material has a consistency of increasing plasticity 
(increasingly like a fluid) as it gets closer to the melting point. 
These differences in melting characteristics among pure metals, alloys, and glass 
are portrayed in Figure 4.1. The plots show changes in density as a function of tem- 
perature for three hypothetical materials: a pure metal, an alloy, and glass. Plotted in 
the figure is the volumetric change, which is the reciprocal of density. 
The importance of melting in manufacturing is obvious. In metal casting 
(Chapters 10 and 11), the metal is melted and then poured into a mold cavity. Metals with 
lower melting points are generally easier to cast, but if the melting temperature is too 
low, the metal loses its applicability as an engineering material. Melting char- 
acteristics of polymers are important in plastic molding and other polymer shaping 
processes (Chapter 13). Sintering of powdered metals and ceramics requires knowl- 
edge of melting points. Sintering does not melt the materials, but the temperatures 
used in the process must approach the melting point to achieve the required bond- 
ing of the powders (Chapters 15 and 16). 
 
Thermal Properties 
Much of the previous section is concerned with the effects of temperature on volu- 
metric properties of materials. Certainly, thermal expansion, melting, and heat of 
fusion are thermal properties because temperature determines the thermal energy 
level of the atoms, leading to the changes in the materials. The current section ex- 
amines several additional thermal properties—ones that relate to the storage and 
flow of heat within a substance. The usual properties of interest are specific heat

4.2. 
 
 
4.2.1 SPECIFIC HEAT AND THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY 
 
The specific heat C of a material is defined as the quantity of heat energy required to 
increase the temperature of a unit mass of the material by one degree. Some typical 
values are listed in Table 4.2. To determine the amount of energy needed to heat a 
certain weight of a metal in a furnace to a given elevated temperature, the following 
equation can be used: 
 
H = C W (T2 - 
T1) 
(4.2) 
 
where H = amount of heat energy, J (Btu); C = specific heat of the material, J/kg °C 
(Btu/lb °F); W = its weight, kg (lb); and (T2 - T1) = change in temperature, °C (°F). 
The volumetric heat storage capacity of a material is often of interest. This is sim- 
ply density multiplied by specific heat rC. Thus, volumetric specific heat is the heat 
energy required to raise the temperature of a unit volume of material by one degree, 
J/mm3 °C (Btu/in3 °F). 
Conduction is a fundamental heat-transfer process. It involves transfer of thermal 
energy within a material from molecule to molecule by purely thermal motions; no 
transfer of mass occurs. The thermal conductivity of a substance is therefore its capa- bility 
to transfer heat through itself by this physical mechanism. It is measured by the 
coefficient of thermal conductivity k, which has typical units of J/s mm °C (Btu/ in hr 
°F). The coefficient of thermal conductivity is generally high in metals, low in 
ceramics and plastics. 
Section 4.2/Thermal Properties 
87 
 
 
The ratio of thermal conductivity to volumetric specific heat is frequently encoun- 
tered in heat transfer analysis. It is called the thermal diffusivity K and is determined as 
 
K =  k  
rC 
(4.3) 
Thermal diffusivity is used to calculate cutting temperatures in machining (Section 
20.5.1). 
 
 
4.2.2 THERMAL PROPERTIES IN MANUFACTURING 
 
Thermal properties play an important role in manufacturing because heat genera- 
tion is common in so many processes. In some operations heat is the energy that ac- 
complishes the process; in others heat is generated as a consequence of the process. 
Specific heat is of interest for several reasons. In processes that require heating of 
the material (e.g., casting, heat treating, and hot metal forming), specific heat deter- 
mines the amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature to a desired level, 
according to Equation (4.2). 
In many processes carried out at ambient temperature, the mechanical energy to 
perform the operation is converted to heat, which raises the temperature of the work 
part. This is common in machining and cold forming of metals. The temperature rise is 
a function of the metal’s specific heat. Coolants are often used in machining to reduce these 
temperatures, and here the fluid’s heat capacity is critical. Water is almost always 
employed as the base for these fluids because of its high heat-carrying capacity. 
Thermal conductivity functions to dissipate heat in manufacturing processes, 
sometimes beneficially, sometimes not. In mechanical processes such as metal form- 
ing and machining, much of the power required to operate the process is converted 
to heat. The ability of the work material and tooling to conduct heat away from its 
source is highly desirable in these processes. 
On the other hand, high thermal conductivity of the work metal is undesirable 
in fusion welding processes such as arc welding. In these operations, the heat input 
must be concentrated at the joint location so that the metal can be melted. For exam- 
ple, copper is generally difficult to weld because its high thermal conductivity allows heat 
to be conducted from the energy source into the work too rapidly, inhibiting heat 
buildup for melting at the joint. 
 
Mass Diffusion 
In addition to heat transfer in a material, there is also mass transfer. Mass diffusion 
involves movement of atoms or molecules within a material or across a boundary 
between two materials in contact. It is perhaps more appealing to one’s intuition that 
such a phenomenon occurs in liquids and gases, but it also occurs in solids. It occurs 
in pure metals, in alloys, and between materials that share a common interface. Be- 
cause of thermal agitation of the atoms in a material (solid, liquid, or gas), atoms are 
continuously moving about. In liquids and gases, where the level of thermal agitation 
is high, it is a free-roaming movement. In solids (metals in particular), the atomic 
motion is facilitated by vacancies and other imperfections in the crystal structure. 
Diffusion can be illustrated by the series of sketches in Figure 4.2 for the case of 
two metals suddenly brought into intimate contact with each other. At the start, both

brought together, they each have their individual compositions; (2) after some time, an exchange of atoms has 
occurred; and (3) eventually, a condition of uniform concentration occurs. The concentration gradient dc/dx for 
metal A is plotted in (b) of the figure. 
 
 
metals have their own atomic structure; but with time there is an exchange of atoms, 
not only across the boundary, but within the separate pieces. Given enough time, the 
assembly of two pieces will finally reach a uniform composition throughout. 
Temperature is an important factor in diffusion. At higher temperatures, thermal 
agitation is greater and the atoms can move about more freely. Another factor is the 
concentration gradient dc/dx, which indicates the concentration of the two types of 
atoms in a direction of interest defined by x. The concentration gradient is plotted in 
Figure 4.2(b) to correspond to the instantaneous distribution of atoms in the assembly. The 
relationship often used to describe mass diffusion is Fick’s first law: 
dm = -D ( 
dc ) A dt 
(4.4) 
where dm = small amount of material transferred, D = diffusion coefficient of the 
metal, which increases rapidly with temperature, dc/dx = concentration gradient, A 
= area of the boundary, and dt represents a small time increment. An alternative 
expression of Equation (4.4) gives the mass diffusion rate: 
dm = -D ( 
dc )

Although these equations are difficult to use in calculations because of the prob- 
lem of assessing D, they are helpful in understanding diffusion and the variables on 
which D depends. 
Mass diffusion is used in several processes. A number of surface-hardening treat- ments 
are based on diffusion (Section 26.4), including carburizing and nitriding. Among 
the welding processes, diffusion welding (Section 29.5.2) is used to join two components 
by pressing them together and allowing diffusion to occur across the boundary to 
create a permanent bond. Diffusion is also used in electronics manufac- turing to alter the 
surface chemistry of a semiconductor chip in microscopic local- ized regions to 
create circuit details (Section 33.4.3). 
 
Electrical Properties 
Engineering materials exhibit a great variation in their capacity to conduct electric- 
ity. This section defines the physical properties by which this capacity is measured. 
 
4.4.1 RESISTIVITY AND CONDUCTIVITY 
 
The flow of electrical current involves movement of charge carriers—infinitesimally 
small particles possessing an electrical charge. In solids, these charge carriers are elec- 
trons. In a liquid solution, charge carriers are positive and negative ions. The move- 
ment of charge carriers is driven by the presence of an electric voltage and resisted by 
the inherent characteristics of the material, such as atomic structure and bonding 
between atoms and molecules. This is the familiar relationship defined by Ohm’s law: 
I = E 
R 
(4.6) 
where I = current, A; E = voltage, V; and R = electrical resistance, !1. The resistance 
in a uniform section of material (e.g., a wire) depends on its length L, cross-sectional area 
A, and the resistivity of the material r; thus, 
R = r  
L 
A 
or 
r = R A 
(4.7) 
where resistivity has units of !1-m2/m or !1-m (!1-in). Resistivity is the basic property 
that defines a material’s capability to resist current flow. Table 4.3 lists values of re- 
sistivity for selected materials. Resistivity is not a constant; instead it varies, as do so 
many other properties, with temperature. For metals, it increases with temperature. 
It is often more convenient to consider a material as conducting electrical current 
rather than resisting its flow. The conductivity of a material is simply the reciprocal 
of resistivity: 
Electrical conductivity = 1 
(4.8) 
where conductivity has units of (!1-m)-1 ((!1-in)-1). 
 
4.4.2 CLASSES OF MATERIALS BY ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES 
 
Metals are the best conductors of electricity, because of their metallic bonding. They 
have the lowest resistivity (Table 4.3). Most ceramics and polymers, whose electrons 
are tightly bound by covalent and/or ionic bonding, are poor conductors. Many of these 
materials are used as insulators because they possess high resistivities.

An insulator is sometimes referred to as a dielectric, because the term dielectric 
means nonconductor of direct current. It is a material that can be placed between 
two electrodes without conducting current between them. However, if the voltage is 
high enough, the current will suddenly pass through the material, for example, in the form 
of an arc. The dielectric strength of an insulating material, then, is the electrical potential 
required to break down the insulator per unit thickness. Appropriate units are 
volts/m (volts/in). 
In addition to conductors and insulators (or dielectrics), there are also supercon- 
ductors and semiconductors. A superconductor is a material that exhibits zero resis- 
tivity. It is a phenomenon that has been observed in certain materials at low tempera- 
tures approaching absolute zero. We might expect the existence of this phenomenon, 
due to the significant effect that temperature has on resistivity. That these supercon- 
ducting materials exist is of great scientific interest. If materials could be developed 
that exhibit this property at more normal temperatures, there would be significant 
practical implications in power transmission, electronic switching speeds, and mag- 
netic field applications. 
Semiconductors have already proven their practical worth. Their applications 
range from mainframe computers to household appliances and automotive engine 
controllers. As one would guess, a semiconductor is a material whose resistivity 
lies between insulators and conductors. The typical range is shown in Table 4.3. 
The most commonly used semiconductor material today is silicon (Section 7.5.2), 
largely because of its abundance in nature, relative low cost, and ease of processing. 
What makes semiconductors unique is the capacity to significantly alter conductivi- 
ties in their surface chemistries in microscopic areas to fabricate integrated circuits 
(Chapter 33). 
Electrical properties play an important role in various manufacturing processes. 
Some of the nontraditional processes use electrical energy to remove material. 
Electric discharge machining (Section 25.3.1) uses the heat generated by electrical 
energy in the form of sparks to remove material from metals. Most of the important

welding processes use electrical energy to melt the joint metal. Finally, the capacity 
to alter electrical properties of semiconductor materials is the basis for microelec- 
tronics manufacturing. 
 
Electrochemical Processes 
Electrochemistry is a field of science concerned with the relationship between electric- 
ity and chemical changes, and with the conversion of electrical and chemical energy. 
In a water solution, the molecules of an acid, base, or salt are dissociated into 
positively and negatively charged ions. These ions are the charge carriers in the 
solution—they allow electric current to be conducted, playing the same role that 
electrons play in metallic conduction. The ionized solution is called an electrolyte; 
and electrolytic conduction requires that current enter and leave the solution at 
electrodes. The positive electrode is called the anode, and the negative electrode is 
the cathode. The whole arrangement is called an electrolytic cell. At each electrode, 
some chemical reaction occurs, such as the deposition or dissolution of material, or 
the decomposition of gas from the solution. Electrolysis is the name given to these 
chemical changes occurring in the solution. 
Consider a specific case of electrolysis: decomposition of water, illustrated in 
Figure 4.3. To accelerate the process, dilute sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is used as the elec- 
trolyte, and platinum and carbon (both chemically inert) are used as electrodes. The 
electrolyte dissociates in the ions H+ and SO =. The H+ ions are attracted to the 
negatively charged cathode; upon reaching it they acquire an electron and combine 
into molecules of hydrogen gas: 
 
2H+ + 2e → H2 (gas) 
(4.9a) 
 
The SO = ions are attracted to the anode, transferring electrons to it to form addi- 
tional sulfuric acid and liberate oxygen: 
 
2SO = - 
4e + 2H O → 2H SO + O (gas) 
(4.9b) 
 
The product H2SO4 is dissociated into ions of H+ and SO = again and so the process 
continues.

In addition to the production of hydrogen and oxygen gases, 
as illustrated by the example, electrolysis is also used in several 
other industrial processes. Two examples are (1) electroplating 
(Section 27.3.1), an operation that adds a thin coating of one 
metal (e.g., chromium) to the surface of a second metal (e.g., 
steel) for decorative or other purposes; and (2) electrochemical 
machining (Section 25.2), a process in which material is 
removed from the surface of a metal part. Both these operations 
rely on electrolysis to either add or remove material from the 
surface of a metal part. In elec- troplating, the work part is set up 
in the electrolytic circuit as the cathode, so that the positive ions 
of the coating metal are attracted to the negatively charged part. 
In elec- trochemical machining, the work part is the anode, and a 
tool with the desired shape is the cathode. The action of 
electrolysis in this setup is to remove metal from the part surface 
in regions determined by the shape of the tool as it slowly feeds 
into the work. 
The two physical laws that determine the amount of material 
deposited or removed from a metallic surface were first stated by 
the British scientist Michael Faraday: 
 
1. The mass of a substance liberated in an electrolytic cell is 
proportional to the quantity of electricity passing through 
the cell. 
2. When the same quantity of electricity is passed through 
different electrolytic cells, the masses of the substances 
liberated are proportional to their chemical equivalents.

{"result": "Copper is a metal with a density of 8.97 g/cm\u00b3, a coefficient of thermal expansion of 17 x 10^-6 /\u00b0C, and a melting point of 1083\u00b0C. It has a resistivity of 1.7 x 10^-8 V-m (0.67 x 10^-6 V-in) and is renowned for its excellent electrical conductivity. Additionally, copper possesses high thermal conductivity, which makes it challenging to weld as it conducts heat away from the energy source too rapidly.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

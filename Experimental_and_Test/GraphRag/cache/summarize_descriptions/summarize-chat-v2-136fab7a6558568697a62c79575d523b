{"result": "FCC Metals refer to a category of metals with a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal structure. These metals are known for being the most ductile among the three primary crystal structures, combining a good number of slip directions with relatively low to moderate strength. Their high ductility makes them particularly useful in manufacturing applications.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

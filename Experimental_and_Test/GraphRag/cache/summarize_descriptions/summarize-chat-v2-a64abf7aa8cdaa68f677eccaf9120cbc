{"result": "Copper is a material that was discovered by early humans and could be hammered into shape, similar to gold. It is a metal with a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure at room temperature. Copper was likely the first metal to be extracted from ores, a process that required smelting. Unlike some other metals, copper could not be readily hammered because it strain hardened; instead, it was shaped by casting. Copper is classified as a noble metal and is found in column IB of the periodic table, sharing similar properties with silver and gold.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

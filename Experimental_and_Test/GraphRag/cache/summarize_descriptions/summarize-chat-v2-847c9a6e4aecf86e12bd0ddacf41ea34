{"result": "\"DIELECTRIC\" refers to a material, also known as an insulator, that can be placed between two electrodes without conducting current between them. It possesses a property called dielectric strength, which is the electrical potential required to break down the insulator per unit thickness. While a dielectric does not conduct direct current under normal conditions, it can conduct current if the voltage applied is high enough.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

{"result": "Hydrogen is a chemical element with the atomic number 1. It has one electron in its single orbit, which is the orbit closest to the nucleus. This electron configuration allows hydrogen to readily combine with other elements to form molecules such as H2 (molecular hydrogen) and H2O (water).", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

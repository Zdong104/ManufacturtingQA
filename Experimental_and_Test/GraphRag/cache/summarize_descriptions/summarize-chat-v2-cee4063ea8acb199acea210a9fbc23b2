{"result": "Iron is a metal that exhibits different crystal structures at different temperatures. At room temperature, iron has a body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure. When heated above 912\u00b0C (1674\u00b0F), iron changes to a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure. As the temperature continues to rise above 1400\u00b0C (2550\u00b0F), iron reverts back to a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

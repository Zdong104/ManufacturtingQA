{"result": "Metals are a fundamental category of engineering materials used extensively in manufacturing. They are typically found in the form of alloys, which are composed of two or more elements. In their solid state, metals almost always exist as crystals, characterized by their crystalline structures. Metals exhibit several key properties, including high strength, hardness, ductility, electrical and thermal conductivity, opaqueness, and reflectivity. These attributes are a result of metallic bonding, which is a defining feature of metals.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.

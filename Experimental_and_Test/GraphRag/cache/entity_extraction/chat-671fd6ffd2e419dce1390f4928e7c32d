The reverse transformation, from liquid to solid, \noccurs at the same temperature and is called the freezing point. For crystalline elements, \nsuch as metals, the melting and freezing temperatures are the same. A cer- tain \namount of heat energy, called the heat of fusion, is required at this temperature to \naccomplish the transformation from solid to liquid. \nMelting of a metal element at a specific temperature assumes equilibrium condi- \ntions. Exceptions occur in nature; for example, when a molten metal is cooled, it may \nremain in the liquid state below its freezing point if nucleation of crystals does not \ninitiate immediately. When this happens, the liquid is said to be supercooled. \nThere are other variations in the melting process\u2014differences in the way melt- \ning occurs in different materials. For example, unlike pure metals, most metal alloys \ndo not have a single melting point. Instead, melting begins at a certain temperature, \nthe temperature increases until finally convert- \ning completely to the liquid state at a temperature called the liquidus. Between the \ntwo temperatures, the alloy is a mixture of solid and molten metals, the amounts of \neach being inversely\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}

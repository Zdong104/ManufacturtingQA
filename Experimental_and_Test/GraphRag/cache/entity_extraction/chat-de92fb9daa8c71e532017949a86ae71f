In almost all cases, the alloys are more important commercially than the pure \nmetals. The nonferrous metals include the pure metals and alloys of aluminum, copper, \ngold, magnesium, nickel, silver, tin, titanium, zinc, and other metals. \n \n1.2.2 CERAMICS \n \nA ceramic is defined as a compound containing metallic (or semimetallic) and nonme- \ntallic elements. Typical nonmetallic elements are oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon. Ceram- \nics include a variety of traditional and modern materials. Traditional ceramics, some of \nwhich have been used for thousands of years, include: clay (abundantly available, con- \nsisting of fine particles of hydrous aluminum silicates and other minerals used in mak- \ning brick, tile, and pottery); silica (the basis for nearly all glass products); and alumina \nand silicon carbide (two abrasive materials used in grinding). Modern ceramics include \nsome of the preceding materials, such as alumina, whose properties are enhanced in \nvarious ways through modern processing methods. Newer ceramics include: carbides\u2014 \nmetal carbides such as tungsten carbide and titanium carbide, which are widely used \nas cutting tool materials; and nitrides\u2014metal and semimetal nitrides such as titanium \nnitride and boron nitride, used as cutting\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}

Examples include integrated circuits, which consist of \ncomponents such as transistors, diodes, and resistors that have been fabricated and \nelectrically connected on a small flat chip, usually made of silicon. The remarkable \nfeature about today\u2019s microelectronics devices is the huge number of components \nthat can be contained onto the chip. The capability to fabricate integrated circuits \ndates from the early 1960s and has advanced to the point where the current technol- \nogy is called giga-scale integration, meaning that chips are being produced consist- \ning of billions of components. Microelectronics has become so pervasive that a large \n.6 \nSection 1.6/Recent Developments in Manufacturing \n28 \n \n \nproportion of the common items used today are based on this technology. Two thirds \nof the products listed in Table 1.1 are either called electronics products or their func- \ntion and operation depend on electronics. In this book, the fabrication of integrated \ncircuits is covered in Chapter 33 and electronics assembly in Chapter 34. \n \nComputerization of Manufacturing The first digital computers date from the \nmid-1940s, but their applications in manufacturing came quite a few years later. In the \nmid-1960s direct numerical control was developed, in which mainframe com- puters \nwere employed to remotely control machine tools\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}

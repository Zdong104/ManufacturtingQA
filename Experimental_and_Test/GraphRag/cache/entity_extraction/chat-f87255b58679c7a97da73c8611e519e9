Corporate overhead expenses (Engineering, Research and development, \nAdministration, sales, marketing, etc.) add up to almost as much as manufacturing \ncost. Second, parts and materials are 50% of total manufacturing cost, so that is \nabout 20% of selling price. Third, direct labor is only about 12% of manufacturing \ncost, so that is less than 5% of selling price. Factory overhead, which includes the \ncategories Plant and machinery, depreciation, energy at 26% and Indirect labor at \n12%, adds up to more than three times Direct labor cost. \nThe issue of overhead costs can become quite complicated. A more complete \ntreatment can be found in [7] and most introductory accounting textbooks. Our \napproach in this book is simply to include an appropriate overhead expense in our \nlabor and equipment cost rates. For example, the labor cost rate is \nRH \nC = \n(1 + R  \n) \n(1.7) \nL \n60 \nLOH \nwhere CL = labor cost rate, $/min; RH = worker\u2019s hourly wage rate, $/hr; and RLOH = \nlabor overhead rate, %. \nResearch and \ndevelopment \nManufacturing cost \nEngineering \nAdministration, \nsales, marketing, \netc. \nProfit \n \n \n \n \n \nFIGURE 1.12 \nTypical break- \ndown of costs for \na manufactured\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}

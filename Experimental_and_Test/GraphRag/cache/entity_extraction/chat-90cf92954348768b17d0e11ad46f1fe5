These ad- \nvances gave British industry significant advantages \nover other nations, and England attempted to restrict \nexport of the new technologies. However, the revo- \nlution eventually spread to other European countries \nand the United States. Several inventions of the Indus- \ntrial Revolution greatly contributed to the development \nof manufacturing: (1) Watt\u2019s steam engine\u2014a new \npower-generating technology for industry; (2) machine \ntools, starting with John Wilkinson\u2019s boring machine \naround 1775 (Historical Note 21.1); (3) the spinning \njenny, power loom, and other machinery for the tex- \ntile industry that permitted significant increases in \nproductivity; and (4) the factory system\u2014a new way \nof organizing large numbers of production workers \nbased on division of labor. \nWhile England was leading the industrial revolu- \ntion, an important concept was being introduced in the \nUnited States: interchangeable parts manufacture. \nMuch credit for this concept is given to Eli Whitney \n(1765\u20131825), although its importance had been rec- \nognized by others [10]. In 1797, Whitney negotiated \na contract to produce 10,000 muskets for the U.S. \ngovernment.

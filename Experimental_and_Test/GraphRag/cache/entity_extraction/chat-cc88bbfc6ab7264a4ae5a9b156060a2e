On the other hand, there are risks associated \nwith contract manufacturing by the customer company. In turning over its prod- \nuct designs it loses control over its intellectual property, which might result in the \ncontract manufacturer becoming a competitor. The distinction between a contract \nmanufacturer and a supplier is perhaps subtle. A supplier is usually thought of as a \ncompany that provides materials and components for a customer who is engaged in \nproduction of a product, whereas a contract manufacturer accomplishes the whole \nproduction of the product. It may use suppliers itself. \nChina is of particular interest in this discussion of globalization and outsourcing \nbecause of (1) its fast-growing economy (it now boasts the second largest gross domes- tic \nproduct in the world), (2) the importance of manufacturing in that economy, and \n(3) the extent to which U.S. companies have outsourced work to China. To take advan- tage \nof the low labor rates, many U.S. companies have moved much of their production to \nChina (and other east Asian countries).

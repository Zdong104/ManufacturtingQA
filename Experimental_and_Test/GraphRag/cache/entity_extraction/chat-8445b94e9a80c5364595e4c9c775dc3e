For techno- \nlogical and economic reasons, manufacturing is impor- \ntant to the welfare of the United States and most other \ndeveloped and developing nations. Technology can be \ndefined as the application of science to provide society \nand its members with those things that are needed or \ndesired. Technology affects our daily lives, directly and \nindirectly, in many ways. Consider the list of products in \nTable 1.1. They represent various technologies that help our \nsociety and its members to live better. What do all these \nproducts have in common? They are all manufac- tured. \nThese technological wonders would not be avail- able to \nour society if they could not be manufactured. \nManufacturing is the critical factor that makes technol- \nogy possible. \nEconomically, manufacturing is an important means \nby which a nation creates material wealth. In the Unit- \ned States, the manufacturing industries account for \nonly about 12% of gross domestic product (GDP). A \ncountry\u2019s natural resources, such as agricultural lands, \nmineral deposits, and oil reserves, also create wealth. \nIn the U.S., agriculture, mining, and similar industries \naccount for less than 5% of GDP (agriculture alone is \nonly about 1%). Construction and public utilities make \nup around 5%. The rest is service industries, which in- \nclude retail\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}

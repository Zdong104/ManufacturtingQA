When a lattice \nstructure containing an edge dislocation is subjected to a shear stress, the material \ndeforms much more readily than in a perfect structure. This is explained by the fact \nthat the dislocation is put into motion within the crystal lattice in the presence of the \nstress, as shown in the series of sketches in Figure 2.12. Why is it easier to move a dis- \nlocation through the lattice than it is to deform the lattice itself? The answer is that \nthe atoms at the edge dislocation require a smaller displacement within the distorted lattice \nstructure to reach a new equilibrium position. Thus, a lower energy level is needed \nto realign the atoms into the new positions than if the lattice were missing the \ndislocation. A lower stress level is therefore required to effect the deformation. \nBecause the new position manifests a similar distorted lattice, movement of atoms \nat the dislocation continues at the lower stress level. \nThe slip phenomenon and the influence of dislocations have been explained here \non a very microscopic basis. On a larger scale, slip occurs many times over \nSection 2.3/Crystalline Structures \n46 \n \n \n \nFIGURE 2.12  Effect of dislocations in the lattice structure under stress.

These metals constitute the most important group commercially, more than three-\nfourths of the metal tonnage throughout the world. Pure iron has limited com- mercial \nuse, but when alloyed with carbon, iron has more uses and greater commer- cial value \nthan any other metal. Alloys of iron and carbon form steel and cast iron. \nSteel can be defined as an iron\u2013carbon alloy containing 0.02% to 2.11% carbon. It \nis the most important category within the ferrous metal group. Its composition often \nincludes other alloying elements as well, such as manganese, chromium, nickel, and \nmolybdenum, to enhance the properties of the metal. Applications of steel include \nconstruction (bridges, I-beams, and nails), transportation (trucks, rails, and rolling \nstock for railroads), and consumer products (automobiles and appliances). \nCast\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}

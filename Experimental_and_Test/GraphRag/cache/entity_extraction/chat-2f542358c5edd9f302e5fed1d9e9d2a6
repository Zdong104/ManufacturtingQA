Different types of \nfacilities are required for each of the three ranges of annual production quantities. \n \nLow-Quantity Production  In the low-quantity range (1\u2013100 units/year), the term job \nshop is often used to describe the type of production facility. A job shop makes low \nquantities of specialized and customized products. The products are typically \ncomplex, such as space capsules, prototype aircraft, and special machinery. The \nequipment in a job shop is general purpose, and the labor force is highly skilled. \nA job shop must be designed for maximum flexibility to deal with the wide prod- \nuct variations encountered (hard product variety). If the product is large and heavy, \nand therefore difficult to move, it typically remains in a single location during its fab- \nrication or assembly. Workers and processing equipment are brought to the product, \nrather than moving the product to the equipment. This type of layout is referred to \nas a fixed-position layout, shown in Figure 1.11(a).

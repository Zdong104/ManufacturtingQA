A metal \nstamping is a discrete item, but the sheet-metal coil from which it is made is continu- \nous (almost). Many discrete parts start out as continuous or semicontinuous prod- \nucts, such as extrusions and electrical wire. Long sections made in almost continuous \nlengths are cut to the desired size. An oil refinery is a better example of a continuous \nprocess. \n \nProduction Quantity and Product Variety The quantity of products made by a \nfactory has an important influence on the way its people, facilities, and procedures \nare organized. Annual production quantities can be classified into three ranges: (1) \nlow production, quantities in the range 1 to 100 units per year; (2) medium produc- \ntion, from 100 to 10,000 units annually; and (3) high production, 10,000 to millions\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}

Producing high-quality products should be a top priority of any \nmanufacturing firm in today\u2019s competitive environment. It means designing and \nbuilding products that conform to specifications and satisfy or exceed customer \nexpectations. Much of this effort is the responsibility of the QC department. \n \nManufacturing Economics \nIn Section 1.1.1, manufacturing was defined as a transformation process that adds \nvalue to a starting work material. In Section 1.1.2, we noted that manufacturing is \na commercial activity performed by companies that sell products to customers. It is \nappropriate to consider some of the economic aspects of manufacturing, and that is \nthe purpose of this section.

A \nworker who operates a piece of equipment may earn an hourly wage of $15/hr, but \nwhen fringe benefits and other overhead costs are figured in, the worker may cost \nthe company $30/hr. Corporate overhead consists of company expenses not related \nto the factory, such as sales, marketing, accounting, legal, engineering, research and \ndevelopment, office space, utilities, and health benefits.3 These functions are required in \nthe company, but they are not directly related to the cost of manufacturing. On the other \nhand, for pricing the product, they must be added in, or else the company will lose \nmoney on every product it sells. \nJ Black [1] offers some estimates of the typical costs associated with manufac- \nturing a product, presented in Figure 1.12. Several observations are worth making \nhere. First, total manufacturing costs constitute only 40% of the product\u2019s selling \nprice. Corporate overhead expenses (Engineering, Research and development, \nAdministration, sales, marketing, etc.) add up to almost as much as manufacturing \ncost. Second, parts and materials are 50% of total manufacturing cost, so that is \nabout 20% of selling price. Third, direct labor is only about 12% of manufacturing \ncost, so that is less than 5% of selling price.

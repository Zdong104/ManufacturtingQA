Twinning \ncan be defined as a mechanism of plastic deformation in which atoms on one side of \na plane (called the twinning plane) are shifted to form a mirror image of the other \nside of the plane. It is illustrated in Figure 2.13. The mechanism is important in HCP metals \n(e.g., magnesium, zinc) because they do not slip readily. Besides structure, another \nfactor in twinning is the rate of deformation. The slip mechanism requires more \ntime than twinning, which can occur almost instantaneously. Thus, when the \ndeformation rate is very high, metals twin that would otherwise slip. Low carbon \nsteel is an example that illustrates this rate sensitivity; when subjected to high strain \nrates it twins, whereas at moderate rates it deforms by slip. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFIGURE 2.13 Twinning \ninvolves the formation \nof an atomic mirror \nimage (i.e., a \u201ctwin\u201d) \non the opposite side \nof the twinning plane: \n(a) before and (b) after \ntwinning. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) \n(b) \nSection 2.4/Noncrystalline (Amorphous) Structures \n47 \n \n \n2.3.4 GRAINS AND GRAIN BOUNDARIES IN METALS \n \nA given block of metal may contain millions of individual crystals, called grains.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}

Quantity production involves the mass production of \nsingle parts on single pieces of equipment. It typically involves standard machines \n(e.g., stamping presses) equipped with special tooling (e.g., dies and material handling \ndevices), in effect dedicating the equipment to the production of one part type. Typi- \ncal layouts used in quantity production are the process layout and cellular layout. \nFlow line production involves multiple pieces of equipment or workstations \narranged in sequence, and the work units are physically moved through the sequence to \ncomplete the product. The workstations and equipment are designed specifically for \nthe product to maximize efficiency. The layout is called a product layout, and the \nworkstations are arranged into one long line, as in Figure 1.11(d), or into a series of \nconnected line segments. The work is usually moved between stations by mecha- \nnized conveyor. At each station, a small amount of the total work is completed on \neach unit of product. \nThe most familiar example of flow line production is the assembly line, associ- \nated with products such as cars and household appliances. The pure case of flow line \nproduction occurs when there is no variation in the products made on the line. Every \nproduct is identical, and the line is referred to as a single model production line.

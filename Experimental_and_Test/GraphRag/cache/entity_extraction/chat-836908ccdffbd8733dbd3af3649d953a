The underlying objective of lean production is the elimination of \nvarious forms of waste, such as producing defective parts, excessive inventories, and \nworkers waiting. Lean production is described in Sections 39.4 and 39.5 in our chap- \nter on process planning and production control. \nSix Sigma was started in the 1980s at Motorola Corporation in the United States. \nThe objective was to reduce variability in the company\u2019s processes and products to \nincrease customer satisfaction. Today, Six Sigma can be defined as \u201ca quality-focused \nprogram that utilizes worker teams to accomplish projects aimed at improving an \norganization\u2019s operational performance.\u201d5 Six Sigma is discussed in more detail in \nSection 40.4.2. \n \nGlobalization and Outsourcing The world is becoming more and more inte- \ngrated, creating an international economy in which barriers once established by \nnational boundaries have been reduced or eliminated. This has enabled a freer flow \nof goods and services, capital, technology, and people among regions and countries. \nGlobalization is the term that describes this trend, which was recognized in the late \n1980s and is now a dominant economic reality. Of interest here is that once under- \ndeveloped nations such as China, India, and Mexico have developed their manufac- \nturing infrastructures and technologies to a level such that they are now important \nproducers in the global economy\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}

The cost of \ntime consists of labor and equipment costs, which are applied to the average produc- \ntion time per piece as cost rates (e.g., $/hr). Thus, our cost model for production cost \nper piece can be stated as follows: \nCpc = Cm + (CL + Ceq)Tp + Ct \n(1.6) \nwhere Cpc = cost per piece, $/pc; Cm = starting material cost, $/pc; CL = labor cost \nrate, $/min; Ceq = equipment cost rate, $/min; Ct = cost of tooling that is used in the \nunit operation, $/pc; and Tp = average production time per piece, min/pc. If appli- \ncable, the cost of tooling Ct must be determined by dividing the actual cost of the \ntooling by the number of pieces between tool changes. \nSection 1\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}

Our coverage consists of (1) production cycle time analy- \nsis and (2) manufacturing cost models. \n \n \n1.5.1 \nPRODUCTION CYCLE TIME ANALYSIS \n \n\u201cTime is money\u201d, as the saying goes. The total time to make a product is one of the \ncomponents that determine its total cost and the price that can be charged for it. The \ntotal time is the sum of all of the individual cycle times of the unit operations needed \nto manufacture the product. As defined in Section 1.3, a unit operation is a single step \nin the sequence of steps required to make the final product. The cycle time of a unit \noperation is defined as the time that one work unit spends being processed or assem- \nbled. It is the time interval between when one work unit begins the operation and \nthe next unit begins. A typical production cycle time consists of the actual processing time \nplus the work handling time, for example, loading and unloading the part in the \nmachine. In some processes, such as machining, time is also required to periodically \nchange the tooling used in the operation when it wears out. In equation form, \nTc = To 1 Th 1 Tt \n(1.1) \nwhere Tc = cycle time of the unit operation, min/pc; To = actual processing time in \nthe operation, min/pc; Th = work handling time,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}

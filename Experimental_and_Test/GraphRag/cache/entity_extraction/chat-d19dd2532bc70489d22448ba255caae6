These issues are examined in the discus- \nsion of phase diagrams in Chapter 6. \nAnother difference in melting occurs with noncrystalline materials (glasses). In \nthese materials, there is a gradual transition from solid to liquid states. The solid \nmaterial gradually softens as temperature increases, finally becoming liquid at the \nmelting point. During softening, the material has a consistency of increasing plasticity \n(increasingly like a fluid) as it gets closer to the melting point. \nThese differences in melting characteristics among pure metals, alloys, and glass \nare portrayed in Figure 4.1. The plots show changes in density as a function of tem- \nperature for three hypothetical materials: a pure metal, an alloy, and glass. Plotted in \nthe figure is the volumetric change, which is the reciprocal of density. \nThe importance of melting in manufacturing is obvious. In metal casting \n(Chapters 10 and 11), the metal is melted and then poured into a mold cavity. Metals with \nlower melting points are generally easier to cast, but if the melting temperature is too \nlow, the metal loses its applicability as an engineering material. Melting char- \nacteristics of polymers are important in plastic molding and other polymer shaping \nprocesses (Chapter 13).

Question,Answer
Define manufacturing.,"Answer. The text defines manufacturing in two ways: technologically and economically. Technologically, manufacturing is the application of physical and chemical processes to alter the geometry, properties, and/or appearance of a given starting material to make parts or products; manufacturing also includes assembly of multiple parts to make products. Economically, manufacturing is the transformation of materials into items of greater value by means of one or more processing and/or assembly operations. The key point is that manufacturing adds value to the material by changing its shape or properties, or by combining it with other materials."
What is the difference between a thermoplastic polymer and a thermosetting polymer?,Answer. Thermoplastic polymers can be subjected to multiple heating and cooling cycles without substantially altering the molecular structure of the polymer. Thermosetting polymers chemically transform (cure) into a rigid structure on cooling from a heated plastic condition.
Manufacturing processes are usually accomplished as unit operations. Define unit operation.,Answer. A unit operation is a single step in the sequence of steps required to transform the starting material into a final product. A unit operation is generally performed on a single piece of equipment that runs independently of other operations in the plant.
"In manufacturing processes, what is the difference between a processing operation and an assembly operation?","Answer. A processing operation transforms a work material from one state of completion to a more advanced state that is closer to the final desired product. It changes the geometry, properties, or appearance of the starting material. In general, processing operations are performed on discrete work parts, but certain processing operations are also applicable to assembled items (e.g., painting a spot-welded car body). An assembly operation joins two or more components to create a new entity, called an assembly, subassembly, or some other term that refers to the joining process (e.g., a welded assembly is called a weldment)."
"One of the three general types of processing operations is shaping operations, which are used to create or alter the geometry of the work part. What are the four categories of shaping operations?","Answer. The four categories of shaping operations are (1) solidification processes, in which the starting material is a heated liquid or semifluid that cools and solidifies to form the part geometry; (2) particulate processing, in which the starting material is a powder, and the powders are formed and heated into the desired geometry; (3) deformation processes, in which the starting material is a ductile solid (commonly metal) that is deformed to shape the part; and (4) material removal processes, in which the starting material is a solid (ductile or brittle), from which material is removed so that the resulting part has the desired geometry."
What is the difference between net shape processes and near net shape processes?,Answer. Net shape processes are manufacturing processes that transform nearly all of the starting material into product and require no subsequent machining to achieve final part geometry. Near net shape processes are ones that require minimum machining to produce the final shape.
Identify the four types of permanent joining processes used in assembly.,"Answer. The four types are welding, brazing, soldering, and adhesive bonding."
What is a machine tool?,"Answer. The term developed during the Industrial Revolution, when it referred to power-driven machines used to operate cutting tools previously operated by hand. Modern machine tools are described by the same basic definition, except that the power is electrical rather than water or steam, and the level of precision and automation is much greater today."
What is the difference between special purpose and general purpose production equipment?,Answer. General-purpose equipment is more flexible and adaptable to a variety of jobs. It is commercially available for any manufacturing company to invest in. Special-purpose equipment is usually designed to produce a specific part or product in very large quantities. Another reason may be because the process is unique and commercial equipment is not available. Some companies with unique processing requirements develop their own special purpose equipment.
Define batch production and describe why it is often used for medium-quantity production.,"Answer. Batch production is where groups, lots, or batches of materials or parts are processed together through the manufacturing operations. All units in the batch are processed at a given station before the group proceeds to the next station. In a medium or low quantity production situation, the same machines are used to produce many types of products. Whenever a machine switches from one product to another, a changeover occurs. The changeover requires the machine setup to be torn down and set up for the new product. Batch production allows the changeover time to be distributed across a larger number of parts and hence reduce the average operation time per part."
What is the difference between a process layout and a product layout in a production facility?,Answer. A process layout is one where the machinery in a plant is arranged based on the type of process it performs. To produce a product it must visit the departments in the order of the operations that must be performed. This often includes large travel distances within the plant. A process layout is often used when the product variety is large and the operation sequences of products are dissimilar.  A product layout is one where the machinery is arranged based on the general flow of the products that will be produced. Travel distance is reduced because products will generally flow to the next machine in the sequence. A product layout works well when all products tend to follow the same sequence of production operations.
"What are the differences between primary, secondary, and tertiary industries? Give an example of each category.","Answer. A primary industry is one that cultivates and exploits natural resources, such as agriculture or mining. A secondary industry takes the outputs of primary industries and converts them to consumer and capital goods. Examples of secondary industries are textiles and electronics. A tertiary industry is in the service sector of the economy. Examples of tertiary industries are banking and education."
Name two departments that are typically classified as manufacturing support departments.,"Answer. A common organizational structure includes the following three manufacturing support departments: (1) manufacturing engineering, (2) production planning and control, and (3) quality control."
What are overhead costs in a manufacturing company?,"Answer. Overhead costs consist of all of the expenses of operating the company other than material, direct labor, and equipment."
Name and define the two categories of overhead costs in a manufacturing company.,"Answer. The two categories are (1) factory overhead and (2) corporate overhead. Factory overhead consists of the costs of running the factory excluding materials, direct labor, and equipment. This overhead category includes plant supervision, maintenance, insurance, heat and light, and so forth. Corporate overhead consists of company expenses not related to the factory, such as sales, marketing, accounting, legal, engineering, research and development, office space, utilities, and health benefits."
What is the difference between fixed costs and variable costs?,"Answer. A fixed cost remains constant for any level of production output, whereas variable costs are paid for as they are used. The cost of the factory and equipment are fixed costs. Direct labor and materials that are used to produce the product are variable costs."
What is meant by the term availability?,Answer. Availability is a reliability term which is simply the proportion uptime of the equipment.
What is the difference between consumer goods and a capital goods? Give some examples in each category.,"Answer. Consumer goods are products purchased directly by consumers, such as cars, personal computers, TVs, tires, and tennis rackets. Capital goods are those purchased by companies to produce goods and/or provide services. Examples of capital goods include aircraft, computers, communication equipment, medical apparatus, trucks and buses, railroad locomotives, machine tools, and construction equipment."
"What is the difference between soft product variety and hard product variety, as these terms are defined in the text?","Answer. Soft product variety is when there are only small differences among products, such as the differences among car models made on the same production line. In an assembled product, soft variety is characterized by a high proportion of common parts among the models. Hard product variety is when the products differ substantially, and there are few common parts, if any. The difference between a car and a truck exemplifies hard variety."
How are product variety and production quantity related when comparing typical factories?,"Answer. In general, production quantity is inversely related to product variety. A factory that produces a large variety of products will produce a smaller quantity of each. A company that produces a single product will produce a large quantity."
One of the dimensions of manufacturing capability is technological processing capability. Define technological processing capability.,"Answer. The technological processing capability of a plant (or company) is its available set of manufacturing processes. Certain plants perform machining operations, others roll steel billets into sheet stock, and others build automobiles. The underlying feature that distinguishes these plants is the processes they can perform. Technological processing capability includes not only the physical processes, but also the expertise possessed by plant personnel in these processing technologies."
What are the four categories of engineering materials used in manufacturing?,"Answer. The four categories of engineering materials are (1) metals, (2) ceramics, (3) polymers, and (4) composite materials, which consist of non-homogeneous mixtures of the other three types."
What is the definition of steel?,"Answer. Steel can be defined as an ironÐcarbon alloy containing 0.02% to 2.11% carbon. Its composition often includes other alloying elements as well, such as manganese, chromium, nickel, and molybdenum, to enhance the properties of the metal."
What are some of the typical applications of steel?,"Answer. Applications of steel include construction (e.g., bridges, I-beams, and nails), transportation (trucks, rails, and rolling stock for railroads), and consumer products (automobiles and appliances)."

Question,Answer
Why are the nontraditional material removal processes important?,Answer. Reasons for importance are: (1) need to shape new metal alloys and non-metals that are difficult to machine by conventional processes; (2) unusual and complex workpart geometries; and (3) need to avoid surface damage which is often associated with conventional machining.
"There are four categories of nontraditional machining processes, based on principal energy form. Name the four categories.","Answer. The four categories are: (1) mechanical, but not including conventional machining; (2) electrical; (3) thermal; and (4) chemical."
How does the ultrasonic machining process work?,"Answer. In ultrasonic machining, abrasives contained in a slurry are driven at high velocity against the work by a tool vibrating at low amplitude and high frequency. The tool oscillates in a direction perpendicular to the work surface, and is fed slowly into the work, so that the shape of the tool is formed in the part. The abrasives, impinging against the work surface, perform the cutting."
Describe the water jet cutting process.,"Answer. Water jet cutting uses a high-pressure, high-velocity stream of water directed at the work surface to cut of the work."
"What is the difference between water jet cutting, abrasive water jet cutting, and abrasive jet cutting?","Answer. WJC cuts with a narrow, high velocity water stream; AWJC adds abrasive grits to the water stream; and AJM cuts with abrasive particles that have been added to a high velocity air stream."
Name the three main types of electrochemical machining.,"Answer. The three types are: electrochemical machining, deburring, and grinding."
Identify the significant disadvantages of electrochemical machining.,"Answer. Disadvantages of ECM include: (1) cost of electrical power to operate the process, and (2) cost of disposal of electrolyte sludge."
How does increasing discharge current affect metal removal rate and surface finish in electric discharge machining?,"Answer. As discharge current increases, MRR increases and surface finish is degraded."
What is meant by the term overcut in electric discharge machining?,"Answer. Overcut refers to the difference between the size of the electrode (tool) in EDM and the size of the machined hole, cavity, or kerf (in wire EDM)."
Identify two major disadvantages of plasma arc cutting.,"Answer. Two disadvantages are: (1) rough surface on cut edge, and (2) metallurgical damage to cut surface."
What are some of the fuels used in oxyfuel cutting.,"Answer. Principal fuels are acetylene, MAPP (methylacetylene-propadiene), propylene, propane, and natural gas"
Name the four principal steps in chemical machining.,"Answer. The four steps are: (1) cleaning, (2) masking, (3) etching, and (4) demasking."
What are the three methods of performing the masking step in chemical machining.,"Answer. The three steps are: (1) cut and peel, (2) screen resist, and (3) photographic resist."
What is a photoresist in chemical machining?,"Answer. A photoresist is a masking material that is sensitive to light. When exposed, it chemically transforms and can be removed from the surface of the work, leaving the desired surface unprotected by the maskant."
"Much of the work at the Cut-Anything Company involves cutting and forming of flat sheets of fiber-glass for the pleasure boat industry. Manual methods based on portable saws are currently used to perform the cutting operation, but production is slow and scrap rates are high. The foreman says the company should invest in a plasma arc cutting machine, but the plant manager thinks it would be too expensive. What do you think? Justify your answer by indicating the characteristics of the process that make PAC attractive or unattractive in this application.","Answer. In plasma arc cutting, the workpart must be an electrically conductive material. Fiber glass is not electrically conductive. PAC is therefore not an appropriate process for this application."
"A furniture company that makes upholstered chairs and sofas must cut large quantities of fabrics. Many of these fabrics are strong and wear-resistant, which properties make them difficult to cut. What nontraditional process(es) would you recommend to the company for this application? Justify your answer by indicating the characteristics of the process that make it attractive.","Answer.  Water jet cutting would be an ideal process for this application. WJC cuts through fabrics quickly and cleanly, and the process could be readily automated."
"A wire EDM operation is used to cut out punch and die components from 25 mm thick tool steel plates. However, in preliminary cuts, the surface finish on the cut edge is poor. What changes in discharge current and frequency of discharges should be made to improve the finish?",Answer. Surface finish in EDM could be improved by reducing discharge current and increasing frequency of discharges.
"In a certain chemical blanking operation, a sulfuric acid etchant is used to remove material from a sheet of magnesium alloy. The sheet is 0.25 mm thick. The screen resist method of masking was used to permit high production rates to be achieved. As it turns out, the process is producing a large proportion of scrap. Specified tolerances of -0.025 to +0.025 mm are not being achieved. The foreman in the CHM department complains that there must be something wrong with the sulfuric acid. ""Perhaps the concentration is incorrect,"" he suggests. Analyze the problem and recommend a solution.","Answer. The problem in this chemical blanking operation is that the screen resist method of masking cannot achieve the tolerances specified. The photoresist method should have been used, and the process should be changed over to adopt this method."

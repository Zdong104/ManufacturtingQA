Question,Answer
"ï»¿37.1	Microsystem technology includes which of the following (more than one)?(a) LIGA technology, (b)	microelectromechanical systems, (c) micromachines, (d) nanotechnology, (e) precision engineering. Answer: (a), (b), and (c). 37.2	The typical range of feature sizes in microsystem technology is which one of the following? (a) 10- 3 m to 10-2 m, (b)10-6 m to 10-3 m, (c) 10-9 m to 10-6 m. Answer: (b). 37.3	Which of the following are current applications of microsystem technology in modern automobiles (more than one)? (a) air-bag release sensors, (b) alcohol blood level sensors, (c) driver identification sensors for theft prevention, (d) oil pressure sensors, (e) temperature sensors for cabin climate control. Answer: (a), (d), and (e). 37.4	The most common work material used in microsystem technology is which one of the following? (a) boron, (b) gold, (c) nickel, (d) potassium hydroxide, (e) silicon. Answer: (e). 37.5	The aspect ratio in microsystem technology is best defined by which one of the following? (a) degree of anisotropy in etched features, (b) height-to-width ratio of the fabricated features, (c) height-to-width ratio of the MST device, (d) length-to-width ratio of the fabricated features, (e) thickness-to-length ratio of the MST device. Answer: (b). 37.6	Which of the following forms of radiation have wavelengths shorter than the wavelength of ultraviolet light used in photolithography (more than one)? (a) electron beam radiation, (b) natural light, (c) X-ray radiation. Answer: (a) and (c). 37.7	Bulk micromachining refers to a relatively deep wet etching process into a single-crystal silicon substrate: (a) true or (b) false. Answer: (a). 37.8	In the LIGA process, the letters LIGA stand for which one of the following? (a) let it go already, (b)	little itty-bitty grinding apparatus, (c) lithographic applications, (d) lithography, electrodeposition, and plastic molding, (e) lithography, grinding, and alteration. Answer: (d). 37.9	Photofabrication means the same process as photolithography. (a) True or (b) false.  Answer: (b). Photofabrication is an industrial process in which ultraviolet exposure through a pattern mask causes a significant increase in the chemical solubility of an optically clear material, thus permitting a suitable etchant to remove the exposed regions much more rapidly. This is not the same as photolithography, in which resists are used to determine the regions to be etched. 37.10	The typical range of feature sizes in nanotechnology is which one of the following? (a) 10^-3 m to 10^-2 m, (b)10^-6 m to 10^-3 m, (c) 10^-9 m to 10^-6 m. Answer: (c).",

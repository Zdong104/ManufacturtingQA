Question,Answer
Why are abrasive processes technologically and commercially important?,"Answer. Important reasons include: (1) applications on all types of materials, (2) very fine finishes, and (3) close tolerances."
What are the five principal parameters of a grinding wheel?,"Answer. The parameters are: (1) abrasive material, (2) grit size, (3) bonding material, (4) wheel structure, which refers to the relative spacing of grains, and (5) wheel grade, which refers to the bond strength of the wheel in retaining abrasive grains."
What are some of the principal abrasive materials used in grinding wheels?,"Answer. The principal abrasive grit materials include: (1) aluminum oxide, (2) silicon carbide, (3) cubic boron nitride, and (4) diamond."
Name some of the principal bonding materials used in grinding wheels.,"Answer. The bonding materials in grinding wheels are: (1) vitrified bond - clay and ceramics, (2) silicate, (3) rubber, (4) resinoid, (5) shellac, and (6) metallic."
What is wheel structure?,"Answer. Wheel structure indicates the relative spacing of the abrasive grains in the wheel. An open structure is one in which the grains are far apart, and a dense structure indicates that the grains are close together."
What is wheel grade?,Answer. Wheel grade refers to the wheel's ability to retain abrasive grains during cutting. It indicates the bond strength of the bonding material used to shape the wheel. A soft grade indicates that the grains are released easily from the bonding material. A hard wheel is one which retains the abrasive grains.
Why are specific energy values so much higher in grinding than in traditional metal cutting processes?,Answer. Reasons for higher specific energy in grinding: (1) size effect - smaller chip size means higher specific energy; (2) extremely negative rake angles on the abrasive particles in a grinding wheel; and (3) not all of the grains in the wheel surface are engaged in cutting; some are plowing or deforming while others are simply rubbing and creating friction.
Grinding creates high temperatures. How is temperature harmful in grinding?,Answer. High temperatures in grinding create surface burns and cracks. High temperatures can also soften the surfaces of workparts that have been heat treated to obtain high hardness.
What are the three mechanisms of grinding wheel wear?,"Answer. The mechanisms are: (1) grain fracture, in which a portion of the grain breaks off during cutting; (2) attritious wear, in which the grains become dull during cutting; and (3) bond fracture, in which the grains are pulled out of the bonding material."
"What is dressing, in reference to grinding wheels?","Answer. Dressing is a procedure applied to worn grinding wheels to break off dull grits and expose fresh grits, and to remove chips of work material that have become clogged in the wheel. It uses a rotating disk or abrasive stick held against the wheel while it rotates."
"What is truing, in reference to grinding wheels?","Answer. Truing is similar to dressing, but it also restores the ideal cylindrical shape to the wheel. It uses a diamond-pointed tool fed slowly and precisely across the wheel while it rotates."
What abrasive material would one select for grinding a cemented carbide cutting tool?,Answer. Choose a diamond wheel.
What are the functions of a grinding fluid?,"Answer. Functions of a grinding fluid are: (1) reduce friction, (2) remove heat, (3) wash away chips, and (4) reduce workpiece temperature."
What is centerless grinding?,"Answer. Centerless grinding is a grinding operation in which cylindrical workparts (e.g., rods) are fed between two rotating wheels: (1) a high speed grinding wheel and (2) a low speed regulating wheel which is tilted at a slight angle to control the feed-through rate."
How does creep feed grinding differ from conventional grinding?,"Answer. In creep feed grinding, the depth of cut is very high - several thousand times higher than conventional grinding - and the feed rates are lower by the same proportion."
How does abrasive belt grinding differ from a conventional surface grinding operation?,"Answer. Instead of a grinding wheel, abrasive belt grinding uses abrasive particles bonded to a flexible cloth belt loop which is moved through a pulley system to obtain the speed motion. Parts are pressed against the belt to accomplish grinding."
Name some of the abrasive operations available to achieve very good surface finishes.,"Answer. High finish abrasive processes include: honing, lapping, superfinishing, buffing, and polishing."
A high speed steel broach (hardened) is to be resharpened to achieve a good finish. Specify the appropriate parameters of the grinding wheel for this job.,"Answer. Grinding wheel specification: Abrasive type: cubic boron nitride Grain size: small - high grit size number Bond material: vitrified bond Wheel grade: soft to medium Wheel specification: XX-B-150-P-XY-V-XZ-1/8, where XX, XY, and XZ are manufacturerâ€™s symbols."

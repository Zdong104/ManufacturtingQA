Question,Answer
"Welding can only be performed on metals that have the same melting point; otherwise, the metal with the lower melting temperature always melts while the other metal remains solid: (a) true, (b) false.",Answer. (b) Welding can be accomplished between certain combinations of dissimilar metals. Both metals melt.
"A fillet weld can be used to join which of the following joint types (more than one): (a) butt, (b) corner, (c) lap, (d) tee.","Answer. (b), (c), and (d)."
"A fillet weld has a cross-sectional shape that is approximately which one of the following? (a) rectangular, (b) round, (c) square, or (d) triangular.",Answer. (d)
"Groove welds are most closely associated with which one of the following joint types: (a) butt, (b) corner, (c) edge, (d) lap, (e) tee.",Answer. (a)
"A flange weld is most closely associated with which one of the following joint types: (a) butt, (b) corner, (c) edge, (d) lap, (e) tee.",Answer. (c)
"For metallurgical reasons, it is desirable to melt the weld metal with minimum energy input. Which one of the following heat sources is most consistent with this objective? (a) high power, (b) high power density, (c) low power, or (d) low power density.",Answer. (b)
"The amount of heat required to melt a given volume of metal depends strongly on which of the following properties (more than one)? (a) coefficient of thermal expansion, (b) heat of fusion, (c) melting temperature, (d) modulus of elasticity, or (e) thermal conductivity.",Answer. (b) and (c)
"Weld failures always occur in the fusion zone of the weld joint, since this is the part of the joint that has been melted: (a) true, (b) false.",Answer. (b) Failures also occur in the heat affected zone because metallurgical damage often occurs in this region.

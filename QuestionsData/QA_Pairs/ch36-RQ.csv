Question,Answer
What are the functions of a well-designed electronics package?,"Answer. The principal functions are: (1) power distribution and signal interconnection, (2) structural support, (3) environmental protection, (4) heat dissipation, (5) minimize delays in signal transmission."
Identify the levels of packaging hierarchy in electronics.,"Answer. The levels are: (0) chip intraconnections, (1) chip to package, (2) component to PCB, (3) PCB to rack or chassis, and (4) wiring and cabling inside a cabinet."
What is the difference between a track and a land on a printed circuit board?,"Answer. A track is a copper conducting path on a PCB, while a land is a small copper area for electrically attaching components."
Define what a printed circuit board (PCB) is.,Answer. A PCB is a laminated flat panel of insulating material to which electronic components are attached and electrically interconnected.
Name the three principal types of printed circuit board?,"Answer. The three types are: (1) single -sided board, (2) double -sided board, and (3) multilayer board."
What is a via hole in a printed circuit board?,Answer. A via hole is a hole in the printed circuit board whose sides are plated with copper to serve as a conducting path from one side of a PCB to the other or between intermediate layers in a multilayer board.
What are the two basic resist coating methods for printed circuit boards?,"Answer. The two methods are: (1) screening, such as silk screening, and (2) photolithography."
What is etching used for in PCB fabrication?,Answer. Etching is used to remove copper cladding on the PCB surface to define the tracks and lands of the circuit.
"What is continuity testing, and when is it performed in the PCB fabrication sequence?","Answer. Continuity testing is an electrical test in which contact probes are brought into contact with track and land areas to insure the existence of electrical conduction paths. Continuity tests are generally used: (1) after the bare board has been fabricated, and (2) after the board has been populated with components."
"What are the two main categories of printed circuit board assemblies, as distinguished by the method of attaching components to the board?","Answer. The two categories are: (1) pin-in-hole technology, also known as through-hole technology; and (2) surface mount technology."
What are some of the reasons and defects that make rework an integral step in the PCB fabrication sequence?,"Answer. Rework is required to correct the following types of defects: (1) replace defective components, (2) insert missing components, (3) repair faulty solder joints, and (4) repair of copper film that has lifted from the substrate surface."
Identify some of the advantages of surface mount technology over conventional through-hole technology.,"Answer. Advantages of SMT include: (1) smaller components, (2) higher packing densities, (3) components can be mounted on both sides of the board, (4) smaller PCBs are possible for the same function, (5) reduced number of holes drilled in the board, and (6) certain undesirable electrical effects are reduced, such as spurious surface capacitances and inductances."
Identify some of the limitations and disadvantages of surface mount technology?,"Answer. Limitations and disadvantages of SMT include: (1) components are more difficult for humans to handle, (2) SMT components are generally more expensive than THT components, (3) inspection, testing, and rework are more difficult, and (4) certain types of components are not available in SMT."
What are the two methods of component placement and soldering in surface mount technology?,"Answer. The two methods are: (1) adhesive bonding and wave soldering, and (2) solder paste and reflow soldering."
What is a solder paste?,Answer. A solder paste is a suspension of solder powders in a flux binder. The flux binder includes an adhesive that attaches the SMT components to the board surface. The solder constitutes about 85% of the total volume of the paste.
Identify the two basic methods of making electrical connections.,"Answer. The two methods are: (1) soldering, and (2) pressure connections."
Define crimping in the context of electrical connections?,Answer. Crimping involves the mechanical forming of a terminal barrel to form a permanent connection with the stripped end of a conductor wire.
What is press-fit technology in electrical connections?,Answer. A press-fit technology in the context of electrical connections is an interference fit between a terminal pin and the plated hole into which it is inserted.
Define what a terminal block is?,Answer. A terminal block consists of a series of evenly spaced receptacles that allow connection of individual wires or terminals.
What is a pin connector?,Answer. A pin connector is a connector with multiple pins or blades that are inserted into the holes of a mating receptacle to establish electrical contact.

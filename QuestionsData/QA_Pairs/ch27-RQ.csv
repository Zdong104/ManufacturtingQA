Question,Answer
Why are metals heat treated?,Answer. Metals are heat treated to effect metallurgical changes that beneficially alter properties.
Identify the important reasons why metals are annealed.,"Answer. The purposes of annealing include: (1) control properties, (2) reduce brittleness and improve toughness, (3) recrystallize cold-worked metals, and (4) relieve stresses from prior metal working."
What is the most important heat treatment for hardening steels?,Answer. Martensite formation by heating steel into the austenite region and quenching.
What is the mechanism by which carbon strengthens steel during heat treatment?,"Answer. If the steel is heat treated, martensite is formed which depends on the presence of carbon to create the nonequilibrium structure of this phase."
What information is conveyed by the TTT curve?,Answer. The TTT curve indicates what phases in the iron- carbon phase diagram will be produced under various conditions of cooling.
What function is served by tempering?,"Answer. Tempering involves heating and soaking of martensite for about one hour, followed by slow cooling to reduce brittleness, relieve stresses, and increase toughness and ductility."
Define hardenability?,Answer. Hardenability is the relative capacity of a steel to be hardened by transformation to martensite.
Name some of the elements which have the greatest effect on the hardenability of steel.,"Answer. Important hardenability elements are: chromium, manganese, molybdenum, and nickel."
Indicate how the hardenability alloying elements in steel affect the TTT curve.,"Answer. The hardenability alloying elements operate by pushing the nose of the TTT curve to the right, thereby permitting slower cooling rates for conversion of austenite to martensite."
Define precipitation hardening?,Answer. Precipitation hardening is a heat treatment in which very fine particles (precipitates) are formed so that dislocation movement is blocked and the metal is thus strengthened and hardened.
How does carburizing work?,"Answer. Carburizing adds carbon to the surface of low-C steel, thereby transforming the surface into high-C steel for grater hardening potential."
Identify the selective surface hardening methods.,"Answer. The selective surface hardening methods include: flame hardening, induction hardening, high-frequency (HF) resistance heating, electron beam (EB) heating, and laser beam (LB) heating."

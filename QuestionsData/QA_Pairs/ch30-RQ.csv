Question,Answer
What are the advantages and disadvantages of welding compared to other types of assembly operations?,"Answer. Advantages: (1) provides a permanent joint, so the parts are joined permanently; (2) joint strength is typically as high as strength of base metals; (3) most economical in terms of material usage; (4) versatile in terms of where it can be accomplished. Disadvantages: (1) usually performed manually, so labor cost is high and the skilled labor to perform it is sometimes scarce; (2) welding is inherently dangerous; (3) difficult to disassemble; (4) quality defects sometimes difficult to detect."
What were the two discoveries of Sir Humphrey Davy that led to the development of modern welding technology?,Answer. (1) electric arc and (2) acetylene gas.
What is meant by the term faying surface?,Answer. The faying surfaces are the contacting surfaces in a welded joint.
Define the term fusion weld.,Answer. A fusion weld is a weld in which the metal surfaces have been melted in order to cause coalescence.
What is the fundamental difference between a fusion weld and a solid state weld?,"Answer. In a fusion weld, the metal is melted. In a solid state weld, the metal is not melted."
What is an autogenous weld?,Answer. It is a fusion weld made without the addition of filler metal.
Discuss the reasons why most welding operations are inherently dangerous.,"Answer. Most welding operations are carried out at high temperatures that can cause serious burns on skin and flesh. In gas welding, the fuels are a fire hazard. In arc welding and resistance welding, the high electrical energy can cause shocks which are fatal to the worker. In arc welding, the electric arc emits intense ultraviolet radiation which can cause blinding. Other hazards include sparks, smoke, fumes, and weld spatter."
What is the difference between machine welding and automatic welding?,"Answer. An automatic welding operation uses a weld cycle controller which regulates the arc movement and workpiece positioning; whereas in machine welding, a human worker must continuously control the arc and the relative movement of the welding head and the workpart."
Name and sketch the five joint types.,"Answer. Five joint types are: (1) butt, (2) corner, (3) lap, (4) tee, (5) edge."
Define and sketch a fillet weld?,"Answer. A fillet weld is a weld joint of approximately triangular cross-section used to fill in the edges of corner, lap, and tee joints."
Define and sketch a groove weld?,Answer. A groove weld is a weld joint used to fill in the space between the adjoining edges of butt and other weld types except lap.
Why is a surfacing weld different from the other weld types?,"Answer. Because it does not join to distinct parts, but instead adds only filler metal to a surface."
What is the difference between a continuous weld and an intermittent weld as the terms apply to a fillet weld of a lap joint?,"Answer. A continuous weld would be made along the entire length of the fillet weld, whereas an intermittent weld would only fill the joint along certain portions (usually equally spaced) of the total length."
Why is it desirable to use energy sources for welding that have high heat densities?,Answer. Because the heat is concentrated in a small region for greatest efficiency and minimum metallurgical damage.
"What is the unit melting energy in welding, and what are the factors on which it depends?",Answer. The unit melting energy is the amount of heat energy required to melt one cubic inch or one cubic mm of metal.
Define and distinguish the two terms heat transfer efficiency and melting efficiency in welding.,Answer. Heat transfer efficiency is the ratio of the actual heat received at the work surface divided by the total heat generated by the source. Melting efficiency is the ratio of heat required for melting divided by the heat received at the work surface.
"What is epitaxial grain growth, and how is this form of solidification different from that which occurs in casting?",Answer. Epitaxial grain growth occurs when atoms from the molten pool solidify on already existing lattice sites of the adjacent solid base metal.
What is the heat affected zone (HAZ) in a fusion weld?,"Answer. The HAZ is a region of base metal surrounding the fusion zone in which melting has not occurred, but temperatures from welding were high enough to cause solid state microstructural changes."

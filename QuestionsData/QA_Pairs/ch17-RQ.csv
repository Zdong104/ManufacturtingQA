Question,Answer
"What is the difference between the traditional ceramics and the new ceramics, as far as raw materials are concerned?","Answer. The traditional ceramics are based on hydrous aluminum silicates (clay), whereas the new ceramics are based on man-made simpler compounds such as oxides, nitrides, and carbides."
List the basic steps in the traditional ceramics processing sequence.,"Answer. The sequence is: (1) preparation of raw materials, (2) shaping, (3) drying, and (4) firing."
What is the technical difference between crushing and grinding in the preparation of traditional ceramic raw materials?,Answer. Crushing is performed to reduce large lumps of mineral to smaller size. Grinding is a secondary process which further reduces the particle size to fine powder.
Describe the slip casting process in traditional ceramics processing.,"Answer. In slip casting a slurry of clay is poured into a plaster of Paris mold, whereupon water is absorbed from the slurry into the plaster to form a clay layer against the mold wall. The remaining slurry is usually poured out to leave a hollow part."
List and briefly describe some of the plastic forming methods used to shape traditional ceramics products.,"Answer. The plastic forming methods include: (1) hand modeling, molding, and throwing; (2) jiggering, which is a mechanized extension of hand throwing used to manufacture bowls and plates; (3) plastic pressing, in which a clay slug is pressed in a mold; and (4) extrusion, in which the clay is compressed through a die opening to make long sections of uniform cross-sectional shape."
What is the process of jiggering?,Answer. Jiggering is a clay forming process that uses a convex mold on a potters wheel. The clay is first pressed into rough shape and then rotated and formed with a jigger tool to final shape. It is suited to the manufacture of flatware.
What is the difference between dry pressing and semi-dry pressing of traditional ceramics parts?,"Answer. The difference is in the starting clay. For semi- dry pressing, the clay has a typical water content of 10% to 15%. For dry pressing, the water content is usually less than 5%. Dry clay has virtually no plasticity, and so this imposes certain limitations on part geometry in dry pressing."
What happens to a ceramic material when it is sintered?,"Answer. Sintering of green ceramics (or powdered metals) causes bonding between the ceramic grains, which is accompanied by densification and reduction of porosity."
What is the name given to the furnace used to fire ceramic ware?,Answer. Kiln.
What is glazing in traditional ceramics processing?,"Answer. Glazing refers to the process of putting a ceramic coating on the surface of the ceramic piece. The coating, usually consisting of ceramic oxides, is referred to as a glaze."
"Why is the drying step, so important in the processing of traditional ceramics, usually not required in processing of new ceramics?",Answer. Because water is usually not one of the ingredients in the new ceramics during forming. Drying is only needed when the green piece contains water.
Why is raw material preparation more important in the processing of new ceramics than for traditional ceramics?,Answer. Because the requirements on the strength of the finished product are usually more demanding for new ceramics.
What is the freeze drying process used to make certain new ceramic powders?,"Answer. In freeze drying, salts are dissolved in water and sprayed into small droplets which are immediately frozen; the water is then removed from the droplets in a vacuum chamber, and the freeze-dried salt is decomposed by heating to form the ceramic powders."
Describe the doctor-blade process.,"Answer. In the doctor-blade process, a ceramic slurry is flowed onto a moving film which flows under a wiper blade, so that the resulting ceramic is in the form of a thin green sheet which is dried and reeled onto a spool for subsequent shaping and sintering."
"Liquid phase sintering is used for WC-Co compacts, even though the sintering temperatures are below the melting points of either WC or Co. How is this possible?","Answer. The melting point of cobalt is reduced when WC is dissolved in it. At the sintering temperatures used for WC-Co, WC gradually dissolves in the cobalt, reducing its melting point to the sintering temperature. Thus does liquid phase sintering occur in the WC-Co system."
What are some design recommendations for ceramic parts?,"Answer. The guidelines include: (1) subject ceramic parts to compressive, not tensile loads; (2) ceramics are brittle, so avoid impact loading; (3) part geometries should be simple; (4) use large radii on inside and outside corners; (5) take into account shrinkage; (6) no screw threads."

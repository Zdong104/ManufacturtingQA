Question,Answer
Identify and briefly describe the three basic components of a numerical control system.,"Answer. The three basic components are: (1) part program, (2) machine control unit, and (3) processing equipment. The part program is the detailed set of commands to be followed by the processing equipment. Each command specifies a position or motion that is to be accomplished by the workhead relative to the processed object. The machine control unit in modern NC technology is a microcomputer which stores the program and executes it by converting each command into actions by the processing equipment, one command at a time. The processing equipment accomplishes the sequence of processing steps to transform the starting workpart into a completed part. It operates under the control of the machine control unit according to the set of instructions contained in the part program."
What is the difference between point-to-point and continuous path in a motion control system?,"Answer. In point-to-point, the motion is from one location in space to the next with no regard for the path taken between starting and final locations. In continuous path, the trajectory of the movement is controlled."
What is the difference between absolute positioning and incremental positioning?,"Answer. In absolute positioning, the locations are defined relative to the origin of the axis system. In incremental positioning, each succeeding location is defined relative to the previous location."
What is the difference between an open loop positioning system and a closed loop positioning system?,"Answer. In a closed loop system, measurements of the output (position) are fed back to verify that it corresponds to the desired input value. In an open loop system, there is no feedback of the output value."
Under what circumstances is a closed loop positioning system preferable to an open loop system?,"Answer. When there is a significant reaction force resisting the motion of the positioning system, a closed loop system is preferred."
Explain the operation of an optical encoder.,"Answer. An optical encoder is a sensor for measuring angular position and rotational velocity. It consists of a light source, a photodetector, and a disk containing a series of slots through which the light source can shine to energize the photodetector. The disk is connected, either directly or through a gear train, to a rotating shaft whose angular position and velocity are to be measured. As the shaft rotates, the slots cause the light source to be seen by the photocell as a series of flashes, which are converted into an equivalent series of electrical pulses. By counting the pulses and computing the frequency of the pulse train, angular position and rotational speed can be determined."
Why should the electromechanical system be the limiting factor in control resolution rather than the controller storage register?,Answer. Because the control resolution in the controller storage register can be increased simply by increasing the number of bits used to define the axis location.
What is manual data input in NC part programming?,Answer. Manual data input refers to a method of programming in which the machine tool operator accomplishes the programming of the NC machine using a menu-driven procedure. Programming is simplified to minimize the amount of training required by the operator.
Identify some of the non-machine tool applications of numerical control.,"Answer. The applications include: (1) arc welding and resistance welding, (2) electronic component insertion, (3) electrical wire wrap machines, (4) drafting, (5) tape laying for fiber reinforced polymer composites, and (6) coordinate measuring machines."
What are some of the benefits usually cited for NC compared to using manual alternative methods?,"Answer. Advantages of NC include: (1) reduced non- productive time, (2) lower manufacturing lead times, (3) simpler fixtures, (4) greater flexibility, (5) improved accuracy, and (6) reduced human error."
What is an industrial robot?,Answer. An industrial robot is a programmable machine possessing certain anthropomorphic features. The most common feature is a manipulator (arm) that can be programmed to perform industrial tasks.
How is an industrial robot similar to numerical control?,Answer. They are both positioning systems that can be programmed and reprogrammed.
What is an end effector?,Answer. An end effector is the special tooling that is attached to the robot's wrist to perform a particular application. A gripper is one form of end effector.
"In robot programming, what is the difference between powered leadthrough and manual leadthrough?","Answer. In powered leadthrough, a teach pendant which controls the drive motors of the individual joints is used to move the manipulator into the desired joint positions, which are then recorded into memory. In manual leadthrough, the manipulator is physically moved through the desired sequence of positions, which are recorded into memory for later execution."
What is a programmable logic controller?,"Answer. A programmable logic controller (PLC) is a microcomputer-based device that uses programmed instructions to implement logic, sequencing, timing, counting, and arithmetic functions to control industrial machinery and processes."

Question,Answer
Define manufacturing engineering.,Answer. Manufacturing engineering is a technical staff department responsible for planning the manufacturing processes for a product and its components.
What are the principal activities in manufacturing engineering?,"Answer. Principal activities of manufacturing engineering are: (1) process planning, (2) day-to-day technical problem solving and continuous improvement, (3) advising the product designers in design for manufacturability, and (4) advanced manufacturing planning, which includes evaluation of new processing technologies, manufacturing research, and so forth."
Identify some of the details and decisions that are included within the scope of process planning.,"Answer. Table 41.1 lists the following details and decisions in process planning: (1) what processes are required and the sequence in which they are performed; (2) equipment selection; (3) what tools, dies, molds, fixtures, and gages will be needed; (4) identification of cutting tools and cutting conditions for machining operations; (5) methods for manual operations (e.g., assembly) and manual portions of machine cycles (e.g., loading and unloading a production machine); (6) work standards (time standards for each operation); (7) estimates of production costs; (8) consideration must be given to the problem of moving materials and work-in-progress in the factory; and (9) plant layout and facilities design."
What is a route sheet?,Answer. A route sheet is a listing of the production operations and their sequence required to make a given part. It also lists the equipment and special tooling that is required.
What is the difference between a basic process and a secondary process?,"Answer. A basic process establishes the starting geometry of the work material; e.g., casting, rolled sheet metal, drawn metal bar. Secondary processes are used to refine the starting geometry and transform the material into final shape and size; machining and sheet metal pressworking are common secondary processes."
What is a precedence constraint in process planning?,"Answer. A precedence constraint is a limitation on the order in which processing or assembly operations can be performed on a given workpart; for example, a hole must be drilled before it can be tapped."
"In the make or buy decision, why is it that purchasing a component from a vendor may cost more than producing the component internally, even though the quoted price from the vendor is lower than the internal price?",Answer. Because purchasing the component may cause idle equipment and staff in the factory that the company must still pay for. See Example 41.1 in the text.
Identify some of the important factors that should enter into the make or buy decision.,"Answer. The factors include: (1) cost, (2) whether the process is available internally, (3) production quantity, (4) Product life, (5) whether or not the component is a standard commercially available hardware item, (6) supplier reliability, and (7) possible need for alternative sources."
Name three of the general principles and guidelines in design for manufacturability?,Answer. Table 41.5 lists the following DFM principles and guidelines: (1) Minimize number of components. (2) Use standard commercially available components. (3) Use common parts across product lines. (4) Design for ease of part fabrication. (5) Design parts with tolerances that are within process capability. (6) Design the product to be foolproof during assembly. (7) Minimize flexible components. (8) Design for ease of assembly. (9) Use modular design. (10) Shape parts and products for ease of packaging. (11) Eliminate or reduce adjustment required.
What is concurrent engineering and what are its important components?,"Answer. Concurrent engineering is an approach used by companies to reduce the time to bring a new product to market. It includes: (1) design for manufacturability, (2) design for quality, (3) design for life cycle, and (4) design for cost. It also includes certain organizational changes which attempt to bring different functions in the company together during product design to consider all possible aspects of the product."
Identify some of the enabling technologies for concurrent engineering?,"Answer. Enabling technologies mentioned in the text are rapid prototyping and computer integrated manufacturing (which includes CAD/CAM). In addition, electronic data interchange should probably be included in the list."
What is meant by the term design for life cycle?,"Answer. Design for life cycle means that factors relating to the product after it has been manufactured should be taken into consideration in design. These factors include installability, reliability, maintainability, serviceability, upgradeability, and disposability."

Question,Answer
"The shear viscosity of a polymer melt is affected by which of the following (more than one)? (a) degree of polymerization, (b) polymer type, (c) rate of flow, (d) temperature.","Answer. (a), (b), (c), and (d). Degree of polymerization (a) is correlated with molecular weight, and rate of flow (c) is related to shear rate. The other parameters, (b) and (d), are probably more recognizable to the reader as correct answers to this question."
"The forward movement of polymer melt in an extruder barrel is resisted by drag flow, which is caused by the resistance to flow through the die orifice: (a) true or (b) false.",Answer. (b) Drag flow is the forward motion of the melt caused by the Archimedian screw principle in the barrel. The resistance to forward flow is called back pressure flow.
"Which three of the following are sections of a conventional extruder barrel for thermoplastics? (a) compression section, (b) die section, (c) feed section, (d) heating section, (e) metering section, and (f) shaping section.","Answer. (a), (c), and (e)"
"Which of the following processes is not associated with the production of plastic sheet and film (more than one)? (a) blown-film extrusion process, (b) calendering, (c) chill-roll extrusion, (d) doctor blade method, or (e) slit-die extrusion.","Answer. (d) Calendering is more closely associated with rubber coating of materials such as textiles, but should be included in our list of plastic sheet and film-making processes."
"Spinning in the production of synthetic fibers refers to which of the following: (a) extrusion of polymer melt through small die openings, (b) drawing the strands to elongate and thin them, (c) both of the above, or (d) none of the above.",Answer. (c)
"The principal components of an injection molding machine are which two of the following? (a) clamping unit, (b) hopper, (c) injection unit, (d) mold, and (e) part ejection unit.",Answer. (a) and (c)
"The parting line in injection molding is which one of the following: (a) the lines formed where polymer melt meets after flowing around a core in the mold, (b) the narrow gate sections where the parts are separated from the runner, (c) where the clamping unit is joined to the injection unit in the molding machine, (d) where the two mold halves come together, (e) none of the above.",Answer. (d)
"The function of the ejection system is to (one best answer): (a) move polymer melt into the mold cavity, (b) open the mold halves after the cavity is filled, (c) remove the molded parts from the runner system after molding, (d) separate the part from the cavity after molding, (e) none of the above.",Answer. (d)
"A three-plate mold offers which of the following advantages when compared to a two-plate mold (more than one)? (a) automatic separation of parts from runners, (b) gating is usually at the base of the part to reduce weld lines, (c) sprue does not solidify, (d) stronger molded parts, (e) none of the above.",Answer. (a) and (b)
"Which of the following defects or problems is associated with injection molding (more than one)? (a) bambooing, (b) die swell, (c) drag flow, (d) flash, (e) melt fracture, (f) short shots, or (g) sink marks.","Answer. (d), (f), and (g)"
"In rotational molding, centrifugal force is used to force the polymer melt against the surfaces of the mold cavity where solidification occurs: (a) true or (b) false.",Answer. (b) It is the force of gravity in the doubly rotating mold that forces the polymer against the mold surfaces.
"Use of a parison is associated with which one of the following plastic shaping processes? (a) bi-injection molding, (b) blow molding, (c) compression molding, (d) pressure thermoforming, or (e) sandwich molding.",Answer. (b)
"A thermoforming mold with a convex form is called which one of the following (may be more than one)? (a) a die, (b) a negative mold, (c) a positive mold, or (d) a three-plate mold.",Answer. (c)
"The term encapsulation refers to which one of the following plastics shaping processes? (a) casting, (b) compression molding, (c) extrusion of hollow forms, (d) injection molding in which a metal insert is encased in the molded part, or (e) vacuum thermoforming using a positive mold.",Answer. (a)
"Which of the following terms applies to the processing of foam plastics (more than one)? (a) chemical blowing agents, (b) open cell structure, (c) powder injection molding, (d) sandwich molding, (e) structural foam molding, (f) all of the above.","Answer. (a), (b), (d), and (e)."
"The two most common polymer foams are which of the following? (a) polyacetal, (b) polyethylene, (c) polystyrene, (d) polyurethane, and (e) polyvinylchloride.",Answer. (c) and (d)

"Which of the following processes are classified as solid state welding (more than one)? (a) CW, (b)	HPW, (c) LBW, and (d) OAW.",Answer. (a) and (b)
"An electric arc is a discharge of current across a gap in an electrical circuit. The arc is sustained in arc welding processes by the transfer of molten metal across the gap between the electrode and the work: (a) true, (b) false.","Answer. (b) The arc is sustained, not by the transfer of molten metal, but by the presence of a thermally ionized column of gas through which the current flows."
"Which one of the following arc welding processes uses a nonconsumable electrode? (a) FCAW, (b)	GMAW, (c) GTAW, or (d) SMAW.",Answer. (c)
"MIG welding is a term sometimes applied when referring to which one of the following processes? (a) FCAW, (b) GMAW, (c) GTAW, or (d) SMAW.",Answer. (b)
"""Stick"" welding is a term sometimes applied when referring to which one of the following processes? (a) FCAW, (b) GMAW, (c) GTAW, or (d) SMAW.",Answer. (d)
"Which of the following AW processes uses an electrode consisting of continuous consumable tubing containing flux and other ingredients in its core? (a) FCAW, (b) GMAW, (c) GTAW, or (d) SMAW.",Answer. (a)
"Which one of the following arc welding processes produces the highest temperatures? (a) CAW, (b)	PAW, (c) SAW, or (a) TIG.",Answer. (b)
"Shielding gases used for welding do not include which of the following (more than one)? (a) argon, (b)	carbon monoxide, (c) helium, (d) hydrogen, and (e) nitrogen.","Answer. (b), (d), and (e)"
"Resistance welding processes make use of the heat generated by electrical resistance to achieve fusion of the two parts to be joined; no pressure is used in these processes, and no filler metal is added: (a) true, (b) false.",Answer. (b) Pressure is applied in RW processes and is key to the success of these processes.
"Metals that are easiest to weld in resistance welding are ones that have low resistivities since low resistivity assists in the flow of electrical current: (a) true, or (b) false.","Answer. (b) Metals with low resistivities, such as aluminum and copper, are difficult to weld in RW. Higher resistance is required in the conversion of electrical power to heat energy; hence, metals with high resistivity are generally preferable."
"Oxyacetylene welding is the most widely used oxyfuel welding process because acetylene mixed with an equal volume of air burns hotter than any other commercially available fuel: (a) true, (b) false.",Answer. (a)
"The term ""laser"" stands for ""light actuated system for effective reflection"": (a) true, (b) false.","Answer. (b) Laser stands for ""light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation."""
"Which of the following solid state welding processes applies heat from an external source (more than one)? (a) diffusion welding, (b) forge welding, (c) friction welding, (d) ultrasonic welding.",Answer. (a) and (b)
"The term weldability takes into account not only the ease with which a welding operation can be performed, but also the quality of the resulting weld: (a) true, (b) false.",Answer. (a)
"Copper is a relatively easy metal to weld because its thermal conductivity is high: (a) true, (b) false.","Answer. (b) True that copper has a high thermal conductivity, one of the highest of any metal, but this is one of the main reasons why copper is generally difficult to weld. The heat readily flows into the body of the parts that are to be welded, rather than remaining at the localized region where the joint is to be made."

Question,Answer
Name the principal groups of processes included in fusion welding.,"Answer. Arc welding, resistance welding, oxyfuel welding, and ""other."" The other category includes EBW, LBW, thermit welding, and others."
What is the fundamental feature that distinguishes fusion welding from solid state welding?,"Answer. In fusion welding, melting occurs at the faying surfaces; in solid state welding, no melting occurs."
Define what an electrical arc is.,"Answer. An electrical arc is a discharge across a gap in a circuit. In arc welding, the arc is sustained by a thermally ionized column of gas through which the current can flow."
"What do the terms arc-on time, arc time, and operating factor have in common? Provide a definition of these terms.",Answer. The three terms mean the same thing: the proportion of the total time in a shift that the arc is actually on.
Electrodes in arc welding are divided into two categories. Name and define the two types.,"Answer. Consumable and nonconsumable. The consumable type, in addition to being the electrode for the process, also provide filler metal for the welding joint. The nonconsumable type are made of materials that resist melting, such as tungsten and carbon."
What are the two basic methods of arc shielding?,"Answer. (1) Shielding gas, such as argon and helium; and (2) flux, which covers the welding operation and protects the molten pool from the atmosphere."
Why is the heat transfer efficiency greater in arc welding processes that utilize consumable electrodes?,Answer. Because molten metal from the electrode is transferred across the arc and contributes to the heating of the molten weld pool.
Describe the shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) process.,Answer. SMAW is an arc welding process that uses a consumable electrode consisting of a filler metal rod coated with chemicals that provide flux and shielding.
Why is the shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) process difficult to automate?,"Answer. Because the stick electrodes must be changed frequently, which would be difficult to do automatically. It is much easier to automate the feeding of continuous filler wire, such as in GMAW, FCAW, SAW, or GTAW."
Describe submerged arc welding (SAW).,"Answer. SAW is an arc welding process that uses a continuous, consumable bare wire electrode, and arc shielding is provided by a cover of granular flux."
Describe electrogas welding (EGW) process and identify its major application.,"Answer. EGW is an arc welding process that uses a continuous consumable electrode, either flux-cored wire or bare wire with externally supplied shielding gas, and molding shoes to contain the molten pool."
Why are the temperatures much higher in plasma arc welding than in other AW processes?,"Answer. Because the arc is restricted in diameter, thus concentrating the energy into a smaller area, resulting in much higher power densities."
Define resistance welding.,Answer. RW consists of a group of fusion welding processes that utilize a combination of heat and pressure to accomplish coalescence of the two faying surfaces. Most prominent in the group is resistance spot welding.
What are the desirable properties of a metal that would provide good weldability for resistance welding?,"Answer. High resistivity, low electrical and thermal conductivity, and low melting point."
Describe the sequence of steps in the cycle of a resistance spot welding operation.,"Answer. The steps are: (1) the parts are inserted between electrodes, (2) squeeze the parts between the electrodes, (3) weld, in which the current is switched on for a brief duration (0.1 to 0.4 sec), (4) hold, during which the weld nugget solidifies, and (5) the electrodes are opened and the parts removed."
What is resistance projection welding?,Answer. RPW is a resistance welding process in which coalescence occurs at one or more relatively small points on the parts; the contact points are designed into the geometry of the parts as embossments or projections.
Describe cross-wire welding.,Answer. Cross-wire welding is a form of resistance projection welding used to fabricate welded wire products such as shopping carts and stove grills.
Why is the oxyacetylene welding process favored over the other oxyfuel welding processes?,Answer. Because acetylene and oxygen burn hotter than other oxyfuels.
Define pressure gas welding.,Answer. PGW is a fusion welding process in which coalescence is obtained over the entire contact surfaces of the two parts by heating them with an appropriate fuel mixture and then applying pressure to bond the surfaces.
Electron beam welding has a significant disadvantage in high-production applications. What is that disadvantage?,Answer. EBW is usually carried out in a vacuum for a high quality weld. The time to draw the vacuum adds significantly to the production cycle time.
Laser beam welding and electron beam welding are often compared because they both produce very high power densities. LBM has certain advantages over EBM. What are they?,Answer. (1) No vacuum chamber is required and (2) no x-rays are emitted in LBM; and (3) the laser beam can be focused and directed with conventional optical mirrors and lenses.
"There are several modern-day variations of forge welding, the original welding process. Name the variations.","Answer. (1) Cold welding, (2) roll welding, (3) and hot pressure welding."
There are two basic types of friction welding. Describe and distinguish the two types.,"Answer. The two types are: (1) continuous-drive friction welding and (2) inertia friction welding. In continuous-drive friction welding, one part is rotated at a constant speed and forced into contact with the stationary part with a certain force so that friction heat is generated at the interface; when the right temperature is reached, the rotating part is stopped abruptly and the two parts are forced together at forging pressures. In inertia friction welding, the rotating part is connected to a flywheel which is brought up to proper speed; then the flywheel is disengaged from the drive motor and the parts are forced together, so that the kinetic energy of the flywheel is converted to friction heat for the weld."
What is a sonotrode in ultrasonic welding?,Answer. It is the actuator which is attached to one of the two parts to be welded with USW and which provides the oscillatory motion that results in coalescence of the two surfaces.
"Distortion (warpage) is a serious problem in fusion welding, particularly arc welding. What are some of the measures that can be taken to reduce the incidence and extent of distortion?","Answer. The following measures, explained in the text in Section 29.6, can be used to reduce warpage in arc welding: (1) welding fixtures, (2) presetting of the parts in relative orientations to compensate for warpage, (3) heat sinks, (4) tack welding at several points along the joint rather than continuous weld, (5) balance the weld about the neutral axis of the part, (6) selecting proper welding conditions, (7) preheating of base parts, (8) stress relief of the weldment, and (9) proper design of the weldment to minimize warpage."
What are some of the important welding defects?,"Answer. (1) cracks, (2) cavities, (3) solid inclusions, (4) incomplete fusion, (5) imperfect shape or contour of weld cross-section."
What are the three basic categories of inspection and testing techniques used for weldments? Name some typical inspections and/or tests in each category.,"Answer. The three categories are: (1) visual inspection, which includes dimensional checks and inspection for warpage, cracks, and other visible defects; (2) nondestructive evaluation, which includes dye-penetrant, magnetic particle, ultrasonic, and radiographic tests; and (3) destructive tests, which includes conventional mechanical tests adapted to weld joints, and metallurgical tests."
Identify the factors that affect weldability.,"Answer. Factors affect weldability include: (1) welding process, (2) metal properties (e.g., melting point, thermal conductivity, coefficient of thermal expansion), (3) whether the base metals are similar or dissimilar (dissimilar base metals are generally more difficult to weld), (4) surface condition (surfaces should be clean and free of oxides, moisture, etc.), and (5) filler metal and its composition relative to the base metals."
What are some of the design guidelines for weldments that are fabricated by arc welding?,"Answer. The guidelines for weldments by arc welding include: (1) Good fit-up of parts to be welded is important to maintain dimensional control and minimize distortion. Machining is sometimes required to achieve satisfactory fit-up. (2) The design of the assembly must provide access room to allow the welding gun to reach the welding area. (3) Whenever possible, design of the assembly should allow flat welding to be performed, as opposed to horizontal, vertical, or overhead arc welding positions."

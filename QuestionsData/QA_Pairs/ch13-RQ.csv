Question,Answer
What are some of the reasons why the plastic shaping processes are important?,"Answer. Some of the reasons are: (1) many of the processes are net shape processes; (2) in general, less energy employed than in metalworking processes; (3) lower temperatures are required to process plastics than metals or ceramics; (4) great flexibility in geometry; and (5) painting and other finishing processes generally not required."
"Identify the main categories of plastics shaping processes, as classified by the resulting product geometry.","Answer. The categories are: (1) extrusion, (2) molding, (3) forming of continuous sheets and films, (4) fibers, (5) foamed products, and (6) discrete formed sheets and films."
Viscosity is an important property of a polymer melt in plastics shaping processes. Upon what parameters does viscosity depend?,"Answer. Viscosity of a polymer melt depends on: (1) temperature, and (2) shear rate. Of course, (3) the molecular weight of the polymer also affects viscosity."
How does the viscosity of a polymer melt differ from most fluids that are Newtonian.,"Answer. A polymer melt exhibits pseudoplasticity, which means that its value decreases with increasing shear rate."
"Besides viscosity, what other properties of a polymer melt are important in plastics processing? Briefly define each of the properties identified.","Answer. Other properties include: viscoelasticity, a combination of viscous and elastic properties which cause the melt to exhibit memory - the tendency to return to its previous shape, as exhibited by die swell in extrusion."
Define die swell in extrusion.,Answer. Die swell is the tendency of the extrudate to expand in cross-section dimensions immediately on exiting the die orifice. It results from the viscoelastic properties of the polymer melt.
Briefly describe the plastic extrusion process.,"Answer. In plastic extrusion, a polymer melt is compressed to flow through a die orifice and thus the continuous length of the plastic assumes a cross-sectional shape that is approximately the same as the profile of the orifice."
The barrel and screw of an extruder are generally divided into three sections; identify the sections.,"Answer. (1) feed section, in which the feed stock is fed from the hopper and heated; (2) compression section, in which the polymer changes to a viscous fluid; and (3) metering section, in which pressure is developed to pump the plastic through the die orifice."
What are the functions of the screen pack and breaker plate at the die end of the extruder barrel?,"Answer. The functions are: (1) filter dirt and lumps, (2) build pressure, (3) straighten the flow and remove memory."
What are the various forms of extruded shapes and corresponding dies?,"Answer. (1) solid profiles, such as rounds and L-shapes; (2) hollow profiles, such as tubes; (3) wire and cable coating; (4) sheet and film; and (5) filaments (continuous fibers)."
What is the distinction between plastic sheet and film?,"Answer. Thickness. Sheet stock has a thickness greater than 0.020 in (0.5 mm), while film stock is less than 0.020 in (0.5 mm) thick."
What is the blown-film process for producing film stock?,Answer. The blown-film process is a widely used process for making thin polyethylene film for packaging. It combines extrusion and blowing to produce a tube of thin film. The process begins with the extrusion of a tube which is immediately drawn upward while still molten and simultaneously expanded in size by air inflated into it through the die mandrel.
Describe the calendering process.,"Answer. Calendering is a process for producing sheet and film stock out of rubber or rubbery thermoplastics such as plasticized PVC. In the process, the initial feedstock is passed through a series of rolls to work the material and reduce its thickness to the desired gage."
Polymer fibers and filaments are used in several applications; what is the most important application?,Answer. Textiles.
"Technically, what is the difference between a fiber and a filament?","Answer. A fiber is a long, thin strand of material whose length is at least 100 times its diameter; a filament is a fiber of continuous length."
"Among the synthetic fiber materials, which are the most important?","Answer. Polyester is the most important commercially, followed by nylon, acrylics, and rayon."
"Briefly describe the injection molding process.Answer. Injection molding is a process in which a polymer is heated to a highly plastic state and forced to fl ow under high pressure into a mold cavity, where it solidifi es. The molded part, called a molding, is then removed from the cavity. The process produces discrete components that are almost always net shape. The production cycle time is typically in the range of 10 to 30 sec, although cycles of 1 min or longer are not uncommon for large parts. Also, the mold may contain more than one cavity, so that multiple moldings are produced each cycle. A 13.18	An injection molding machine is divided into two principal components; identify them.",Answer. The components of an injection molding machine are: (1) the injection unit and (2) the clamping unit.
What are the two basic types of clamping units?,"Answer. The clamping units are: (1) mechanical toggle clamp and (2) hydraulic. In addition, there are hydromechanical units which combine hydraulic and mechanical actuations."
Gates in injection molds have several functions; name them.,"Answer. The functions of gates in an injection mold are: (1) to increase shear rate to increase viscosity and temperature of the polymer melt, (2) the thinner cross- section of the gate freezes more rapidly to seal off the cavity; and (3) parts can be more easily broken off the runner at the gate."
What are the advantages of a three-plate mold over a two- plate mold in injection molding?,"Answer. As the mold opens, the three-plate mold automatically separates the molded part(s) from the runner system."
Discuss some of the defects that can occur in plastic injection molding.,"Answer. The defects include: short shots, in which the polymer melt solidifies before filling the cavity; flashing, in which the polymer melt is squeezed into the parting surfaces between the mold halves and around ejection pins; sink marks, in which the surface is drawn into the molding by contraction of internal material; and weld lines where the melt has flowed around a core or"
Describe structural foam molding.,Answer. Structural foam molding is an injection molding process in which a gas or gas-producing ingredient is mixed with the polymer melt prior to injection into the mold cavity; this results in the part having a tough outer skin surrounded by a foam core.
What are the significant differences in the equipment and operating procedures between injection molding of thermoplastics and injection molding of thermosets?,"Answer. The differences in injection molding of thermosets are: (1) shorter barrel length, (2) lower temperatures in the barrel, these first two reasons to prevent premature curing; and (3) use of a heated mold to cause cross-linking of the TS polymer."
What is reaction injection molding?,Answer. Reaction injection molding involves the mixing of two highly reactive liquid ingredients and immediately injecting the mixture into a mold cavity where chemical reactions leading to solidification occur. The two ingredients form the components used in catalyst-activated or mixing-activated thermoset systems (Section 8.3.1).
What kinds of products are produced by blow molding?,"Answer. Blow molding is used to produce hollow, seamless containers, such as bottles."
What is the starting material form in thermoforming?,Answer. Thermoforming starts with a thermoplastic sheet or film.
What is the difference between a positive mold and a negative mold in thermoforming?,Answer. A positive mold has a convex shape; a negative mold has a concave cavity.
Why are the molds generally more costly in mechanical thermoforming than in pressure or vacuum thermoforming?,"Answer. In mechanical thermoforming, matching mold halves are required; while in other thermoforming processes, only one mold form is required."
What are the processes by which polymer foams are produced?,"Answer. There are several foaming processes: (1) mechanical agitation - mixing a liquid resin with air by, then hardening the polymer by means of heat or chemical reaction; (2) mixing a physical blowing agent with the polymer - a gas such as nitrogen (N2) or pentane (C5H12) which can be dissolved in the polymer melt under pressure, so that the gas comes out of solution and expands when the pressure is subsequently reduced; and (3) mixing the polymer with chemical compounds, called chemical blowing agents, that decompose at elevated temperatures to liberate gases such as CO2 or N2 within the melt."
What are some of the general considerations that product designers must keep in mind when designing components out of plastics?,"Answer. Some of the general considerations are : (1) Plastics are not as strong or stiff as metals and should not be used in applications where high stresses will be encountered. (2) Impact resistance of plastics is general good, better than many ceramics. (3) Service temperatures of plastics are limited relative to engineering metals and ceramics. (4) Thermal expansion is greater for plastics than metals; so dimensional changes due to temperature variations are much more significant than for metals. (5) Many types of plastics degrade from sunlight and certain other forms of radiation. Also, some plastics degrade in oxygen and ozone atmospheres. Finally, plastics are soluble in many common solvents."
"The problem in a certain thermoforming operation is that there is too much thinning in the walls of the large cup- shaped part. The operation is conventional pressure thermoforming using a positive mold, and the plastic is an ABS sheet with an initial thickness of 3.2 mm. (a) Why is thinning occurring in the walls of the cup? (b) What changes could be made in the operation to correct the problem?","Answer. (a) As the starting flat sheet is draped over the convex cup-shaped mold, the portion contacting the base of the cup experiences little stretching. However, the remaining portions of the sheet must be stretched significantly to conform to the sides of the cup. Hence, thinning in these sides results. (b)	The problem could be solved by either: (1) fabricating a negative mold to replace the current positive mold, since a negative mold will distribute the material more uniformly and result in approximately equal thinning throughout the sheet; or (2) prestretch the sheet as in Figure 13.38 in the text."

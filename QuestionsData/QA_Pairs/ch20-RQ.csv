Question,Answer
Identify the three basic types of sheet metalworking operations.,"Answer. The three operations are: (1) cutting, (2) bending, and (3) drawing."
"In blanking of a round sheet metal part, indicate how the clearance should be applied to the punch and die diameters.","Answer. For a blanking operation, die size = blank size, and the punch is smaller by twice the clearance."
What is the difference between a cutoff operation and a parting operation?,Answer. A cutoff operation separates parts from a strip by shearing one edge of each part in sequence. A parting operation cuts a slug between adjacent parts in the strip.
Describe V-bending and edge bending.,"Answer. In V-bending, a simple punch and die which have the included angle are used to bend the part. In edge bending, the punch force a cantilevered sheet metal section over a die edge to obtain the desired bend angle."
What is springback in sheet metal bending?,"Answer. Springback is the elastic recovery of the sheet metal after bending; it is usually measured as the difference between the final included angle of the bent part and the angle of the tooling used to make the bend, divided by the angle of the tooling."
What are some of the simple measures used to assess the feasibility of a proposed cup drawing operation?,"Answer. Measures of drawing feasibility include: (1) drawing ratio, DR = D/Dp; (2) reduction, r = (D - Dp)/D; and (3) thickness-to-diameter ratio, t/D; where t = stock thickness, D = blank diameter, and Dp = punch diameter."
Distinguish between redrawing and reverse drawing.,"Answer. In redrawing, the shape change is significant enough (e.g., drawing ratio greater than 2.0) that it must be carried out in two drawing steps, probably with annealing between the steps. In reverse drawing, two draws are accomplished on the part, one in one direction, the second in the opposite direction."
What are some of the possible defects in drawn sheet metal parts?,"Answer. Drawing defects include: (1) wrinkling, (2) tearing, (3) earing, and (4) surface scratches."
What is stretch forming?,Answer. Stretch forming of sheet metal involves stretching and simultaneous bending of the workpart to achieve shape change.
What are the two basic categories of structural frames used in stamping presses?,"Answer. Two press frame types are: (1) gap frame, also called C-frame, and (2) straight-sided frame."
What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of mechanical versus hydraulic presses in sheet metalworking?,Answer. Advantage of mechanical presses: faster cycle rates. Advantages of hydraulic presses: longer ram strokes and uniform force throughout stroke.
What is the Guerin process?,Answer. The Guerin process is a sheet metal forming process that uses a rubber die which flexes to force the sheet metal to take the shape of a form block (punch).
Identify a major technical problem in tube bending?,Answer. A major technical problem in tube bending is collapse of the tube walls during the process.
Distinguish between roll bending and roll forming.,Answer. Roll bending involves the forming of large sheet and plate metal sections into curved forms. Roll forming involves feeding a lone strip or coil through rotating rolls so that the shape of the rolls is imparted to the strip.
"The foreman in the pressworking section comes to you with the problem of a blanking operation that is producing parts with excessive burrs. What are the possible reasons for the burrs, and what can be done to correct the condition?","Answer. Reasons for excessive burrs: (1) clearance between punch and die is too large for the material and stock thickness. (2) Punch and die cutting edges are worn (rounded) which has the same effect as excessive clearance. To correct the problem: (1) Check the punch and die cutting edges to see if they are worn. If they are, regrind the faces to sharpen the cutting edges. (2) If the die is not worn, measure the punch and die clearance to see if it equals the recommended value. If not, die maker must rebuild the punch and die."
"The foreman in the drawing section of the shop brings to you several samples of parts that have been drawn in the shop. The samples have various defects. One has ears, another has wrinkles, and still a third has torn sections at its base. What are the causes of each of these defects and what remedies would you propose?",Answer. (1) Ears are caused by sheet metal that has directional properties. The material is anisotropic. One remedy is to anneal the metal to reduce the directionality of the properties. (2)	Wrinkles are caused by compressive buckling of the flange as it is drawn inward to form the cup. There are several possible remedies: (a) increase the t/D ratio by using a thicker gage sheet metal. This may not be possible since a design change is required. (b) Increase the blankholder pressure against the work during drawing. (3)	Tearing occurs due to high tensile stresses in the walls of the cup near the base. A remedy would be to provide a large punch radius. Tearing can also occur due to a die corner radius that is too small.
"A 75 mm diameter tube is bent into a rather complex shape with a series of simple tube bending operations. The wall thickness on the tube = 4.75 mm. The tubes will be used to deliver fluids in a chemical plant. In one of the bends where the bend radius is 125 mm, the walls of the tube are flattening badly. What can be done to correct the condition?",Answer. Possible solutions: (1) Use a mandrel to prevent collapsing of tube wall. (2) Request the designer to increase the bend radius to 3D = 225 mm. (3) Pack sand into the tube. The sand will act as an internal flexible mandrel to support the tube wall.

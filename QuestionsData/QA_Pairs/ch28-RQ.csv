Question,Answer
What are some of the important reasons why manufactured parts must be cleaned?,"Answer. The reasons include: (1) to prepare the surface for subsequent industrial processing, (2) to improve hygiene conditions, (3) to remove contaminants which might chemically react with the surface; and (4) to enhance product appearance and performance."
Mechanical surface treatments are often performed for reasons other than or in addition to cleaning. What are the reasons?,"Answer. Reasons for mechanical surface treatments include: deburring, improving smoothness, adding luster, and enhancing surface properties."
What are the basic types of contaminants that must be cleaned from metallic surfaces in manufacturing?,"Answer. Basic contaminant types are: (1) oil and grease, (2) solid particles, such as metal chips, abrasive grits, shop dirt, and dust, (3) buffing and polishing compounds, and (4) oxide films, rust, and scale."
Identify some of the mechanical cleaning methods.,"Answer. Mechanical cleaning methods include: belt grinding, honing, lapping, polishing, buffing, and mass finishing (such as barrel tumbling). These method also accomplish other functions such as deburring and surface finish improvement."
"In addition to surface cleaning, what is the main function performed by shot peening?",Answer. Shot peening is primarily used to improve the fatigue strength of metals by introducing cold working the metallic surface.
Name some of the important chemical cleaning methods.,"Answer. The chemical cleaning methods can be categorized as follows: (1) alkaline cleaning, (2) emulsion cleaning, (3) solvent cleaning, (4) acid cleaning and pickling, and (5) ultrasonic cleaning."
What is meant by the term mass finishing?,"Answer. In mass finishing, parts are mechanically cleaned and deburred in bulk, usually in a barrel by the mixing action of an abrasive media."
What is the difference between diffusion and ion implantation?,"Answer. Diffusion coating is a diffusion process in which atoms or molecules move across a boundary between two contacting materials. Ion implantation produces a similar result, but the process involves penetration of high- velocity ions into the surface of a substrate material."
What is calorizing?,"Answer. Calorizing is the diffusion of aluminum into carbon steel, alloy steels, and the alloys of nickel and cobalt. The process is also known as aluminizing."

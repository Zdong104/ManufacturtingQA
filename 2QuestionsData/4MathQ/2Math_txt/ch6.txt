6.2 For the preceding problem, use the inverse lever rule to determine the proportions of liquid and solid phases present in the alloy. 
Solution: From Fig 6.2, measured values of CL and CS are: CL = 5 mm, CS = 12 mm. Liquid phase proportion = 12/(12 + 5) = 12/17 = 0.71 Solid phase proportion = 5/17 = 0.29 
6.3 Using the lead-tin phase diagram in Figure 6.3, determine the liquid and solid phase compositions for a nominal composition of 40% Sn and 60% Pb at 204C (400F). 
Solution: From Fig 6.3, the compositions are observed as follows: Liquid phase composition = 56% Sn -44% Pb. D phase composition = 18% Sn -82% Pb. 
6.4 For the preceding problem, use the inverse lever rule to determine the proportions of liquid and solid phases present in the alloy. 
Solution: From Fig 6.3, measured values of CL and CS are: CL = 10.5 mm, CS = 15 mm. Liquid phase proportion = 15/(15 + 10.5) = 15/25.5 = 0.59 D phase proportion = 10.5/25.5 = 0.41 
6.5 Using the lead-tin phase diagram in Figure 6.3, determine the liquid and solid phase compositions for a nominal composition of 90% Sn and 10% Pb at 204C (400F). 
Solution: From Fig 6.3, the compositions are observed as follows: Liquid phase composition = 78% Sn -22% Pb. E phase composition = 98% Sn -2% Pb. 
6.6 For the preceding problem, use the inverse lever rule to determine the proportions of liquid and solid phases present in the alloy. 
Solution: From Fig 6.3, measured values of CL and CS are: CL = 7.8 mm, CS = 4.2 mm. Liquid phase proportion = 4.2/(13) = 0.32 D phase proportion = 7.8/13 = 0.68 
6.7 In the iron-iron carbide phase diagram of Figure 6.4, identify the phase or phases present at the following temperatures and nominal compositions: (a) 650C (1200F) and 2% Fe3C, (b) 760C (1400F) and 2% Fe3C, and (c) 1095C (2000F) and 1% Fe3C. 
Solution: (a) Alpha + iron carbide, (b) gamma + iron carbide, and (c) gamma.

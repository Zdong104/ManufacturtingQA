Process Capability and Tolerances 

42.1 An automatic turning process is set up to produce parts with a mean diameter = 6.255 cm. The process is in statistical control and the output is normally distributed with a standard deviation = 0.004 cm. Determine the process capability. 

Solution: Process capability PC = r 3V = 6.255 r 3(0.004) = 6.255 r 0.012 cm The upper and lower limits of the process capability range are: 6.243 to 6.267 cm 

42.2 * In Problem 42.1, the design specification on the part is: diameter = 6.250 0.013 cm. (a) What proportion of parts fall outside the tolerance limits? (b) If the process were adjusted so that its mean diameter = 6.250 cm and the standard deviation remained the same, what proportion of parts would fall outside the tolerance limits? 
Solution: (a) Given process mean P = 6.255 cm and V = 0.004 cm and tolerance limits 2.237 to 
2.263. On the lower side of the tolerance limit, using the standard normal distribution, z = (6.237 -6.255)/0.004 = -4.50. Conclusion: there are virtually no defects on the lower side of the tolerance. On the upper side of the tolerance limit, z = (6.263 -2.255)/0.004 = +2.00 Using tables of the standard normal distribution, Pr(z > 2.00) = 0.0227 The proportion of defects with the current process mean = 0.0227 = 2.27%. 
(b) Given process mean P = 6.250 cm and V = 0.004 cm and tolerance limits 6.237 to 6.263. On the lower side of the tolerance limit, z = (6.237 -6.250)/0.004 = -3.25. Using tables of the standard normal distribution, Pr(z < -3.25) = 0.0006. On the upper side of the tolerance limit, z = (6.263 6.250)/0.004 = +3.25. Using tables of the standard normal distribution, Pr(z > 3.25) = 0.0006 The proportion of defects with the current process mean = 0.0006 + 0.0006 = 0.0012 = 0.12%. 

42.3 A sheet-metal bending operation produces bent parts with an included angle = 92.1. The process is in statistical control and the values of included angle are normally distributed with a standard deviation = 0.23. The design specification on the angle = 90 r 2. (a) Determine the process capability. (b) If the process could be adjusted so that its mean = 90.0, determine the value of the process capability index. 
Solution: (a) PC = 92.1 r 3(0.23) = 92.1r 0.69. The upper and lower limits of the process capability range are: 91.41q to 92.79. 
(b) If P = 90q T = 92q -88q = 4q PCI = 4/(6 x 0.23) = 2.9 o virtually no defects. 

42.4 A plastic extrusion process produces round extrudate with a mean diameter = 28.6 mm. The process is in statistical control and the output is normally distributed with standard deviation = 0.53 mm. Determine the process capability. 
Solution: Process capability PC = r 3V = 28.6 r 3(0.53) = 28.6 r 1.59 mm The upper and lower limits of the process capability range are: 27.01 to 30.19 mm. 

42.5 In Problem 42.4, the design specification on the diameter is 28.0 r 2.0 mm. (a) What proportion of parts fall outside the tolerance limits? (b) If the process were adjusted so that its mean diameter = 
28.0 mm and the standard deviation remained the same, what proportion of parts would fall outside the tolerance limits? (c) With the adjusted mean at 28.0 mm, determine the value of the process capability index. 
Solution: (a) Given process mean P = 28.6 mm and V = 0.53 mm and tolerance limits 26.0 to 30.0 mm. On the lower side of the tolerance limit, using the standard normal distribution, z = (26.0 -28.6)/0.53 = -4.01. Conclusion: there are virtually no defects on the lower side of the tolerance. On the upper side of the tolerance limit, z = (30.0 -28.6)/0.53 = +2.64 Using tables of the standard normal distribution, Pr(z > 2.64) = 0.0041 The proportion of defects with the current process mean = 0.0041 = 0.41%. 
(b) Given process mean P = 28.0 mm and V = 0.53 mm and tolerance limits 26.0 to 30.0 mm. On the lower side of the tolerance limit, z = (26.0 -28.0)/0.53 = -3.77. Using tables of the standard normal distribution, Pr(z < -3.77) = approx. 0.0001 On the upper side of the tolerance limit, z = (30.0 -28.0)/0.53 = +3.77 Using tables of the standard normal distribution, Pr(z > 3.77) = approx. 0.0001 The proportion of defects with the current process mean = 0.0001 + 0.0001 = 0.0002 = 0.02%. 

(c) Process capability index PCI = 4.0/(6 x 0.53) = 1.258

(a) x chart: x = 9.20 mm = CL LCL = x -A2 R = 9.20 -0.373(0.24) = 9.1105 mm. UCL = x + A2 R = 9.20 + 0.373(0.24) = 9.2895 mm.

(b) Student exercise. 
42.9 Seven samples of 5 parts each have been collected from an extrusion process that is in statistical 
control, and the diameter of the extrudate has been measured for each part. The calculated values of x for each sample are (inch) 1.002, 0.999, 0.995, 1.004, 0.996, 0.998, and 1.006. The values of R are (inch) 0.010, 0.011, 0.014, 0.020, 0.008, 0.013, and 0.017, respectively. (a) Determine the

42.10 A p chart is to be constructed. Six samples of 25 parts each have been collected, and the average number of defects per sample was 2.75. Determine the center, LCL and UCL for the p chart. 
Solution: p = 2.75/25 = 0.11 = CL LCL = p -3 
p(1 &#16; p)/ n = 0.11 -3 
0.11(0.89) / 25 = 0.11 -3(0.0626) = -0.078 o 0 UCL = p + 3 
p(1 &#16; p)/ n = 0.11 + 3 
0.11(0.89) / 25 = 0.11 + 3(0.0626) = 0.298 
42.11 Ten samples of equal size are taken to prepare a p chart. The total number of parts in these ten samples was 900 and the total number of defects counted was 117. Determine the center, LCL and UCL for the p chart.

Solution: p = 0.5(UCL + LCL) = 0.5(.24 + .10) = 0.17 
UCL -LCL =0.24 -0.10 =0.14 =6 
p(1 &#16; p)/ n = 6

Quality Programs 
42.16 A foundry that casts turbine blades inspects for eight features that are considered critical-toquality. During the previous month, 1,236 castings were produced. During inspection, 47 defects among the eight features were found, and 29 castings had one or more defects. Determine DPMO, DPM, and DUPM in a Six Sigma program for these data and convert each to its corresponding sigma level. 
Solution: Summarizing the data, Nu = 1236, No = 8, Nd = 47, and Ndu = 29. Thus, 47
DPMO 1 000 000,, 4753 
1236 8 The corresponding sigma level is about 4.1 from Table 42.3. 47
1 000 000, 38 026,
DPM , 
1236 The corresponding sigma level is about 3.3. 29
1 000 000, 23 463,
DUPM , 
1236 The corresponding sigma level is about 3.4. 
42.17 In the previous problem, if the foundry desired to improve its quality performance to the 5.0 sigma level in all three measures of DPM, how many defects and defective units would they produce in an annual production quantity of 15,000 castings? Assume the same eight features are used to assess quality. 
Solution: Summarizing the data, Nu = 15,00, No = 8, and Nd and Ndu are unknown. To achieve a 
5.0 sigma level, they would produce 233 dpm. Thus, for defects per million opportunities, 
Nd
DPMO 1 000 000,, 233 
15000 8 Rearranging, Nd = 233(15,000)(8)/1,000,000 = 27.96, rounded up to 28 defects in 15,000 total castings. Similarly, if the 5.0 sigma criterion were used for defects per million units, 
Nd
DPM 1 000 000,, 233 
15000 Rearranging, Nd = 233(15,000)/1,000,000 = 3.495 defects in 15,000 total castings. Finally, if the 5.0 sigma criterion were used for defective units per million units, 
Ndu
DUPM 1 000 000,, 233 
15000 Ndu = 233(15,000)/1,000,000 = 3.495 defective units in 15,000 total castings. 
42.18 The inspection department in an automobile final assembly plant inspects cars coming off the production line against 55 quality features considered important to customer satisfaction. The department counts the number of defects found per 100 cars, which is the same type of metric used by a national consumer advocate agency. During a one-month period, a total of 16,582 cars rolled off the assembly line. These cars included a total of 6045 defects of the 55 features, which translates to 36.5 defects per 100 cars. In addition, a total of 1955 cars had one or more of the defects during this month. Determine DPMO, DPM, and DUPM in a Six Sigma program for these data and convert each to its corresponding sigma level. 
Solution: Although the inspection department uses number of defects per 100 cars, a Six Sigma program uses defects per million as its metric. Summarizing the data, Nu = 16,582, No = 55, Nd = 6045, and Ndu = 1955. Thus, 
6045
DPMO 1 000 000,, 6628 
16582 55 The corresponding sigma level is about 4.0 from Table 42.3. 6045

16582 The corresponding sigma level is about 1.8. 1955

16582 The corresponding sigma level is about 2.7. 
42.19 A company produces a certain part whose most important dimension is 37.50 0.025 in. If the tolerance is exceeded, the customer will return the part to the manufacturer at a cost of $200 in rework and replacement expenses. (a) Determine the constant k in the Taguchi loss function, Eq. (42.13). (b) The company can add a finish grinding operation that will allow the tolerance to be reduced to 0.010 in. Using the loss function from part (a) what is the value of the loss associated with this new tolerance? 
Solution: (a) In Eq. (42.13), the value of (x â€“ N) is the tolerance 0.025 in. The loss is the expected cost of rework and replacement, which is $200. Using this cost in the loss function, the value of k can be determined as follows: 
200 = k(0.025)2 = 0.000625k 
k = 200/0.000625 = $320,000 
Solutions for Fundamentals of Modern Manufacturing, 4/e (published by Wiley) ï›™ MPGroover 2010 10-23-08 Accordingly, the Taguchi loss function is L(x) = 320,000(x â€“ N). 
(b) The value of the loss for a tolerance of 0.010 is L(x) = 320,000(0.010)2 = $32.00 
42.20 The additional operation in the preceding problem will add $2.00 to the current cost of the part, which is $13.50. If the rate of returns from the customer at the tolerance of 0.025 in is 2.1%, and it is expected to drop to zero returns using the new tolerance, should the company add the finish grinding operation to the manufacturing sequence for the part? Answer this question using the basic cost and return rate data without consideration of the Taguchi loss function. 
Solution: The basic cost and return rate data are that 2.1% of the parts are returned, and it costs $200 for each one that is returned. Comparing the cost per part with and without the grinding operation, we have 
Without the grinding operation, cost/pc = $13.50 + 0.021($200) = 13.50 + 4.20 = $17.70 
With the added operation, cost/pc = 13.50 + 2.00 = $15.50 
The calculation favors the addition of the grinding operation.

Determine (a) the distance between the laser and the photodetector when no part is present and (b) the height of a part when the distance between the laser and photo-detector is 12.0250 in. 
Solution: (a) L with no part when D = 0: D=H â€“ L cot A; 0 = H â€“ L cot A; L = H/cot A = H tan A L = 24.0000 tan(35) = 16.8050 in 
(b) D = H â€“ L cot A = 24.0000 â€“ 12.0250 cot(35) D = 24.0000 â€“ 12.0250(1.42815) = 6.8265 in 
42.22 A laser triangulation system is used to determine the height of a steel block. The system has a photosensitive detector that is located 750.000 mm above the working surface and the laser is mounted at a 30.00Â° angle from the vertical. With no part on the worktable, the position of the laser reflection on the photo sensor is recorded. After a part is placed on the worktable, the laser reflection shifts 70.000 mm toward the laser. Determine the height of the object. 
Solution: Need to find the distance of the reflection from the laser. L with no part when D=0: D = H â€“ L cot A; 0 = H â€“ L cot A; L = H/cot A = H tan A L = 750 tan(30) = 433.0127 mm L with part = 433.0127 â€“ 70 = 363.0127 mm D = H â€“ L cot A = 750 â€“ 363.0127 cot(30) = 750 â€“ 363.0127(1.732) = 121.262 mm

Open-Loop Positioning Systems 
38.1 A leadscrew with a 7.5 mm pitch drives a worktable in an NC positioning system. The leadscrew is powered by a stepping motor which has 200 step angles. The worktable is programmed to move a distance of 120 mm from its present position at a travel speed of 300 mm/min. Determine (a) the number of pulses required to move the table the specified distance and (b) the required motor speed and pulse rate to achieve the desired table speed. 
Solution: (a) D = 360/ns = 360/200 = 1.8q np = 360x/pD = 360(120)/(7.5 x 1.8) = 3200 pulses 
(b) Nm = vt/p = (300 mm/min)/(7.5 mm/rev) = 40 rev/min fp = vtns/60p = 300(200)/(60 x 7.5) = 133.33 Hz 
38.2 Referring to Problem 38.1, the mechanical inaccuracies in the open-loop positioning system can be described by a normal distribution whose standard deviation = 0.005 mm. The range of the worktable axis is 500 mm, and there are 12 bits in the binary register used by the digital controller to store the programmed position. For the positioning system, determine (a) control resolution, (b) accuracy, and (c) repeatability. (d) What is the minimum number of bits that the binary register should have so that the mechanical drive system becomes the limiting component on control resolution? 
Solution: (a) CR1= p/ns = 7.5 mm/200 = 0.0375 mm. CR2= L/2B = 500/212 – 1 = 500/4095 = 0.122 mm. CR = Max{CR1, CR2} = Max{0.0375, 0.122} = 0.122 mm. 
(b) 
Accuracy = 0.5 CR + 3V = 0.5(0.122) + 3(0.005) = 0.076 mm. 

(c) 
Repeatability = r 3V = r 3(0.005) = r 0.015 mm. 

(d) 
In order for the mechanical errors to be the limiting factor in control resolution in this problem, set CR1= CR2. Thus, 0.0375 = 500/(2B –1) 2B – 1 = 500/0.0375 = 13,333.33 2B = = 13,334.33 B ln 2 = ln 13,334.33 0.69315 B = 9.498 B = 13.703 Use B = 14 bits

(b) Determine the minimum number of bits required in the binary register of the robot's control memory to achieve the specified accuracy. 
Solution: (a) Repeatability = r 3V = r 0.030. 


0.030q = 2(0.030)/360 = 0.0005236 rad. 
End-of-link movement = L A where A = angle of movement in radians 
L A = 25(0.0005236) = 0.0131 in 
Accuracy = 0.5 CR + 3V = 0.5 CR + 0.0131 
Specified accuracy = 0.030 
0.030 = 0.5 CR + 0.0131 0.5 CR = 0.030 -0.0131 = 0.0169 CR = 0.0169/0.5 = 0.0338 in Since CR is positive, the specified accuracy should be possible to achieve. 
(b) Given CR = 0.0338 from part (a), total range = 75q Converting this to an arc distance, range = (2(75)/360) x 25 = 32.725 in CR = L/(2B – 1) = 0.0338 32.725/(2B – 1) = 0.0338 2B – 1 = 32.725/0.0338 = 968.2 2B = 969.2 B ln 2 = ln 969.2 0.6931 B = 6.876 B = 9.92 o 10 bits

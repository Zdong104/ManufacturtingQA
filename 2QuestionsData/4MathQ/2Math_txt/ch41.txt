Problems Inventory Control 41.1 A product is made to stock. Annual demand is 86,000 units. Each unit costs $9.50 and the annual holding cost rate is 22%. Setup cost to produce this product is $800. Determine (a) economic order quantity and (b) total inventory costs for this situation. Solution: (a) EOQ = (2DaCsu/Ch)0.5 = (2 x 86,000 x 800/(0.22 x 9.50))0.5 = 8114 units (b) TIC = ChQ/2 + CsuDa/Q = 0.22(9.50)(8114/2) + 800(86,000/8114) = 8479 + 8479 = $16,958 41.2 Given that annual demand for a product is 20,000 units, cost per unit = $6.00, holding cost rate = 2.5%/month, changeover (setup) time between products averages 2.0 hr, and downtime cost during changeover = $200/hr, determine (a) economic order quantity and (b) total inventory costs for this situation. Solution: (a) EOQ = (2DaCsu/Ch)0.5 = (2 x 20,000 x 2 x 200/(12 x .025 x 6.00))0.5 = 2981 units (b) TIC = ChQ/2 + CsuDa/Q = 12 x 0.025(6.00)(2981/2) + 2 x 200(20,000/2981) = 2683 + 2684 = $5367 41.3 A product is produced in batches. Batch size = 2000 units. Annual demand = 50,000 units, and unit cost of the product = $4.00. Setup time to run a batch = 2.5 hr, cost of downtime on the affected equipment is figured at $250/hr, and annual holding cost rate = 30%. What would the annual savings be if the product were produced in the economic order quantity? Solution: Current TIC = ChQ/2 + CsuDa/Q = 0.30(4.00)(2000/2) + 2.5 x 250(50,000/2000) = 1200 + 15,625 = $16,825 EOQ = (2DaCsu/Ch)0.5 = (2 x 50,000 x 2.5 x 250/(0.30 x 4.00))0.5 = 7217 units TIC at EOQ = ChQ/2 + CsuDa/Q = 0.30(4.00)(7217/2) + 2.5 x 250(50,000/7217) = 4330 + 4330 = $8660 Savings = 16,825 -8660 = $8165 41.4 Assembly of a product requires that a component part be ordered and stocked. Demand for the product is constant throughout the year at 7800 units annually. The cost to place an order is $95. The cost of the part is $56 and the holding cost rate is 22%. When units are ordered, they take two weeks to arrive. Determine (a) the economic order quantity and (b) the reorder point. (c) The parts are prepackaged in multiples of 100. It saves the supplier unpacking and repackaging time if they can ship in multiples of 100. The supplier has offered to reduce the price by $1 per unit if even multiples of 100 are purchased. How much would be saved (if anything) by taking this offer? Solution: (a) EOQ = (2DaCsu/Ch)0.5 = (2 x 7800 x 95/(0.22 x 56))0.5 = 346.83 = 347 units (b) Weekly demand is 7800/52 = 150 units/wk. If it takes 2 weeks for an order to arrive, you must reorder when the supply reaches 2*150 = 300 units (c) Since total cost is not a linear function, you must check the cost both above and below the EOQ. Also, since the item cost is lower, you must calculate total cost instead of total inventory cost. TCEOQ = DaCp + ChQ/2 + CsuDa/Q = 7800(56) + (56)(0.22)(347)/2 + 95(7800)/347 TCEOQ = 436,800 + 2137.52 + 2134.45 = $ 441,073 TC300 = 7800(55) + (55)(0.22)(300)/2 + 95(7800)/300 = 429000 + 1815 + 2470 = $ 433,285 TC400 = 7800(55) + (55)(0.22)(400)/2 + 95(7800)/400 = 429000 + 2420 + 1852.50 = $ 433,273 It is cheapest to buy 400 units at a time. That will save $7800 per year Solutions for Fundamentals of Modern Manufacturing, 4/e (published by Wiley)  MPGroover 2010 01-22-09, 01-27-09 41.5 A certain piece of production equipment is used to produce various components for an assembled product. To keep in-process inventories low, it is desired to produce the components in batch sizes of 150 units. Demand for each product is 2500 units per year. Production downtime costs an estimated $200/hr. All of the components made on the equipment are of approximately equal unit cost, which is $9.00. Holding cost rate = 30%/yr. In how many minutes must the changeover between batches be completed in order for 150 units to be the economic order quantity? Solution: EOQ = (2DaCsu/Ch)0.5 (EOQ)2= 2DaCdtTsu/hCp Tsu = hCp(EOQ)2/2Da Cdt = 0.3(9.00)(150)2/(2 x 2500 x 200) = 0.06075 hr = 3.65 min. 41.6 Current setup time on a certain machine is 3.0 hr. Cost of downtime on this machine is estimated at $200/hr. Annual holding cost per part made on the equipment, Ch = $1.00. Annual demand for the part is 15,000 units. Determine (a) EOQ and (b) total inventory costs for this data. Also, determine (c) EOQ and (d) total inventory costs, if the changeover time could be reduced to six minutes. Solution: (a) EOQ = (2DaCsu/Ch)0.5 = (2 x 15,000 x 3.00 x 200/1.00)0.5 = 4243 pc (b) TIC = ChQ/2 + CsuDa/Q = 1.00(4243/2) + 3.00 x 200(15,000/4243) = 2121.50 + 2121.14 = $4242.64 (c) If Tsu = 6 min = 0.1 hr, Csu = CdtTsu = 200(0.1) = $20. EOQ = (2 x 15,000 x 20/1.00)0.5 = 775 pc (d) TIC = 1.00(775/2) + 20(15,000/775) = 387.50 + 387.10 = $774.60 41.7 The two-bin approach is used to control inventory for a particular low-cost component. Each bin holds 1200 units. The annual usage of the component is 45,000 units. Cost to order the component is around $70. (a) What is the imputed holding cost per unit for this data? (b) If the actual annual holding cost per unit is only 7 cents, what lot size should be ordered? (c) How much more is the current two-bin approach costing the company annually, compared to the economic order quantity? Solution: (a) EOQ = (2DaCsu/Ch)0.5 1200 = (2 x 45,000 x 70/Ch)0.5 Ch = 2 x 45,000 x 70/12002 = $4.38 annually (b) Given Ch = $0.07, EOQ = (2 x 45,000 x 70/0.07)0.5 = 9486.83 o 9487 pc (c) For the two-bin approach in which Q = 1200, TIC = 0.07(1200/2) + 70(45,000/1200) = 42 + 2625 = $2667.00 For the EOQ = 9487, TIC = 0.07(9487/2) + 70(45,000/9487) = 332.05 + 332.03 = $664.08 Additional cost = 2667.00 – 664.08 = $2002.92 Material Requirements Planning 41.8 Quantity requirements are to be planned for component C2 in product P1. Required deliveries for P1 are given in Table 41.1. Ordering, manufacturing, and assembly lead times are as follows: for P1 and C2, the lead time is one week; and for S1 and M2, the lead time is two weeks. Given the product structure in Figure 41.4, determine the time-phased requirements for M2, C2, and S1 to meet the master schedule for P1. Assume no common use items and all on-hand inventories and scheduled receipts are zero. Use a format similar to Table 41.2 and develop a spreadsheet calculator to solve.

Given the product structure in Figure 41.4, determine the time-phased requirements for M5, C5, and S2 to meet the master schedule for P1. Assume no common use items. On-hand inventories are 200 units for M5 and 100 units for C5, zero for S2. Use a format similar to Table 41.2 and develop a spreadsheet calculator to solve.

For product 1, demand = 750/wk, setup time = 6 hr, and operation time = 4.0 min. For product 2, demand = 900/wk, setup time = 5 hr, and operation time = 3.0 min. For product 3, demand = 400/wk, setup time = 7 hr, and operation time = 2.0 min. For product 4, demand = 400/wk, setup time = 6 hr, and operation time = 3.0 min. The plant normally operates one shift (7.0 hours per shift), five days per week and there are currently 3 work centers in the department. Propose a way of scheduling the machines to meet the weekly demand. Solution: Determine time to produce each product, assuming a single setup for each product: Product 1: Time per batch = 6.0 + 750(4/60) = 6 + 50 = 56 hr. Product 2: Time per batch = 5.0 + 900(3/60) = 5 + 45 = 50 hr Product 3: Time per batch = 7.0 + 400(2/60) = 7 + 13.333 = 20.333 hr Product 4: Time per batch = 6.0 + 400(3/60) = 6 + 20 = 26 hr Total hours for all four products = 56 + 50 + 20.333 + 26 = 152.333 hr. Available hours per week on 3 work centers if normal hours are assumed = 3 x (5 x 7) = 105 hr. This is fewer than the number of hours required. To meet the weekly production, overtime must be used. The following schedule is proposed: Work center I II III  Product 1 2 3 4  Quantity 750 900 400 400  Setup hours 6.0 5.0 7.0 6.0  Run hours 50.0 45.0 13.333 20.0  Hrs/product 56.0 50.0 20.333 26.0  Hrs/wk center 56.0 50.0 46.333  Totals  _____ 24.0  ______ 128.333  ______ 152.333  ______ 152.333  41.12 In the previous problem, propose a way of scheduling to meet the weekly demand if there were four machines instead of three. Solution: Time to produce each product is the same as given in the preceding solution, under the assumption that a single setup is required for each product. Available hours per week on 4 work centers if normal hours are assumed = 4 x (5 x 7) = 140 hr. This is fewer than the number of hours required. To meet the weekly production, overtime must be used. In order to equalize the workload among machines as much as possible, let us propose to produce products 1 and 3 on work centers 1 and 2 and Products 2 and 4 on work centers 3 and 4. In both cases, this will require an additional setup We want to equalize the workload on work centers I and II with Products 1 and 3.

C is read from the Y-intercept and is approximately 680 ft/min. The slope, n, can be determined by taking the ln of the x and y &#3; because the Taylor tool life equation is derived assuming the slope is negative.

The current cutting conditions (dry) yield Taylor tool life equation parameters of n = 0.25 and C = 1300 (ft/min). When a coolant is used in the operation, the cutting speed can be increased by 20% and still maintain the same tool life. Assuming n does not change with the addition of coolant, what is the resulting change in the value of C?","Solution: Find the present tool life T vTn = C; T = (C/v)(1/n) T = (1300/500)(1/.25) = 2.604.0 = 45.7 min After coolant, the new cutting speed would be 500(1+.20) = 600 If the tool life stays the same, C = vTn = 600(45.7).25 = 1560 % increase in C = (1560-1500)/1500 = 20% Note: When viewing the log-log plot of the Taylor tool life curve, it is a straight line. Since n, the slope, is not affected by the coolant, the coolant effectively raises the line on the graph. Raising the curve so that it increases the value of v by a certain percentage will increase C by the same percentage. This is true independent of the values of n and C."

It has been found that the use of a coolant type cutting fluid will allow an increase of 25 ft/min in the speed without any effect on tool life.

With cutting fluid, C = 200 + 25 = 225. Dry: at v = 125 ft/min, T = (200/125)1/.125 = (1.6)8 = 42.95 min With cutting fluid: at v = 125 ft/min, T = (225/125)1/.125 = (1.8)8 = 110.2 min Increase = (110.2 -42.95) = 67.25 min = 156.6%"
23,23.29,"23.29 A high speed steel 6.0 mm twist drill is being used in a production drilling operation on mild steel. A cutting oil is applied by the operator by brushing the lubricant onto the drill point and flutes prior to each hole. The cutting conditions are: speed = 25 m/min, and feed = 0.10 mm/rev, and hole depth = 40 mm. The foreman says that the ""speed and feed are right out of the handbook"" for this work material. Nevertheless, he says, ""the chips are clogging in the flutes, resulting in friction heat, and the drill bit is failing prematurely due to overheating."" What's the problem? What do you recommend to solve it?","Solution: There are several problems here. First, the depth-to-diameter ratio is 1.75:0.25 = 7:1, which is greater than the 4:1 which is usually recommended. As a consequence the chips produced in the hole are having difficulty exiting, thus causing overheating of the drill. Second, the manual method of applying the cutting oil may not be particularly effective. Third, with overheating as a problem, the cutting oil may not be removing heat from the operation effectively. Recommendation: The 7:1 depth-to-diameter ratio is a given, a requirement of the drilling operation, and we assume it cannot be changed. The twist drill might be operated in a peck-drilling mode to solve the chip clogging problem. Peck-drilling means drilling for a distance approximately equal to one drill diameter, then retract the drill, then drill some more, etc. A twist drill with a fluid hole could be used to more effectively deliver the cutting fluid to the drill point to help extract the chips. Finally, an emulsified oil might be tried in the operation, one with good lubricating qualities, as a substitute for the cutting oil. Since overheating is a problem, it makes sense to try a coolant."

The time to load and unload the part will be about as long as the machining time and the machine will be idle while that is happening. It would become a better choice if another part could be loaded and unloaded while the machining was taking place. Then the only delay would be bringing the new part into position.

(b) To correct the problem: (1) Check the punch and die cutting edges to see if they are worn. If they are, regrind the faces to sharpen the cutting edges. (2) If the die is not worn, measure the punch and die clearance to see if it equals the recommended value. If not, die maker must rebuild the punch and die. Bending"

(a) Determine the dimensions of the two equal sides that will result after the bend, if the bend radius = 3/16 in. For convenience, these sides should be measured to the beginning of the bend radius. (b) Also, determine the length of the part's neutral axis after the bend. (c) Where should the machine operator set the stop on the press brake relative to the starting length of the part?","Solution: (a) R/t = (3/16)/(5/32) = 1.2. Therefore, Kba = 0.33 Ab = 2(90/360)(0.1875 + 0.33 x 0.15625) = 0.3756 in Dimensions (lengths) of each end = 0.5(4.0 -0.3756) = 1.8122 in (b) Since the metal stretches during bending, its length will be greater after the bend than before. Its length before bending = 4.000 in. The stretched length of the bend along the neutral axis will be: Bent length = 2(90/360)(0.1875 + 0.5 x 0.15625) = 0.4173 in Therefore, the length of the neutral axis of the part will be 2(1.8122) + 0.4173 = 4.0417 in However, if stretching occurs along the neutral axis of the bend, then thinning of the stretched metal will also occur, and this will affect the preceding calculated value of the length of the bent section. The amount of thinning will be inversely proportional to the amount of stretching because volume must remain constant, before and after bending. The sheet thickness after bending (assuming uniform stretching and thinning) = (0.3756/0.4173)(0.15625) = 0.1406 in. Now let us recalculate the length of the bent section with this new value of t. The bend radius will remain the same (R = 3/16 = 0.1875 in) because it is located at the inside of the bend. Length of neutral axis along the bend = 2(90/360)(0.1875 + 0.5 x 0.1406) = 0.4049 in. The new final length of the neutral axis is L = 2(1.8122) + 0.4049 = 4.0293 in. The amount of stretching is less than previously determined, and so is the amount of thinning. An iterative procedure must be used to arrive at the final values of stretching and thinning. Recalculate the thickness of the stretched sheet as (0.3756/0.4049)(0.15625) = 0.1449 in, and recalculating the length of the bent section based on this value, we have the following: Length of neutral axis along the bend = 2(90/360)(0.1875 + 0.5 x 0.1449) = 0.4084 in The new final length of the neutral axis is L = 2(1.8122) + 0.4084 = 4.0328 in. One more iteration: The thickness of the stretched sheet is (0.3756/0.4084)(0.15625) = 0.1437 in, and recalculating the length of the bent section based on this value, we have 2(90/360)(0.1875 +"

The sheet is bent along the 25 mm direction, so that the bend is 25 mm long. The resulting sheet metal part has an acute angle of 30q and a bend radius of 6 mm. Determine (a) the bend allowance and (b) the length of the neutral axis of the part after the bend. (Hint: the length of the neutral axis before the bend = 100.0 mm).","Solution: (a) Given that ’ = 30, R = 6.0 mm, and t = 4.0 mm D = 180 -’ = 150. Ab = 2(/360)(R + Kbat) R/t = 6/4 = 1.5, which is less than 2.0; therefore, Kba = 0.333 Ab = 2(150/360)(6.0 + 0.333 x 4.0) = 19.195 mm (b) Due to stretching, the neutral axis of the final part will be greater than 100.0 mm. The amount of stretching will be the difference between the bend allowance and the length of the bent section, which is computed as 2(150/360)(6.0 + 0.5 x 4.0) = 20.944. The difference = 20.944 – 19.195 = 1.75 mm Thus, the final length of the neutral axis will be L = 100 + 1.75 = 101.75 mm However, if stretching occurs along the neutral axis of the bend, then thinning of the stretched metal will also occur, and this will affect the preceding calculated value of the length of the bent section. The amount of thinning will be inversely proportional to the amount of stretching because volume must remain constant, before and after bending. The sheet thickness after bending (assuming uniform stretching and thinning) = (19.195/20.944)(4.0) = 3.67 mm. Now let us recalculate the length of the bent section with this new value of t. The bend radius will remain the same (R = 6.0 mm) because it is located at the inside of the bend. Length of neutral axis along the bend = 2(150/360)(6.0 + 0.5 x 3.67) = 20.512 mm.

25,25.10,"25.10 It is desired to compare the cycle times required to grind a particular workpiece using traditional surface grinding and using creep feed grinding.

When traditional grinding is used, the infeed is set at 0.025 mm, and the wheel traverses twice (forward and back) across the work surface during each pass before resetting the infeed. There is no crossfeed since the wheel width is greater than the work width. Each pass is made at a workspeed of 12 m/min, but the wheel overshoots the part on both sides. With acceleration and deceleration, the wheel is engaged in the work for 50% of the time on each pass.

3,3.26,"3.26 One of the inspectors in the quality control department has frequently used the Brinell and Rockwell hardness tests, for which equipment is available in the company.

(a) Is he correct? (b) If not, what are some of the other principles involved in hardness testing, and what are the associated tests?","Solution: (a) No, the claim is not correct. Not all hardness tests are based on the applied load divided by area, but many of them are. (b) Some of the other hardness tests and operating principles include: (1) Rockwell hardness test, which measures the depth of indentation of a cone resulting from an applied load; (2) Scleroscope, which measures the rebound height of a hammer dropped from a certain distance against a surface specimen; and (3) Durometer, which measures elastic deformation by pressing an indentor into the surface of rubber and similar soft materials."
3,3.27,"3.27 A batch of annealed steel has just been received from the vendor. It is supposed to have a tensile strength in the range 60,000 -70,000 lb/in2.

(b) Estimate the yield strength of the material.","Solution: (a) TS = 500(HB) = 500(118) = 59,000 lb/in2. This lies outside the specified range of 60,000 to 70,000 lb/in2. However, from a legal standpoint, it is unlikely that the batch can be rejected on the basis of its measured Brinell hardness number without using an actual tensile test to measure TS. The formula for converting from Brinell hardness number to tensile strength is only an approximating equation.

Assume that the resistance of the wire is the primary factor that determines the current it can carry and the cross-sectional area and length are the same for the aluminum and copper wires.","Solution: The area and length are constant between the types of wires.

Thus, it should be possible to force the metal against the walls of the mold in centrifugal casting without the nuisance of “raining” inside the cavity. However, this all assumes that the metal is inside the mold and rotating with it. In the absence of gravity, there would be a problem in pouring the molten metal into the mold cavity and getting it to adhere to the mold wall as the mold begins to rotate.

11,11.16,"11.16 The housing for a certain machinery product is made of two components, both aluminum castings. The larger component has the shape of a dish sink, and the second component is a flat cover that is attached to the first component to create an enclosed space for the machinery parts. Sand casting is used to produce the two castings, both of which are plagued by defects in the form of misruns and cold shuts. The foreman complains that the parts are too thin, and that is the reason for the defects. However, it is known that the same components are cast successfully in other foundries. What other explanation can be given for the defects?","Solution: Misruns and cold shuts result from low fluidity. One possible reason for the defects in this case is that the thickness of the casting cross sections is too small. However, given that the casting of these parts is successfully accomplished at other foundries, two other possible explanations are (1) the pouring temperature is too low, and (2) the pouring operation is performed too slowly."

(2) Increase the packing of the mold sand to resist penetration. (3) Treat the mold cavity surface to make it harder. (b) What possible defects might result from each of these steps?

One has ears, another has wrinkles, and still a third has torn sections at its base. What are the causes of each of these defects and what remedies would you propose?",Solution: (1) Ears are caused by sheet metal that has directional properties. The material is anisotropic. One remedy is to anneal the metal to reduce the directionality of the properties. (2) Wrinkles are caused by compressive buckling of the flange as it is drawn inward to form the cup. There are several possible remedies: (a) increase the t/D ratio by using a thicker gage sheet metal. This may not be possible since a design change is required. (b) Increase the blankholder pressure against the work during drawing.  (3) Tearing occurs due to high tensile stresses in the walls of the cup near the base. A remedy would be to provide a large punch radius. Tearing can also occur due to a die corner radius that is too small.,326,729

The supplier has offered to reduce the price by $1 per unit if even multiples of 100 are purchased. How much would be saved (if anything) by taking this offer?","Solution: (a) EOQ = (2DaCsu/Ch)^0.5 = (2 x 7800 x 95/(0.22 x 56))^0.5 = 346.83 = 347 units (b) Weekly demand is 7800/52 = 150 units/wk. If it takes 2 weeks for an order to arrive, you must reorder when the supply reaches 2*150 = 300 units  (c) Since total cost is not a linear function, you must check the cost both above and below the EOQ. Also, since the item cost is lower, you must calculate total cost instead of total inventory cost.   TCEOQ = DaCp + ChQ/2 + CsuDa/Q = 7800(56) + (56)(0.22)(347)/2 + 95(7800)/347 TCEOQ = 436,800 + 2137.52 + 2134.45 = $ 441,073 TC300 = 7800(55) + (55)(0.22)(300)/2 + 95(7800)/300 = 429000 + 1815 + 2470 = $ 433,285 TC400 = 7800(55) + (55)(0.22)(400)/2 + 95(7800)/400 = 429000 + 2420 + 1852.50 = $ 433,273 It is cheapest to buy 400 units at a time.

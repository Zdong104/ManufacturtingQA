Question,Answer
"The maximum possible draft in a rolling operation depends on which of the following parameters (more than one)? (a) coefficient of friction between roll and work, (b) roll diameter, (c) roll velocity, (d) stock thickness, (e) strain, and (f) strength coefficient of the work metal.",Answer. (a) and (b).
"Which of the following rolling mill types are associated with relatively small diameter rolls in contact with the work (more than one)? (a) cluster mill, (b) continuous rolling mill, (c) four-high mill, (d) reversing mill, or (e) three-high configuration.",Answer. (a) and (c).
"Production of pipes and tubes is associated with which of the following bulk deformation processes (more than one)? (a) extrusion, (b) hobbing, (c) ring rolling, (d) roll forging, (e) roll piercing, (f) tube sinking, or (g) upsetting.","Answer. (a), (e), and (f)."
"Which of the four basic bulk deformation processes use compression to effect shape change (more than one)? (a) bar and wire drawing, (b) extrusion, (c) forging, and (d) rolling.","Answer. (a), (b), (c), and (d). Bar and wire drawing (a) is the only tricky answer; although tensile stresses are applied to the work, the work is squeezed through the die opening by compression - the term indirect compression is sometimes used."
Flash in impression die forging serves no useful purpose and is undesirable because it must be trimmed from the part after forming: (a) true or (b) false?,Answer. (b). Flash causes build-up of pressure inside the die which causes the work metal to fill the cavity.
"Which of the following are classified as forging operations (more than one)? (a) coining, (b) fullering, (c) impact extrusion, (d) roll forging, (e) thread rolling, and (f) upsetting.","Answer. (a), (b), (d), and (f)."
The production of tubing is possible in indirect extrusion but not in direct extrusion: (a) true or (b) false?,Answer. (b). Tube and pipe cross-sections can be produced by either direct or indirect extrusion.
"Theoretically, the maximum reduction possible in a wire drawing operation, under the assumptions of a perfectly plastic metal, no friction, and no redundant work, is which of the following (one answer)? (a) zero, (b) 0.63, (c) 1.0, or (d) 2.72.",Answer. (b)
"Which of the following bulk deformation processes are involved in the production of nails for lumber construction (more than one)? (a) bar and wire drawing, (b) extrusion, (c) forging, and (d) rolling.","Answer. (a), (c), and (d). Bar stock is rolled, drawn into wire stock, and upset forged to form the nail head."
"Johnson's formula is associated with which of the four bulk deformation processes (one answer)? (a) bar and wire drawing, (b) extrusion, (c) forging, and (d) rolling.",Answer. (b)
"Obtain a large common nail (flat head). Measure the head diameter and thickness, as well as the diameter of the nail shank. (a) What stock length must project out of the die in order to provide sufficient material to produce the nail? (b) Using appropriate values for strength coefficient and strain hardening exponent for the metal out of which the nail is made (Table 3.5), compute the maximum force in the heading operation to form the head.",Answer. Student exercise. Calculations similar to those above for the data developed by the student.

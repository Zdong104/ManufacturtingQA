"Which of the following soldering methods are not used for brazing (more than one)? (a) dip soldering, (b) infrared soldering, (c) soldering iron, (d) torch soldering, and (e) wave soldering.",Answer. (c) and (e).
"Which one of the following is not a function of a flux in brazing or soldering? (a) chemically etch the surfaces to increase roughness for better adhesion of the filler metal, (b) promote wetting of the surfaces, (c) protect the faying surfaces during the process, or (d) remove or inhibit formation of oxide films,",Answer. (a)
"Which type of soldering flux is preferred for electrical and electronics connections? (c) inorganic fluxes such as zinc chloride, (b) natural rosin fluxes, (c) water-soluble organic fluxes.",Answer. (a) Preferred because it is water-soluble.

"Weldbonding is an adhesive joining method in which heat is used to melt the adhesive: (a) true, or (b) false.",Answer. (b) Weldbonding is a combination of adhesive bonding and spot welding.

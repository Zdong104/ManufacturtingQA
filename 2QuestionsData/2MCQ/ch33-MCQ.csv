Question,Answer
"Most externally threaded fasteners are produced by: (a) cold forming, or (b) machining.",Answer. (a)
"Which of the following methods is used for applying the required torque to achieve a desired preload of a threaded fastener (more than one)? (a) sense of feel by a human operator, (b) snap fit, (c) stall-motor wrenches, or (d) torque wrench.","Answer. (a), (c), and (d)"
"Which of the following are reasons for using mechanical assembly (more than one)? (a) ease of assembly, (b) ease of disassembly, (c) in some cases involves a melting of the base parts, and (d) no heat affected zone in the base parts.","Answer. (a), (b), and (d). Answer (c) certainly includes the scope of mechanical assembly but it is not a reason for using it."
"Which of the following are the common ways in which threaded fasteners fail during tightening (more than one)? (a) excessive pressure applied to the bolt or screw head by the tightening tool (e.g., screwdriver) resulting in failure of the head, (b) excessive shearing stresses on the threads due to inadequate length of engagement, (c) excessive tensile stresses, or (d) stripping of the internal or external threads.","Answer. (b), (c), and (d)"
"The difference between a shrink fit and an expansion fit is that in a shrink fit the internal part is cooled to a sufficiently low temperature to reduce its size for assembly, whereas in an expansion fit, the external part is heated sufficiently to increase its size for assembly. When brought back to room temperature in either case, an interference fit is formed. (a) true, or (b) false.","Answer. (b). In a shrink fit the external part is heated and then cooled to shrink it onto the internal part. In an expansion fit, the internal part is cooled to contract it for assembly; it then expands to form the interference fit."
"The advantages of snap fit assembly include which of the following (more than one)? (a) assembly can be accomplished quickly, (b) no special tools are required, (c) the components can be designed with features that facilitate parts mating, and (d) the resulting joint is stronger than with most other assembly methods.","Answer. (a), (b), and (c). Snap fit joints are not recognized as being stronger than joints produced by other assembly methods."
"The difference between industrial stitching and stapling is that the U-shaped fasteners are formed during the stitching process while in stapling the fasteners are preformed: (a) true, or (b) false.",Answer. (a)
"From the standpoint of assembly cost, it is more desirable to use many small threaded fasteners rather than few large ones in order to distribute the stresses more uniformly: (a) true, or (b) false.","Answer. (b) From the standpoint of assembly cost, it is more desirable to use few large threaded fasteners rather than many small ones because the large fasteners are easier to handle and since there are fewer of them, they require less assembly time."
"Which of the following are considered good product design rules for automated assembly (more than one)? (a) design the assembly with the fewest number of components possible; (b) design the product using bolts and nuts wherever possible to allow for disassembly; (c) design with as many different fastener types as possible to achieve maximum flexibility in design; (d) design parts with asymmetric features to mate with other parts having corresponding (but reverse) features, so as to minimize the number of ways the parts will go together, and (e) limit the required directions of access when adding components to a base part.",Answer. (a) and (e). All of the other answers go against design-for-assembly principles.

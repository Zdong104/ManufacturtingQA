Question,Answer
What are the characteristics that distinguish bulk deformation processes from sheet metal processes?,"Answer. In bulk deformation, the shape changes are significant, and the workparts have a low area-to-volume ratio. In sheet metal processes, the area-to-volume ratio is high."
Extrusion is a fundamental shaping process. Describe it.,"Answer. Extrusion is a compression process in which the work material is forced to flow through a die orifice, thereby forcing its cross-section to assume the profile of the orifice."
Why is the term pressworking often used for sheet metal processes?,Answer. Because these operations are generally performed on presses.
What is the difference between deep drawing and bar drawing?,Answer. Deep drawing is a sheet metal forming process used to fabricate cup-shaped parts; bar drawing is a bulk deformation process used to reduce the diameter of a cylindrical workpart.
Indicate the mathematical equation for the flow curve.,Answer. The flow curve is defined in Eq. (18.1) as Yf = KÎµn.
How does increasing temperature affect the parameters in the flow curve equation?,Answer. Increasing temperature decreases both K and n in the flow curve equation.
Indicate some of the advantages of cold working relative to warm and hot working.,"Answer. Advantages of cold working are: (1) better accuracy, (2) better surface finish, (3) increased strength due to work hardening, (4) possible directional properties due to grain flow, and (5) no heating of work required."
What is isothermal forming?,Answer. An isothermal forming operation is performed in such a way as to eliminate surface cooling and thermal gradients in the workpart. This is accomplished by preheating the forming tools.
Describe the effect of strain rate in metal forming.,Answer. Increasing strain rate tends to increase the resistance to deformation. The tendency is especially prominent in hot forming operations.
Why is friction generally undesirable in metal forming operations?,"Answer. Reasons why friction is undesirable in metal forming: (1) inhibits metal flow during deformation, causing residual stresses and product defects; (2) increases forces and power required; and (3) wearing of the tools."
What is sticking friction in metalworking?,Answer. Sticking friction is when the work surface adheres to the surface of the tool rather than slides against it; it occurs when the friction stress is greater than the shear flow stress of the metal.

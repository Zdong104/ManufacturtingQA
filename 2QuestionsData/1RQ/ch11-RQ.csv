Question,Answer
Name the two basic categories of casting processes?,"Answer. The two categories are: (1) expendable mold processes, and (2) permanent mold processes."
There are various types of patterns used in sand casting. What is the difference between a split pattern and a match- plate pattern?,Answer. A split pattern is a pattern that consists of two pieces; a match-plate pattern consists of the two split patterns attached to opposite sides of a plate.
What is a chaplet?,Answer. Chaplets are metal supports of various designs used to hold the core in place in the sand mold.
What properties determine the quality of a sand mold for sand casting?,"Answer. The usual properties are: (1) strength - ability to maintain shape in the face of the flowing metal, (2) permeability - ability of the mold to allow hot air and gases to escape from the cavity, (3) thermal stability - ability to resist cracking and buckling when in contact with the molten metal, (4) collapsibility - ability of the mold to give way during shrinkage of the casting, (5) reusability - can the sand be reused to make other molds?"
What is the Antioch process?,Answer. The Antioch process refers to the making of the mold. The mold is 50% sand and 50% plaster heated in an autoclave and then dried. This mold has greater permeability than a plaster mold.
What is the difference between vacuum permanent-mold casting and vacuum molding?,Answer. Vacuum permanent-mold casting is a form of low- pressure casting in which a vacuum is used to draw molten metal into the cavity. Vacuum molding is sand casting in which the sand mold is held together by vacuum pressure rather than a chemical binder.
What are the most common metals processed using die casting?,"Answer. Common die cast metals include: zinc, tin, lead, aluminum, brass, and magnesium."
"Which die casting machines usually have a higher production rate, cold-chamber or hot-chamber, and why?",Answer. Hot-chamber machines are faster because cold- chamber die casting machines require molten metal to be ladled into the chamber from an external source.
What is flash in die casting?,"Answer. Flash is a thin portion at the exterior of a casting that results from molten metal being squeezed into the spaces between the die halves of the mold at the parting line, or into the clearances around the cores and ejector pins."
What is the difference between true centrifugal casting and semicentrifugal casting?,"Answer. In true centrifugal casting, a tubular mold is used and a tubular part is produced. In semicentrifugal casting, the shape is solid; an example is a railway wheel. The mold is rotated so that centrifugal force is used to distribute the molten metal to the exterior of the mold so that the density of the final metal is greater at the outer sections."
What is a cupola?,Answer. A cupola is a vertical cylindrical furnace equipped with a tapping spout near its base. Cupolas are used for melting cast irons.
What are some of the operations required of sand castings after removal from the mold?,"Answer. These operations include: (1) trimming, in which the sprues, runners, risers, and flash are removed, (2) core removal, (3) surface cleaning, (4) inspection, (5) repair if needed, (6) heat treatment, and (7) machining."
What are some of the general defects encountered in casting processes?,"Answer. General defects include: (1) misruns, (2) cold shuts, (3) cold shots, (4) shrinkage cavity, (5) microporosity, and (6) hot tearing."
"If a true centrifugal casting operation were to be performed in a space station circling the Earth, how would weightlessness affect the process?","Answer. The mass of molten metal would be unaffected by the absence of gravity, but its weight would be zero. Thus, in the G-factor equation (GF = v2/Rg), GF would theoretically go to infinity if g = 0. Thus, it should be possible to force the metal against the walls of the mold in centrifugal casting without the nuisance of “raining” inside the cavity. However, this all assumes that the metal is inside the mold and rotating with it. In the absence of gravity, there would be a problem in pouring the molten metal into the mold cavity and getting it to adhere to the mold wall as the mold begins to rotate. With no gravity the liquid metal would not be forced against the lower surface of the mold to initiate the centrifugal action."
"The housing for a certain machinery product is made of two components, both aluminum castings. The larger component has the shape of a dish sink and the second component is a flat cover that is attached to the first component to create an enclosed space for the machine parts. Sand casting is used to produce the two castings, both of which are plagued by defects in the form of misruns and cold shuts. The foreman complains that the thickness of the parts are too thin, and that is the reason for the defects. However, it is known that the same components are cast successfully in other foundries. What other explanation can be given for the defects?","Answer. Misruns and cold shuts result from low fluidity. One possible reason for the defects in this case is that the thickness of the casting cross-sections is too small. However, given that the casting of these parts is successfully accomplished at other foundries, two other possible explanations are: (1) the pouring temperature is too low, and (2) the pouring operation is performed too slowly."
A large steel sand casting shows the characteristic signs of penetration defect - a surface consisting of a mixture of sand and metal. (a) What steps can be taken to correct the defect? (b) What other possible defects might result from taking each of these steps?,"Answer. (a) What are the possible corrective steps? (1) Reduce pouring temperature. (2) Increase the packing of the mold sand to resist penetration. (3) Treat the mold cavity surface to make it harder. (b) What possible defects might result from each of these steps? In the case of step (1), the risk is for cold shuts and misruns. Steps (2) and (3) would reduce permeability of the sand, thus increasing the risk of sand blows and pin holes."

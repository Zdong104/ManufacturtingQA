Question,Answer
What is a production line?,Answer. A production line is a sequence of workstations at which individual tasks are accomplished on each work unit as it moves from one station to the next to progressively make the product.
Distinguish between a batch model production line and a mixed model production line.,"Answer. Both lines are used to make multiple product types. A batch model line produces the different products in batches, with a setup changeover between the products; while a mixed model line produces different products simultaneously."
What are the advantages of the mixed model line for producing different product styles?,Answer. Advantages of the mixed model line include: (1) no downtime between different models; (2) minimize or avoid high inventories of some models while there are stock-outs of other models; and (3) production rates can be matched to demand rates for different models.
What are some of the limitations of a mixed model line compared to a batch model line?,Answer. Limitations include: (1) line balancing problem is more complex; (2) scheduling the models is more difficult; and (3) getting the right parts to each workstation is more difficult because more parts are involved.
Identify two fundamental principles on which manual assembly lines are based.,"Answer. Three principles are described in the text: (1) specialization of labor, also known as division of labor, (2) interchangeable parts, and (3) work flow principle."
Describe how manual methods are used to move parts between workstations on a production line.,"Answer. The methods include: (1) work units are simply passed by hand along a flat worktable from one station to the next, (2) sometimes collecting them in boxes and then passing the boxes between stations; and (3) pushing the work units along a conveyor between stations."
Briefly define the three types of mechanized workpart transfer systems used in production lines.,"Answer. The three work transfer systems are: (1) continuous transfer, in which parts move on a conveyor at a steady speed; (2) synchronous transfer, in which parts all move simultaneously from station-to-station with a stop-and-go action; and (3) asynchronous transfer, in which parts move independently between stations with a stop-and-go action."
Why are parts sometimes fixed to the conveyor in a continuous transfer system in manual assembly?,Answer. Because the parts are big and/or heavy and cannot be conveniently removed by a human worker.
Why must a production line be paced at a rate higher than that required to satisfy the demand for the product?,Answer. Because all production lines will suffer a certain amount of nonproductive time due to reliability problems.
What are the reasons why the number of workstations cannot be determined simply from the ratio Twc/Tc?,"Answer. Reasons are: (1) line balancing losses, (2) repositioning time during Tc, and (3) multiple manning."
Why is the line balancing problem different on an automated transfer line than on a manual assembly line?,"Answer. Line balancing on an automated transfer line (e.g., machining) involves allocation of (usually) single machining operations to workstations. Line balancing on a manual assembly line (usually) involves assigning multiple work elements to workers or stations. There are many more possible solutions to the line balancing problem in the manual assembly case."
Repositioning time on a synchronous transfer line is known by a different name; what is that name?,Answer. The repositioning time is called the transfer time; it is the time to move parts from one station to the next.
Why are single station assembly cells generally not suited to high production jobs?,"Answer. The entire work cycle is performed at one station, so single station cells usually operate at relatively slow production rates."
What are some of the reasons for downtime on a machining transfer line?,"Answer. Reasons include: tool changes, sudden mechanical and electrical failures, and gradual normal wear and tear on the equipment."

Question,Answer
Define microelectromechanical system.,Answer. A microelectromechanical system (MEMS) is a miniaturized system consisting of both electronic and mechanical components.
What is the approximate size scale in microsystem technology?,"Answer. The size range is 10-6 m to 10-3 m, typically."
"Why is it reasonable to believe that microsystem products would be available at lower costs than products of larger, more conventional size?",Answer. Because less material is used in microsystem products.
What is a hybrid microsensor?,Answer. A hybrid microsensor is a sensing element (transducer) combined with electronics components in the same device.
What are some of the basic types of microsystem devices?,"Answer. The text indicates four classifications: (1) microsensors, (2) microactuators, (3) microstructures and microcomponents, and (4) microsystems and micro-instruments."
Why is silicon a desirable work material in microsystem technology?,"Answer. The reasons given in the text are: (1) the microdevices in MST often include electronic circuits, so both the circuit and the microdevice can be fabricated in combination on the same substrate; (2) in addition to its desirable electronic properties, silicon also possesses useful mechanical properties, such as high strength and elasticity, good hardness, and relatively low density; (3) the technologies for processing silicon are well-established, owing to their widespread use in microelectronics; and (4) use of single-crystal silicon permits the production of physical features to very close tolerances."
What is meant by the term aspect ratio in microsystem technology?,Answer. The aspect ratio is the height-to-width ratio of the features produced in the MST device.
What is the difference between bulk micromachining and surface micromachining?,Answer. Bulk micromachining refers to a relatively deep wet etching process into a single-crystal silicon substrate (Si wafer). Surface micromachining refers to the planar structuring of the substrate surface using much more shallow layering processes.
What is meant by the term nanotechnology?,"Answer. Nanotechnology refers to devices and structures that are even smaller than in microsystems, as well as the associated fabrication processes which involve the control of feature sizes measured on the nanometer (one nm = 10-9 m) scale."

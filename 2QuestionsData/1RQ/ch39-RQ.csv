Question,Answer
Define group technology?,Answer. GT is a general approach in which similarities among parts are identified and exploited in design and manufacturing.
What is a part family?,Answer. A part family is a collection of parts that are similar in design or manufacturing attributes.
Define cellular manufacturing?,Answer. Cellular manufacturing involves the production of part families using groups of machines (generally manually operated) to produce a certain part family or a limited set of part families.
What is the composite part concept in group technology?,"Answer. In GT, a composite part is a hypothetical part that includes all of the design and/or manufacturing attributes of a given part family. The concept is useful in designing cells to produce the part family."
Name some of the possible machine cell designs in group technology.,"Answer. GT machine cell designs include: single machines, multiple machines with manual handling, multiple machines with mechanized handling, flexible manufacturing cells, and flexible manufacturing systems."
What is a flexible manufacturing system?,Answer. A flexible manufacturing system (FMS) is an automated group technology cell consisting of processing stations interconnected by an automated handling system and controlled by a computer.
What makes an automated manufacturing system flexible?,"Answer. The tests of flexibility are: (1) process different part styles in non-batch mode; (2) accept changes in schedule, (3) deal gracefully with equipment breakdowns, and (4) accommodate new part style introductions."
Name some of the FMS software and control functions.,"Answer. Functions include: (1) NC part programming, (2) NC part program download, (3) production control, (4)machine control, (5) workpart control, (6) tool management, (7) work transport control, and (8) general system management."
Identify some of the applications of FMS technology.,"Answer. Applications include: machining, assembly, inspection, and sheet metal processing."
"What are the advantages of FMS technology, compared to conventional batch operations?","Answer. Advantages include: (1) higher machine utilization, (2) reduced work-in-process, (3)lower manufacturing lead times, and (4) greater flexibility in production scheduling."

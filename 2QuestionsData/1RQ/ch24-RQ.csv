Question,Answer
Define machinability.,Answer. Machinability can be defined as the relative ease with which a material can be machined using an appropriate cutting tool under appropriate cutting conditions.
What are the criteria by which machinability is commonly assessed in a production machining operation?,"Answer. The machinability criteria include: (1) tool wear and tool life, (2) forces and power, (3) surface finish, and (4) ease of chip disposal."
Name some of the important mechanical and physical properties that affect the machinability of a work material.,"Answer. The properties mentioned in the text include: hardness, strength, and thermal diffusivity."
Why do costs tend to increase when better surface finish is required on a machined part?,"Answer. Because additional operations such as grinding, lapping, or similar finishing processes must be included in the manufacturing sequence at higher cost."
What are the basic factors that affect surface finish in machining?,"Answer. The factors that affect surface finish are: (1) geometric factors such as type of operation, feed, and tool shape (nose radius in particular); (2) work material factors such as built-up edge effects, and tearing of the work surface when machining ductile materials, which factors are affected by cutting speed; and (3) vibration and machine tool factors such as setup and workpart rigidity, and backlash in the feed mechanism."
What are the parameters that have the greatest influence in determining the ideal surface roughness Ri ?,"Answer. The ideal surface roughness is determined by geometric parameters of the machining operation. These parameters are: (1) the type of machining operation, e.g., whether turning or milling, (2) tool nose radius, and (3) feed or chip load, and (4) in some cases the end cutting edge of the tool."
Name some of the steps that can be taken to reduce or eliminate vibrations in machining.,Answer. Steps to reduce vibration in machining include: (1) increase stiffness or damping in the setup; (2) operating at speeds away from the natural frequency of the machine tool system; and (3)	reducing forces in machining through changes in feed or depth and changes in cutter design.
What are the factors on which the selection of feed in a machining operation should be based?,"Answer. The factors are: (1) type of tooling, (2) roughing or finishing operation, (3) limiting cutting forces, and (4) surface roughness requirements."
"The unit cost in a machining operation is the sum of four cost terms. The first three terms are: (1) part load/unload cost, (2) cost of time the tool is actually cutting the work, and (3) the cost of the time to change the tool. What is the fourth term?","Answer. The fourth term is the cost of purchasing (and grinding, if applicable) the tool."
"Which cutting speed is always lower for a given machining operation, cutting speed for minimum cost or cutting speed for maximum production rate? Why?","Answer. Cutting speed for minimum cost. The fourth term in the unit cost equation, dealing with the actual cost of the cutting edge, tends to push the U-shaped function toward a lower value in the case of cutting speed for minimum cost."
"A face milling operation is not yielding the required surface finish on the work. The cutter is a four-tooth insert type face milling cutter. The machine shop foreman thinks the problem is that the work material is too ductile for the job, but this property tests well within the ductility range for the material specified by the designer. Without knowing any more about the job, what changes in cutting conditions and tooling would you suggest to improve the surface finish?","Answer. Changes in cutting conditions: (1) decrease chip load f, (2) increase cutting speed v, (3) use cutting fluid. Changes in tooling: (1) increase nose radius NR, (2) increase rake angle, and (3) increase relief angle. Items (2) and (3) will have a marginal effect."

Question,Answer
What is a polymer?,"Answer. A polymer is a compound that consists of long-chain molecules. The molecules consist of repeating units, called mers, connected end to end."
What are the three basic categories of polymers?,"Answer. The categories are: (1) thermoplastics, (2) thermosetting polymers, and (3) elastomers."
How do the properties of polymers compare with those of metals?,"Answer. In general, polymers have lower strength, hardness, stiffness, density, and temperature resistance compared to metals. In addition, polymers are low in electrical and thermal conductivity."
What are the two methods by which polymerization occurs? Briefly describe the two methods.,"Answer. The two types of polymerization are: (1) addition or chain polymerization and (2) step polymerization, also known as condensation polymerization."
What does the degree of polymerization indicate?,Answer. The degree of polymerization indicates the average number of mers or repeating units in the polymer molecule.
Define the term tacticity as it applies to polymers.,Answer. Tacticity refers to the way the atoms or atom groups replacing H atoms in the molecule are arranged.
What is cross-linking in a polymer and what is its significance?,"Answer. Cross-linking is the formation of connections between the long-chain molecules in a polymer. It causes the polymer structure to be permanently altered. If the amount of cross-linking is low, the polymer is transformed into an elastomer; if cross-linking is significant, the polymer is transformed into a thermosetting polymer."
What is a copolymer?,"Answer. A copolymer is a polymer made up of two different types of mers, such as ethylene and propylene."
The arrangement of repeating units in a copolymer can vary. What are some of the possible arrangements?,"Answer. There are four possible arrangements of the mers along the chain: (1) alternating, (2) random, (3) block, and (4) graft."
What is a terpolymer?,Answer. A terpolymer is a polymer with three different mer types. An example is ABS (acrylonitrile -butadiene-styrene) plastic.
How are a polymer's properties affected when it takes on a crystalline structure?,"Answer. Density, stiffness, and melting temperature increase."
Does any polymer ever become 100% crystalline?,Answer. No.
What are some of the factors that influence a polymer's tendency to crystallize?,"Answer. Factors are: (1) only linear polymers can form crystals; (2) copolymers do not form crystals; (3) stereoregularity - isotactic polymers always form crystals, atactic polymers never form crystals, and syndiotactic polymers sometimes form crystals; (4) slow cooling from the molten states promotes crystal formation; (5) plasticizers inhibit crystal formation; and (6) stretching the polymer tends to promote crystallization."
Why are fillers added to a polymer?,Answer. Fillers are added to increase strength or simply to reduce the cost of the polymer.
What is a plasticizer?,Answer. A plasticizer is a chemical added to the polymer to make it softer and more flexible. It is often added to improve the polymer's flow characteristics for shaping.
"In addition to fillers and plasticizers, what are some other additives used with polymers?","Answer. Other additives include: lubricants - to reduce friction and improve flow; flame retardents; colorants; cross-linking agents, antioxidants, and ultraviolet light absorbers."
Describe the difference in mechanical properties as a function of temperature between a highly crystalline thermoplastic and an amorphous thermoplastic.,Answer. A highly crystalline TP retains rigidity during heating until just before its Tm is reached. An amorphous TP shows a significant drop in deformation resistance at its Tg as temperature is raised; it becomes increasingly like a liquid as temperature continues to increase.
What is unique about the polymer cellulose?,Answer. Cellulose is a polymer that grows in nature. Wood fiber contains about 50% cellulose and cotton fiber is about 95% cellulose.
The nylons are members of which polymer group?,Answer. Polyamides.
"What is the chemical formula of ethylene, the monomer for polyethylene?",Answer. C2H4
What is the basic difference between low density and high density polyethylene?,"Answer. LDPE has a branched structure and is amorphous. HDPE is linear and highly crystalline. These differences account for HDPE higher density, stiffness, and melting point."
How do the properties of thermosetting polymers differ from those of thermoplastics?,"Answer. Thermosets are more rigid, brittle, capable of higher service temperatures, and cannot be remelted."
Cross-linking (curing) of thermosetting plastics is accomplished by one of three ways. Name the three ways.,"Answer. The three ways are: (1) temperature-activated systems, in which elevated temperatures accomplish curing; (2) catalyst-activated systems, in which small amounts of a catalyst cause cross-linking; and (3) mixing-activated systems, in which two reactive components are mixed and curing occurs by their chemical reaction."
Elastomers and thermosetting polymers are both cross- linked. Why are their properties so different?,"Answer. Elastomers are lightly cross-linked, whereas thermosets are highly cross-linked. Light cross-linking allows extensibility; a highly cross-linked structure makes the polymer rigid."
What happens to an elastomer when it is below its glass transition temperature?,Answer. An elastomer is hard and brittle below its Tg.
What is the primary polymer ingredient in natural rubber?,Answer. Polyisoprene.
How are thermoplastic elastomers different from conventional rubbers?,"Answer. TPEs are different in two basic ways: (1) they exhibit thermoplastic properties, and (2) their extensibility derives from physical connections between different phases in the polymer."

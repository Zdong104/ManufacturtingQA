Question,Answer
What distinguishes machining from other manufacturing processes?,"Answer. In machining, material is removed from the workpart so that the remaining material is the desired part geometry."
Identify some of the reasons why machining is commercially and technologically important.,Answer. The reasons include: (1) its applicability to most materials; (2) its capability to produce a variety of geometries to a part; (3) it can achieve closer tolerances than most other processes; and (4)	it can create good surface finishes.
Name the three most common machining processes.,"Answer. The three common machining processes are: (1) turning, (2) drilling, and (3) milling."
What are the two basic categories of cutting tools in machining? Give an example of a machining operation that uses each of the tooling types.,"Answer. The two categories are: (1) single -point tools, used in operations such as turning and boring; and (2) multiple -edge cutting tools, used in operations such as milling and drilling."
Identify the parameters of a machining operation that are included within the scope of cutting conditions.,"Answer. Cutting conditions include: speed, feed, depth of cut, and whether or not a cutting fluid is used."
Define the difference between roughing and finishing operations in machining.,Answer. A roughing operation is used to remove large amounts of material rapidly and to produce a part geometry close to the desired shape. A finishing operation follows roughing and is used to achieve the final geometry and surface finish.
What is a machine tool?,Answer. A machine tool can be defined as a power-driven machine that positions and moves a tool relative to the work to accomplish machining or other metal shaping process.
What is an orthogonal cutting operation?,Answer. Orthogonal cutting involves the use of a wedge- shaped tool in which the cutting edge is perpendicular to the direction of speed motion into the work material.
Name and briefly describe the three types of chips that occur in metal cutting.,"Answer. The three types are: (1) discontinuous, in which the chip is formed into separated segments; (2) continuous, in which the chip does not segment and is formed from a ductile metal; and (3) continuous with built-up edge, which is the same as (2) except that friction at the tool-chip interface causes adhesion of the work material to the tool rake face."
Describe in words what the Merchant equation tells us.,Answer. The Merchant equation states that the shear plane angle increases when rake angle is increased and friction angle is decreased.
What is the specific energy in metal machining?,Answer. Specific energy is the amount of energy required to remove a unit volume of the work material.
What does the term size effect mean in metal cutting?,Answer. The size effect refers to the fact that the specific energy increases as the cross-section area of the chip (to x w) decreases.
What is a tool-chip thermocouple?,"Answer. A tool-chip thermocouple is comprised of the tool and chip as the two dissimilar (metallic) materials forming the thermocouple junction; as the tool-chip interface heats up during cutting, an emf is emitted from the junction which can be measured to indicate cutting temperature."

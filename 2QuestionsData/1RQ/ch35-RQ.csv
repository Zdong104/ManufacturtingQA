Question,Answer
What is an integrated circuit?,"Answer. An integrated circuit is a collection of electronic devices (e.g., transistors, diodes, resistors) that have been fabricated and electrically intraconnected onto the surface of a small flat chip of semiconductor material."
Name some of the important semiconductor materials?,"Answer. Important semiconductor materials include silicon (most important), germanium, and gallium arsenide."
Describe the planar process.,"Answer. The planar process refers to the fabrication of an IC chip by a sequence of layering processes - adding, altering, and removing layers to create the devices and their intraconnection on the IC chip."
What are the three major stages in the production of silicon-based integrated circuits?,"Answer. The three stages are: (1) silicon processing, to produce very pure silicon and shape it into wafers; (2) IC fabrication, in which layers are added, altered, and removed in selected regions to form electronic devices on the face of the wafer; and (3) IC packaging, in which the wafers are tested, cut into chips, and the chips are encapsulated in a package."
What is a clean room and explain the classification system by which clean rooms are rated?,"Answer. A clean room is a room or rooms where the air is purified to reduce airborne particles. The classification system indicates the quantity of particles of size 0.5 microns or greater per cubic foot of air. For example, a class 100 clean room contains 100 or fewer particles of size 0.5 microns per cubic foot."
What are some of the significant sources of contaminants in IC processing?,"Answer. Sources of contaminants include humans (bacteria, cigarette smoke, viruses, and hair), and processing equipment (wear particles, oil, and dirt)."
What is the name of the process most commonly used to grow single crystal ingots of silicon for semiconductor processing?,Answer. It is the Czocralski process.
What are the alternatives to photolithography in IC processing?,"Answer. Alternatives to photolithography are: electron lithography, X-ray lithography, and ion lithography."
What is a photoresist?,Answer. A photoresist is a polymer that is sensitive to light radiation in a certain wavelength range; the sensitivity causes either an increase or a decrease in solubility of the polymer to certain chemicals.
Why is ultraviolet light favored over visible light in photolithography?,"Answer. Because it has a shorter wavelength, the transferred images are sharper."
Name the three exposure techniques in photolithography.,"Answer. The three exposure techniques are: (1) contact printing, (2) proximity printing, and (3) projection printing."
What layer material is produced by thermal oxidation in IC fabrication?,Answer. SiO2 is grown on the surface of the Si wafer.
Define epitaxial deposition.,Answer. Epitaxial deposition involves growth of a crystalline structure on the surface of a substrate which is an extension of the substrate's structure.
What are some of the important design functions of IC packaging?,"Answer. Design functions of IC packaging include: provide electrical connections to external circuits, encase chip for protection, and heat dissipation."
What is Rent's Rule?,"Answer. Rent's Rule indicates the number of input/output terminals nio required for an integrated circuit of a given number of internal circuits nc; the Rent's Rule equation is: nio = C n m, where C and m are constants for a certain circuit type."
Name the two categories of component mounting to a printed circuit board.,Answer. The two types are: (1) through-hole mounting and (2) surface mount technology.
What is a DIP?,"Answer. DIP stands for dual in-line package, an IC package with two rows of terminals on each side of a rectangular body containing the IC chip."
What is the difference between postmolding and premolding in plastic IC chip packaging?,"Answer. Postmolding refers to the use of transfer molding of epoxy around the chip and leadframe to form the package; a premolded package is one in which an enclosure is molded beforehand, and the chip and leadframe are then attached to it, adding a solid lid to complete the package."

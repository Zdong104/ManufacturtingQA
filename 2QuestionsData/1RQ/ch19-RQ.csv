Question,Answer
What are the reasons why the bulk deformation processes are important commercially and technologically?,"Answer. Reasons why the bulk deformation processes are important include: (1) they are capable of significant shape change when hot working is used, (2) they have a positive effect on part strength when cold working is used, and (3) most of the processes produce little material waste; some are net shape processes."
List some of the products produced on a rolling mill.,"Answer. Rolled products include flat sheet and plate stock, round bar and rod stock, rails, structural shapes such as I-beams and channels."
Identify some of the ways in which force in flat rolling can be reduced.,"Answer. Ways to reduce force in flat rolling include: (1) use hot rolling, (2) reduce draft in each pass, and (3) use smaller diameter rolls."
What is a two-high rolling mill?,Answer. A two-high rolling mill consists of two opposing rolls between which the work is compressed.
What is a reversing mill in rolling?,Answer. A reversing mill is a two-high rolling mill in which the direction of rotation of the rolls can be reversed to allow the work to pass through from either side.
"Besides flat rolling and shape rolling, identify some additional bulk forming processes that use rolls to effect the deformation.","Answer. Some other processes that use rolls are ring rolling, thread rolling, gear rolling, roll piercing, and roll forging."
"One way to classify forging operations is by the degree to which the work is constrained in the die. By this classification, name the three basic types.","Answer. The three basic types are: (1) open die forging, (2) impression die forging, and (3) closed die forging."
Why is flash desirable in impression die forging?,Answer. Because its presence constrains the metal in the die to fill the details of the die cavity.
What are the two basic types of forging equipment?,"Answer. The two types of forging machines are hammers, which impact the workpart, and presses, which apply a gradual pressure to the work."
What is isothermal forging?,Answer. Isothermal forging is a hot forging operation in which the die surfaces are heated to reduce heat transfer from the work into the tooling.
Name some products that are produced by extrusion.,"Answer. Products produced by continuous extrusion include: structural shapes (window frames, shower stalls, channels), tubes and pipes, and rods of various cross-section. Products made by discrete extrusion include: toothpaste tubes, aluminum beverage cans, and battery cases."
What does the centerburst defect in extrusion have in common with the roll piercing process?,Answer. They are both examples of how compressive stresses applied to the outside surface of a solid cylindrical cross-section can create high tensile stresses in the interior of the cylinder.
"In a wire drawing operation, why must the drawing stress never exceed the yield strength of the work metal?","Answer. Because if the drawing stress exceeded the yield strength, the metal on the exit side of the draw die would stretch rather than force metal to be drawn through the die opening."

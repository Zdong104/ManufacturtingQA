Question,Answer
Why are metals coated?,"Answer. (1) Corrosion protection, (2) enhance appearance, (3) provide a specified color, and (4) prepare surface for subsequent processing."
Identify the most common types of coating processes.,"Answer. The common coating processes are: (1) plating, (2) chemical surface treatments, such as anodizing, (3) vapor deposition processes such as PVD and CVD, (4) organic coating - painting, (5) porcelain enameling, and (6) thermal and mechanical treatments."
What are the many reasons why a metallic surface is plated?,"Answer. The reasons are: (1) corrosion protection of the substrate metal, (2) attractive appearance, (3) wear resistance, (4) increased electrical conductivity, (5) improved solderability, and (6) enhanced lubricity of the surface."
What is meant by the term cathode efficiency in electroplating?,Answer. The cathode efficiency is the actual amount of metal deposited on the surface relative to the theoretical amount given by Eq. (33.1).
What are the two basic mechanisms of corrosion protection?,"Answer. The mechanisms are (1) barrier protection, in which the coating simply covers the substrate to protect it, and (2) sacrificial protection, in which the coating metal corrodes sacrificially to protect the substrate."
What is the most commonly plated substrate metal?,Answer. Steel.
One of the mandrel types in electroforming is a solid mandrel. How is the part removed from a solid mandrel?,"Answer. A solid mandrel has certain geometric features, such as a taper, that permit the part to be removed. Parts are also sometimes removed by taking advantage of a difference in coefficient of thermal expansion."
How does electroless plating differ from electrochemical plating?,Answer. Electroless plating uses only chemical reactions to form the plating; electroplating uses electrolysis.
What is a conversion coating?,"Answer. A conversion coating is a thin coating produced by chemical reaction of the metallic surface. The most common conversion coatings are phosphates, chromates, and oxides."
How does anodizing differ from other conversion coatings?,Answer. Anodizing uses electrochemical processing methods to convert the metallic surface. Best example is aluminum anodizing.
What is physical vapor deposition?,Answer. Physical vapor deposition (PVD) refers to a family of processes in which a material is converted to its vapor phase in a vacuum chamber and condensed onto a substrate surface as a very thin film.
What is the difference between physical vapor deposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD)?,"Answer. In PVD, the coating vapors are synthesized by heating the coating material and allowing it to condense as a thin film on the surface of the workpart. In CVD a coating is formed on a heated substrate by the chemical reaction or dissociation of vapors and/or gases; the reaction product nucleates and grows on the substrate surface."
What are some of the applications of PVD?,"Answer. PVC applications include: decorative coatings on trophies and automotive trim, antireflection coatings on optical lenses, deposition of metal in electronic connections, and cutting tool coatings (e.g., TiN)."
Name the three basic types of PVD.,"Answer. The three types are: (1) vacuum evaporation, (2) sputtering, and (3) ion plating."
What is a commonly used coating material deposited by PVD onto cutting tools?,Answer. Titanium nitride (TiN). Titanium carbide (TiC) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) might also be mentioned.
Define sputtering yield?,Answer. Sputtering yield is defined as the number of atoms ejected from the surface of a substance per ion bombarding the surface.
What are some of the advantages of chemical vapor deposition?,Answer. Advantages include: (1) capability to deposit refractory materials at temperatures below their melting or sintering temperatures; (2) grain size control; (3) process is performed at atmospheric pressure; and (4) good bonding to substrate surface.
What are the two most common titanium compounds that are coated onto cutting tools by chemical vapor deposition?,Answer. TiC and TiN.
Identify the four major types of ingredients in organic coatings?,"Answer. The major ingredients are: (1) binder, which are polymers, (2) dyes or pigments, which provide color, (3) solvents, and (4) additives such as surfactants and plasticizers."
What is meant by the term transfer efficiency in organic coating technology?,Answer. Transfer efficiency indicates how much of the organic coating liquid reaches the target surface.
Describe the principal methods by which organic coatings are applied to a surface.,"Answer. The main methods include: brushing and rolling, spraying, immersion (dip coating), and flow coating. These methods are described in Article 33.4.2."
The terms drying and curing have different meanings; indicate the distinction.,Answer. Drying means evaporation of solvents in the organic coating liquid. Curing involves a chemical change in the organic resin (polymerization and/or cross-linking) which hardens the coating.
"In porcelain enameling, what is frit?",Answer. Frit is glassy porcelain prepared as fine particles (powders) by crushing and milling.
What does the term mechanical galvanizing refer to?,"Answer. Mechanical galvanizing refers to the mechanical plating of zinc onto a substrate, with thicknesses up to 0.003 in."

Question,Answer
What are the two principal aspects of cutting tool technology?,Answer. The two main aspects of cutting tool technology are: (1) tool material and (2) tool geometry.
Name the three modes of tool failure in machining.,"Answer. The three tool failure modes are: (1) fracture failure, (2) temperature failure, and (3) gradual wear."
What are the two principal locations on a cutting tool where tool wear occurs?,"Answer. Wear occurs on the top face of the cutting tool as crater wear and on the side or flank of the tool, called flank wear. Portions of flank wear are often identified separately as notch wear, corresponding to the surface of the work; and nose radius wear, corresponding to the tool point."
Identify the mechanisms by which cutting tools wear during machining.,"Answer. The important tool wear mechanisms are: (1) abrasion, (2) adhesion, (3) diffusion, and (4) plastic deformation of the cutting edge."
What is meant by the parameter C in the Taylor tool life equation?,Answer. The parameter C is the cutting speed corresponding to a one-minute tool life. C is the speed-axis intercept on the log-log plot of the tool life data.
"In addition to cutting speed, what other cutting variables are included in the expanded version of the Taylor tool life equation?","Answer. The expanded version of the Taylor equation can include any of the following: feed, depth of cut, and/or work material hardness."
What are some of the tool life criteria used in production machining operations?,"Answer. Production tool life criteria include: (1) complete failure of the tool, (2) visual observation of flank or crater wear, (3) fingernail test to feel flank wear, (4) sound of the tool, (5) chip disposal problems, (6) degradation of finish, (7) power increase, (8) workpiece count, and (9) length of cutting time for the tool."
Identify three desirable properties of a cutting tool material.,"Answer. Three desirable properties are: (1) toughness to resist fracture failure, (2) hot hardness to resist temperature failure, and (3) wear resistance to prolong the life of the tool during gradual wear."
What are the principal alloying ingredients in high speed steel?,"Answer. Principal alloying ingredients in HSS are: (1) either tungsten or a combination of tungsten and molybdenum, (2) chromium, (3) vanadium, and (4) carbon. Some grades of HSS also contain cobalt."
What is the difference in ingredients between steel cutting grades and non-steel cutting grades of cemented carbides?,Answer. The non-steel cutting grades contain only WC and Co. The steel cutting grades contain TiC and/or TaC in addition to WC-Co.
Identify some of the common compounds that form the thin coatings on the surface of coated carbide inserts.,"Answer. The common coatings are: TiN, TiC, and Al2O3."
Name the seven elements of tool geometry for a single point cutting tool.,"Answer. The seven elements of single point tool geometry are: (1) back rake angle, (2) side rake angle, (3) end relief angle, (4) side relief angle, (5) end cutting edge angle, (6) side cutting edge angle, and (7) nose radius."
Why are ceramic cutting tools generally designed with negative rake angles?,"Answer. Ceramics possess low shear and tensile strength but good compressive strength. During cutting, this combination of properties is best exploited by giving the tool a negative rake angle to tend to load the tool in compression."
Identify the alternative ways by which a cutting tool is held in place during machining.,"Answer. There are three principal ways: (1) solid shank, in which the cutting edge is an integral part of the tool shank, an example being high speed; (2) brazed inserts, used for some cemented carbides; and (3) mechanically clamped inserts, used for most hard tool materials including cemented carbides and coated carbides, ceramics, cermets, SPD, and CBN."
Name the two main categories of cutting fluid according to function.,Answer. The two functional categories of cutting fluids are: (1) coolants and (2) lubricants.
Name the three main types of cutting fluid according to chemistry.,"Answer. The three types of cutting fluids are: (1) cutting oils, (2) emulsified oils, and (3) chemical and semi- chemical fluids."
What is the principal lubricating mechanism by which cutting fluids work?,"Answer. There are two lubricating mechanisms that are believed to be effective in metal cutting: (1) boundary lubrication, which involves the formation of a thin fluid film to help separate and protect the contacting surfaces; and (2) extreme pressure lubrication, in which a thin solid layer of a salt such as iron sulfide is formed on the tool surface to provide lubrication."
What are the methods by which cutting fluids are applied in a machining operation?,"Answer. The most common method of application is flooding, in which a steady stream of fluid is direct at the operation. Other methods include: mist application, fluid- hole delivery, and manual application."
Why are cutting fluid filter systems becoming more common and what are their advantages?,"Answer. Cutting fluid filter systems are becoming more common due to the environmental protection laws and the need to prolong the life of the fluid before disposal. Advantages of filter systems include: longer fluid life, reduced disposal costs, better hygiene, lower machine tool maintenance, and longer cutting tool life."
Dry machining is being considered by machine shops because of certain problems inherent in the use of cutting fluids. (a) What are those problems associated with the use of cutting fluids? (b) What are some of the new problems introduced by machining dry?,"Answer. (a) Cutting fluids become contaminated over time with a variety of contaminants, including tramp oil, garbage, small chips, molds, fungi, and bacteria. In addition to causing odors and health hazards, contaminated cutting fluids do not perform their lubricating function as well as when they are fresh and clean. (b)	Problems with dry machining include: (1) overheating the tool, (2) operating at lower cutting speeds and production rates to prolong tool life, and (3) absence of chip removal benefits in grinding and milling."
"A turning operation is performed on a steel shaft with diameter = 5.0 in and length = 32 in. A slot or keyway has been milled along its entire length. The turning operation reduces the shaft diameter. For each of the following tool materials, indicate whether or not it is a reasonable candidate to use in the operation: (a) plain carbon steel, (b) high speed steel, (c) cemented carbide, (d) ceramic, and (e) sintered polycrystalline diamond. For each material that is not a good candidate, give the reason why it is not.","Answer. The slot will result in an interrupted cut, so toughness is important in the tool material. (a)	Plain carbon steel: not economical because of low cutting speeds. (b)	HSS: this is a reasonable candidate; it has good toughness for the interrupted cut. (c)	Cemented carbide: this is a reasonable candidate; it must be a steel cutting grade with high toughness (high cobalt content). (d)	Ceramic: this is not a good candidate because of its low toughness; it is likely to fracture during interrupted cutting. (e)	Sintered polycrystalline diamond: this is not suitable for cutting steel."

Question,Answer
What are the principal polymers used in fiber-reinforced polymers?,Answer. Principal polymer matrices in FRPs are unsaturated polyesters and epoxies.
What is the difference between a roving and a yarn?,"Answer. A roving consists of untwisted filaments, while a yarn consists of twisted fibers."
"In the context of fiber reinforcement, what is a mat?",Answer. A mat is a felt consisting of randomly oriented fibers held loosely together in a binder.
Why do we say that particles and flakes are members of the same basic class of reinforcing material?,Answer. Flakes are simply particles that possess very low width-to-thickness ratios.
What is sheet molding compound (SMC)?,"Answer. SMC consists of TS polymer resin, fillers, and chopped glass fibers, all rolled into a sheet of typical thickness = 0.250 inch."
How is a prepreg different from a molding compound?,Answer. Prepregs have continuous fibers rather than chopped fibers as in molding compounds.
Why are laminated FRP products made by the spray-up method not as strong as similar products made by hand lay-up?,"Answer. Because in hand lay-up, orientation of the fibers is controlled; whereas in spray-up, the fibers in each layer are randomly oriented."
What is the difference between the wet lay-up approach and the prepreg approach in hand lay-up?,"Answer. In wet lay-up, the layer of fiber reinforcement is placed into the mold dry, and the uncured resin is then applied to it to form the composite laminate. In the prepreg approach, layers of fiber preimpregnated with resin are laid into the mold."
What is an autoclave?,Answer. An autoclave is an enclosed chamber which can supply heat and/or pressure at controlled levels.
What are some of the distinguishing characteristics of the closed mold processes for PMCs?,Answer. Characteristics include: (1) they use molds consisting of two halves that open and close during the molding cycle; (2) high pressure is generally associated with the process; and (3) the geometric shapes of the moldings are more complex in three dimensions.
Identify some of the different forms of PMC molding compounds.,"Answer. PMC molding compounds include SMCs, TMCs, and BMCs."
What is preform molding?,Answer. Preform molding is a compression molding process in which a precut mat is placed into the lower half of a mold together with a charge of thermosetting resin; the materials are then pressed between heated molds to cure the resin and produce a fiber-reinforced molding.
Describe reinforced reaction injection molding (RRIM).,Answer. RRIM involves the injection of resins that cure by chemical reaction together with reinforcing fibers into a closed mold. The resulting part is a fiber-reinforced (usually glass fiber) plastic molding.
What is filament winding?,Answer. Filament winding is a process in which resin- impregnated continuous fibers are wrapped around a rotating mandrel with the internal shape of the FRP product; the resin is cured and the mandrel is removed.
What is the advantage of computer numerical control over mechanical control in filament winding?,Answer. CNC allows independent control over mandrel rotation and carriage speed for greater flexibility in relative motions.
Describe the pultrusion process.,Answer. Pultrusion is a process in which continuous fibers are dipped into a resin and pulled through a shaping die (somewhat like an extrusion die) where the resin cures. The resulting sections are similar to extruded parts except that they are reinforced with continuous fibers.
How does pulforming differ from pultrusion?,Answer. Pulforming is pultrusion with the added operation of a shape change in the length (straight length becomes curved) and cross-section (different cross-sections throughout the length).
With what kinds of products is tube rolling associated?,Answer. Typical products include: bicycle frames and space trusses.
How are FRPs cut?,"Answer. Uncured FRPs are cut by methods which include: knives, scissors, power shears, steel-rule blanking dies, laser beam cutting, and water jet cutting. Cured FRPs are cut by WC and HSS cutting tools, diamond cutting tools, and water jet cutting."

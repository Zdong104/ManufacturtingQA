Question,Answer
How is measurement distinguished from inspection?,"Answer. In measurement, an unknown quantity is compared with a known standard and a value of the quantity is obtained using an accepted and consistent system of units. In inspection, a product characteristic is examined to see if it conforms to design specifications."
How does gaging differ from measuring?,"Answer. Gaging determines whether the product characteristic (e.g., dimension) satisfies the specification or not. Measuring determines the actual value of the characteristic."
What are the six fundamental quantities in metrology?,"Answer. The six quantities are: length, mass, time, electric current, temperature, and light radiation."
What is accuracy in measurement?,Answer. Accuracy is the degree to which the measured value agrees with the true value of the quantity of interest. It is a measurement procedure that is absent of systematic errors.
What is precision in measurement?,Answer. Precision in measurement is the degree to which random errors are minimized.
What is meant by the term calibration?,Answer. Calibration means checking the measuring instrument against a known standard.
"Besides good accuracy and precision, what are the desirable attributes and features of a measuring instrument?","Answer. The desirable features include: high resolution, ease of calibration, speed of response, wide operating range, high reliability, and low cost."
What is the rule of 10?,Answer. The rule of 10 means that the measuring instrument or gage must be ten times more precise than the object (part) being inspected.
Automated inspection can be integrated with the manufacturing process to accomplish some action. What are these possible actions?,"Answer. Possible actions discussed in text are: (1) parts sortation, and (2) feedback of data to adjust the process."
Give an example of a non-contact inspection technique.,"Answer. Non-contact inspection techniques include machine vision, laser measuring methods, and electrical field techniques."
What is meant by the term graduated measuring device?,"Answer. A graduated measuring device has markings (called graduations) on a linear or angular scale to measure an object's feature of interest (e.g., length)."
What are the common methods for assessing surface roughness?,"Answer. Common methods are: (1) comparison of the specimen surface with standard test blocks having known surface roughness values, and (2) stylus-type electronic instruments which measure average roughness."
What is a coordinate measuring machine?,"Answer. A CMM is an automated measuring machine consisting of a contact probe and a means to position the probe in three dimensions relative to workpart features and surfaces; when the probe contacts the part, the x-y-z coordinates are recorded."
Describe a scanning laser system.,"Answer. The scanning laser system uses a laser beam deflected by a rotating mirror to produce a beam of light that sweeps past an object. A photodetector on the far side of the object senses the light beam during its sweep except for the short time when it is interrupted by the object. This time period can be measured quickly with great accuracy. A microprocessor system measures the time interruption that is related to the size of the object in the path of the laser beam, and converts from time to a linear dimension."
What is a binary vision system?,"Answer. In a binary vision system, the light intensity of each pixel is reduced to either of two values (black or white, 0 or 1)."
Name some of the non-optical non-contact sensor technologies available for inspection.,"Answer. The technologies include: electrical fields (capacitance, inductance), radiation (X-ray), and ultrasonic techniques (high frequency sound)."

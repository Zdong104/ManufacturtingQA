Question,Answer
How do brazing and soldering differ from the fusion welding processes?,"Answer. In brazing and soldering, no melting of the base metal(s) occurs."
How do brazing and soldering differ from the solid state welding processes?,"Answer. In brazing and soldering filler metal is used, whereas in solid state welding no filler metal is added."
What is the technical difference between brazing and soldering?,Answer. In brazing the filler metal melts at a temperature above 840 degrees F (450 degrees C). In soldering the filler metal melts at a temperature of 840 degrees F or below.
Under what circumstances would brazing or soldering be preferred over welding?,"Answer. Brazing or soldering might be preferred if: (1) the base metals have poor weldability, (2) the components cannot tolerate the higher heat and temperatures of welding, (3) production rates might be faster and less expensive than welding, (4) joint areas might be inaccessible for welding but brazing or soldering is possible, and (5) the high strength of a welded joint is not a requirement."
What are the two joint types most commonly used in brazing?,Answer. Butt and lap joints.
Certain changes in joint configuration are usually made to improve the strength of brazed joints. What are some of these changes?,"Answer. In butt joints, the butting surface areas are increased in various ways such as scarfing or stepping the edges. In brazed or soldered lap joints, the overlap area is made as large as possible. Several of the adaptations are illustrated in the figures of this chapter."
The molten filler metal in brazing is distributed throughout the joint by capillary action. What is capillary action?,Answer. Capillary action is the physical tendency of a liquid to be drawn into a small diameter tube or other narrow openings in spite of the force of gravity. It is caused by the adhesive attraction between the liquid molecules and the solid surfaces that define the narrow openings.
What are the desirable characteristics of a brazing flux?,"Answer. A brazing flux should do the following: (1) inhibit the formation of oxides and other unwanted byproducts during the brazing, (2) have a low melting temperature, (3) have a low viscosity when melted, (4) be a good wetting agent, and (5) protect the joint until solidification occurs."
What is dip brazing?,Answer. The parts to be brazed are dipped into a molten salt or molten metal bath which supplies the heating for the operation.
Define braze welding.,"Answer. Braze welding is used for adding braze metal to a more conventional geometry weld joint, such as a V-joint. It differs from the typical brazing operation in that no capillary action occurs. It differs from a conventional welding operation in that no melting of the base metals occurs."
What are some of the disadvantages and limitations of brazing?,Answer. Disadvantages and limitations: (1) the strength of the brazed joint is generally less than that of a welded joint; (2) high service temperatures may weaken a brazed joint; (3) part sizes are limited; and (4) the color of the filler metal is often different than the color of the base metals.
What are the two most common alloying metals used in solders?,Answer. Tin and lead.
Why are rosins as soldering fluxes losing favor in industry?,"Answer. Since natural rosin is insoluble in water, chemical solvents must be used to remove the flux after the joining operation. These chemical solvents are hazardous to the environment and to humans."
What are the functions served by the bit of a soldering iron in hand soldering?,"Answer. The functions include: (1) provide heat to the parts, (2) melt the solder, (3) convey solder to the joint, and (4) withdraw excess solder from the joint."
What is wave soldering?,Answer. Wave soldering involves the flow of molten solder onto the underside of a printed circuit board to provide soldered connections between the component leads that project through holes in the boards.
List the advantages often attributed to soldering as an industrial joining process?,"Answer. Advantages of soldering: (1) lower heat energy required than brazing or welding, (2) various heating methods available, (3) good electrical and thermal conductivity of the joint, (4) capable of making air-tight and liquid-tight joints, and (5) ease of repair and rework."
What are the disadvantages and drawbacks of soldering?,Answer. (1) low mechanical strength unless reinforced and (2) elevated service temperatures can weaken the joint.
What is meant by the term structural adhesive?,"Answer. A structural adhesive is capable of forming a strong permanent joint between strong, rigid components."
An adhesive must cure in order to bond. What is meant by the term curing?,Answer. Curing is the chemical reaction in which the adhesive transforms from liquid to solid and in the process forms the surface attachment between the two adherends.
What are some of the methods used to cure adhesives?,"Answer. The curing methods include: chemical reaction between two components of the adhesive (e.g., epoxies), heating of the adhesive, use of ultraviolet light, and application of pressure."
Name the three basic categories of commercial adhesives.,"Answer. The categories are: (1) natural adhesives (e.g., starch, collagen); (2) inorganic adhesives (e.g., sodium silicate); and (3) synthetic adhesives (e.g., thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers such as epoxies and acrylics)."
What is an important precondition for the success of an adhesive bonding operation?,Answer. The surfaces of the adherends must be very clean. Special surface preparation is sometimes required immediately prior to application of the adhesive in order to insure cleanliness.
What are some of the methods used to apply adhesives in industrial production operations?,"Answer. Methods include: (1) manual brushing, (2) use of manual rollers, (3) silk screening, (4) use of flow guns, (5) spraying, (6) automatic dispensers, and (7) roll coating."
Identify some of the advantages of adhesive bonding compared to alternative joining methods.,"Answer. Advantages of adhesive bonding: (1) applicable to a wide variety of materials - similar or dissimilar, (2) fragile parts can be joined, (3) bonding occurs over entire surface area of joint, (4) certain adhesives are flexible after curing, thus permitting them to tolerate strains encountered in service, (5) low curing temperatures, (6) some adhesives are suited to sealing as well as bonding, and (7) simplified joint design."
What are some of the limitations of adhesive bonding?,"Answer. Limitations of adhesive bonding: (1) adhesively bonded joints are generally not as strong as other joining techniques, (2) the adhesive must be compatible with the adherend materials, (3) service temperatures are limited, (4) surfaces to be bonded must be very clean, (5) curing times can limit production rates, (6) inspection of the bond is difficult."

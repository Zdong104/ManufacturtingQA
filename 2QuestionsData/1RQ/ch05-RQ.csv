Question,Answer
What is a tolerance?,Answer. A tolerance is defined as the total amount by which a specified dimension is permitted to vary.
What are some of the reasons why surfaces are important?,"Answer. The reasons why surfaces are important include: aesthetics, safety, friction and wear, effect of surface on mechanical and physical properties, mating of components in assembly, and thermal electrical contacts."
Define nominal surface.,"Answer. The nominal surface is the ideal part surface represented on an engineering drawing. It is assumed perfectly smooth; perfectly flat if referring to a planar surface; perfectly round if referring to a round surface, etc."
Define surface texture.,"Answer. Surface texture is the random and repetitive deviations from the nominal surface, including roughness, waviness, lay, and flaws."
How is surface texture distinguished from surface integrity?,Answer. Surface texture refers only to the surface geometry; surface integrity includes not only surface but the altered layers beneath the surface.
"Within the scope of surface texture, how is roughness distinguished from waviness?","Answer. Roughness consists of the finely-spaced deviations from the nominal surface, while waviness refers to the deviations of larger spacing. Roughness deviations lie within waviness deviations."
Surface roughness is a measurable aspect of surface texture; what does surface roughness mean?,Answer. Surface roughness is defined as the average value of the vertical deviations from the nominal surface over a specified surface length.
What is the difference between AA and RMS in surface roughness measurement?,Answer. AA and RMS are alternative methods by which the average roughness value is computedã€‚
Indicate some of the limitations of using surface roughness as a measure of surface texture.,Answer. Surface roughness measurement provides only a single value of surface texture. Among its limitations are: (1) it varies depending on direction; (2) it does not indicate lay; (3) its value depends on the roughness width cutoff L used to measure the average.
Identify some of the changes and injuries that can occur at or immediately below the surface of a metal.,"Answer. The changes and injuries include: cracks, craters, variations in hardness near the surface, metallurgical changes resulting from heat, residual stresses, intergranular attack, etc."
What causes the various types of changes that occur in the altered layer just beneath the surface?,"Answer. Energy input resulting from the manufacturing process used to generate the surface. The energy forms can be any of several types, including mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electrical."
Name some manufacturing processes that produce very poor surface finishes.,"Answer. Processes that produce poor surfaces include: sand casting, hot rolling, sawing, and thermal cutting (e.g., flame cutting)."
Name some manufacturing processes that produce very good or excellent surface finishes.,"Answer. Processes that produced very good and excellent surfaces include: honing, lapping, polishing, and superfinishing."
